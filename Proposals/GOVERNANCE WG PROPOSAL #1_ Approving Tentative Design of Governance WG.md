🏋️**Point of Contact:**

@T I M#6903

💡**Description:**

- The aim is to start shaping our WG and get a sense of direction
- To do this, the DAO firstly needs to agree on key design choices of this WG, that are listed below:
    - **Meetings**
    > ‘Official’ weekly 30 min meetings each Friday, that are just one-topic-deep
    > Spontaneous task related meetings started by wg members to discuss stuff/receive feedback
    - **Expectations of the WG members?**
    > Identify what needs to be established/designed for each phase
    > Contribute to design docs like this
    > Be accountable for their tasks + complete them on time
    > Vote on intra-wg agreements
    > Vote on DAO-wide proposals
    > Initiate proposals where needed
    - **Milestones of this WG:**
    > ✅Collect ideas from the working group about what this wg is and what it does
    > ✅Synthesize those ideas
    > Develop rough consensus on these ideas
    > Determine consensus values
    > Develop documentation for governance (and update [dream paper](https://www.notion.so/Civics-Unplugged-s-Dream-DAO-A-Deeper-Dive-5142d24477064342b71267242f15749b))
    > Start testing the researched tooling
    > Draft charter / constitution for Dream DAO
    > Develop budget
    > Pay people / organizations out for the first time - especially reimbursing CU for expenses so far
    > Decide on how to + run elections for all working groups
    - **How does this WG change over time?**
    > Intergenerational Governance Leadership (1 Champ : 1 Builder)
    > More election-heavy approach (instead of just volunteering)
        > Establish terms 
        > Develop intra-WG lead elections
    - **How do we vote?**
    > Votes by the community should be done on Discord (with email notification) to ensure a quorum
    > Proposals are the primary way to bring things to the wg to secure a vote
    > Voting will be Majority for yes/no questions, and ranked choice when multiple options are to be considered
    > Minor decisions need to be logged, even if not formally voted on
    - **What do we vote on?**
    > wg-specific items
    > Operating rules: DAO structure, roles (new and sunset) for the DAO
    > Decentralization strategy
    > Long-term DAO strategy
    > Proposal brought within the wg
    > Proposals that affect the entire DAO but need governance review
    > Treasury issues: investment strategy, budget philosophy, funding process, fundraising process (deposits, recording of fund inputs across various mechanisms)
    > cross-wg tools, support, and communication
    - **Decisions for Phase 1:**
    > Tooling choices
    > Founding docs/foundational structure
    > Roles and permissions
    > Phase n milestones (can apply specifics to n+2 phases)
    > How new minting efforts get decided
    - **DAO’s involvement in governance in Phase 1:**
    > Governance wg should initiate Phase 1 proposals, and vote on which ones need DAO-wide votes
    > DAO-wide can propose items that are foundational as well (ensures broad thinking while limiting repetition)
    > DAO should get frequent comms from Governance wg to inform of decisions being considered or made.
    > Approval of new minting efforts
    - **Tooling we use during the Phase 1:**
    Task management
    Note-taking and storage
    Reward structure
    Funds storage and transfer
    Voting Platform
    Database/CRM
    Possibly vote on implementing Clarity/Sobol!
        
        ---
        
        Qualifications:
        > All require permission system that is easily managed 
        > Database (name, wallet address, contact information)l of people, roles and funders (Builders, Champions, etc.), recipients of fund and voting/funding status of all
