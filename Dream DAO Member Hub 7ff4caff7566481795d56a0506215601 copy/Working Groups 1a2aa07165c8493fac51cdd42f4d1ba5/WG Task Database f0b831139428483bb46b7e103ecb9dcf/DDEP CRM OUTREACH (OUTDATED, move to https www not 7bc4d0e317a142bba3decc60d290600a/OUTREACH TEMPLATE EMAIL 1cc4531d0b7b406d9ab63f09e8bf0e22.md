# OUTREACH TEMPLATE EMAIL

Hey X,

I hope you’re doing well and things at X are running smoothly. I’m Harry, the current Champion Co-steward at Dream DAO and wanted to reach out as we’re currently setting up our 3rd cohort of Dream DAO internships. 

In case you don’t know, the Dream DAO invests in the future of the web3 x social impact ecosystem by providing diverse Gen -Z’ers around the globe with the training, funding, mentorship, and opportunities they need to leverage the power of web3 to build a brighter future for humanity. As part of this mission Dream DAO runs the **Dream DAO Explorers Program** (DDEP), a **two-month internship program** for carefully selected Dream DAO Builders. So far, we’ve run **2 successful cohorts** where over **20 Explorers** have gained experience working across companies including Celo, Climate Collective, LOA Labs, dORG, Aera Force and Protein.

These are partnered internships, where our hosts benefit from not only receiving a skilled and specifically matched builder, but also through builder driven content creation such as ‘Learning Artifact’ blogs, essays and social media posts that are produced during and after internships, sharing insights into the host projects and the important work they’re doing. If this sounds interesting you can find out more information about the Dream DAO Explorers Program [here](../../../Key%20Projects%2076c20a84f2fa4ecb86f9777d4acdf932/Dream%20DAO%20Explorers%20Program%20Internship%20Host%20One-Pa%20228e991b62f1438bb7f587909803dd8c.md), and express your interesting in becoming a host organisation [here](https://ddephost.paperform.co/).  

If you’re able to hop on a call I’d love to explore the possibilities of X being involved in the DDEP program, feel free to send me some suitable times or book in a call [here](https://calendly.com/plantboi/intro_meeting)!

We look forward to hearing from you.

All the best,

Harry
