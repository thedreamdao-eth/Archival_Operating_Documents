Deadline: June 21, 2023
Peeps: Amanda Maritan, Timofei Dort-Golts, PlantBoi
Season: S3
Status: Done
WG: Grants

**Resources**

- General Funding Page: [https://eosnetwork.com/funding/](https://eosnetwork.com/funding/)
- How to Apply to the ENF Grant Framework: [https://eosnetwork.com/blog/eos-network-foundation-grant-framework-guidelines/](https://eosnetwork.com/blog/eos-network-foundation-grant-framework-guidelines/)
- Public Goods Funding on EOS: [https://eosnetwork.com/blog/public-goods-funding-on-eos-fostering-decentralized-growth-in-web3/](https://eosnetwork.com/blog/public-goods-funding-on-eos-fostering-decentralized-growth-in-web3/)
- Pomelo Website: [https://pomelo.io/grants](https://pomelo.io/grants)
- Pomelo Medium: [https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants](https://medium.com/@PomeloGrants)

My recommendation would be to look at the Grant Framework first. There are some links above for that or you can access it directly in the application portal on Github:

[https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework)

Start with the smaller tier as those have a better chance of passing. If you want to see previously accepted grants, you can go here:

[https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/blob/main/docs/accepted_grant_applications.md](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/blob/main/docs/accepted_grant_applications.md)

**This grant was a community-focused one rather than a developer-focused one that just got accepted and might be a good example:**

📌 **Grant Project Minimum Requirements**

- All code produced as part of a grant must be open-sourced, and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality.
    - We prefer MIT, but Apache 2.0, GPLv3, or Unlicense are also acceptable.
- We do not award grants for projects that have been the object of a successful token sale.
- Grant deliverables must contribute to the EOS Network first and foremost.
- As a general rule, teams are asked to finish a grant before applying for another one.
- Lastly, we do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering or criminal activities.
- We require all projects to create documentation that explains how their project works.
- At a minimum, written documentation is required for funding.

**Acceptance Recommendations**

- It presents a well-researched or tested concept, for which ideally you are able to show some prior work.
- You can demonstrate that the project will be maintained after completion of the grant, be it through an obvious commitment to the technology from your side, additional funding sources or an existing business model.
- Your team has proven experience with the relevant languages and technologies and/or a strong technical background. You will be asked to provide the GitHub profiles of your team members as part of your application, which we will examine these for past activity and code quality. Naturally, you can also link to projects on other platforms.
- Your application is rich in technical details and well-defined.
- You can clearly present how your project stands out among competitors or implements technology that doesn't exist in the ecosystem yet.

> **Grant Process (for New Proposals)**
> 

The Grant Process consists of four major components: the Application Process, the Approval Process, Milestone Reporting, and Payment(s). Payments will be made in EOS to the wallet specified in the Grant Application. The processes must be completed in order and there may be feedback loops in some of the processes as described below.

**Application Process**

The application process is completed through Github. You will need to fork the repository, change one of the forms, and submit it via a Pull Request as outlined in the steps below:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/fork) this repository
2. In your fork, create a copy of the Grant Application template [(applications/application-template.md)](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/blob/main/applications/application-template.md). If you're using the GitHub web interface, you will need to create a new file and copy the contents of the template inside the new one. **Please make sure you do not modify the template file directly.**
3. Name the new file after your project: `myproject_name.md`. Please make sure to put it in the `applications` directory. Make sure your filename does not have any spaces in it and ends with the `.md` extension.
4. Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more information you provide, the faster the review. Please refer to our [Grant guidelines for most popular grant categories](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/blob/main/docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md) and make sure your deliverables present a similar level of detail. To get an idea of what a strong application looks like, you can have a look at the following examples: [1](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/blob/main/applications/greymass-web-client-sdk.md), [2](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/blob/main/applications/oci-transaction-lifecycle.md). If you are applying for a smaller grant that solely consists of UI work, for example, you do not need to provide as much detail.
5. When your application is complete, create a Pull Request. Please note, the Pull Request should only contain *one new file*—the Markdown file you created from the template.
6. You will see a comment template that contains a checklist. You can leave it as is and tick the checkboxes once the pull request has been created. Please read through these items and check all of them.
7. Sign off on the [terms and conditions](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/blob/main/docs/T&Cs.md) presented by the [CLA assistant](https://github.com/claassistantio) bot as a Contributor License Agreement. You might need to reload the pull request to see its comment.
8. Your Grant Application is now complete. The ENF Committee or Evaluators will contact your for next steps.

### Overview

> Please provide the following:
> 
- **Name:** Dream DAO
- **Brief Description:** Dream DAO trains and funds Gen Z to explore web3 and use it to make the world a better place.
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the EOS Network or Antelope software.

**********Answer:**********

Dream DAO is not related to EOS Network yet, and we want to change that *(add more…)*

- **Reason for Interest:** *An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.*

**************Answer:**************

We believe that one of the best investments in humanity is Gen Z – the builders of the future. And, within Gen Z, we believe the highest leverage opportunity to realize their potential is to teach them how to leverage the most powerful emerging technology: web3.

The Dream DAO is the first organization to build a pipeline of Gen Z talent and to equip them to work effectively at the intersection of web3 and social impact. We aspire to attract the best young talent and to channel significant crypto capital to develop thousands of Gen Z civic innovators by 2030.

After all, Gen Z are the ones who will inherit the challenges we face today. They are also the ones who will need to address the challenges that have yet to emerge. We believe they are more than ready to start working on the solutions, disrupt entrenched power structures, and set empowering precedents for web3.

Web3’s ability to impact the world positively depends on the web3 builder community collectively looking a lot more like how the world looks like, and being more driven by social impact purpose.

Dream DAO will be a key driver in helping make this a reality.

### Project Details

> We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
> 

****Answer:****

The [Dream DAO](https://dreamdao.xyz/) is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization building a web3 x social impact ecosystem for supporting Gen Z leaders to enter the web3 space.

The DAO is run primarily by Gen Zers aged 15-20 years (**’Builders’**) with mentorship from experienced professionals in web3 and social impact (**’Champions’**). Each semester (or as we call it: Season), we assemble small cohorts of exceptional Gen Zers from around the globe and give them community, education, mentorship, and internship opportunities, as well as experience running a DAO through decentralized governance. Our goal is to transform students into builders ready to leverage web3 — starting with the Ethereum ecosystem — to secure a brighter future for humanity.

We are helping build the web3 x social impact ecosystem by investing in three complementary areas of focus:

1. **Empowering learning community:** The Dream DAO cultivates an empowering, intergenerational, global community and offers a range of learning and mentorship opportunities that help young people gain knowledge, confidence, and experience at the intersection of web3 x social impact. The core “product” of the learning community is the “Learning Together” series, which is hosted twice a week and features a community member, or guest, hosting a lecture on a web3 concept and spreading the word on the Solarpunk future we envision will come with web3 x social impact. As an example, we are so proud to say that the Ethereum Foundation director Aya Miyaguchi hosted a Learning Together session with us (Click here to see the recording: [https://www.notion.so/Dream-DAO-Learning-Together-28-Ethereum-as-Infinite-Garden-Discovering-Your-Why-371fb1c929124d4588fa670615fc0caa?pvs=4](../../Evergreen%20Documents%20976d2984e99f4146b4283457a2303a7c/Evergreen%20Documents%20Database%20db1ccc6322ae474dba4b59d6b687d080/Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20#28%20%E2%80%9CEthereum%20as%20Infin%20371fb1c929124d4588fa670615fc0caa.md)). 
Moreover, our new builders complete an intensive 3-week web3 ‘bootcamp’ run by their more experienced peers, allowing them to grasp key web3 basics and prepare to become contributors to the web3 ecosystem.
Additionally, we organize a 1:1 mentorship program, where we match champions and Gen Z builders to help the latter learn and grow in their specific field of interest.
2. **Web3 x social impact Internship Program:** Our Internship Program is a two-month program called the Dream DAO Explorers Program. It is available for 15-20-year-olds seeking to be and build the future of web3 x social impact. The program started on June 2022 in which Dream DAO builders were placed in web3 organizations (e.g. Aera Force, Climate Collective, dORG, LOA Labs), and was able to experience their first job opportunity in web3. You can learn more about the program here: [https://www.notion.so/Dream-DAO-Explorers-Program-Internship-Host-One-Pager-228e991b62f1438bb7f587909803dd8c](../../Key%20Projects%2076c20a84f2fa4ecb86f9777d4acdf932/Dream%20DAO%20Explorers%20Program%20Internship%20Host%20One-Pa%20228e991b62f1438bb7f587909803dd8c.md)
3. **IRL Regen web3 gatherings:** We convene diverse, inspiring, regen-minded thinkers and builders to forge relationships and collaborations across the “regen web3” movement. In-person convenings, such as our trips to Devcon Bogotá and ETH Mexico, fill attendees with inspiration. This is why Dream DAO funds some of our community members to travel to, co-organize, and hack at such events.

We are not a software company, but we still embody the spirit of open source. Everything we do, we build in public and are a huge proponent of public documentation.

### Ecosystem Fit

> Help us locate your project in the EOS Network landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:
> 
- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOS Network / Antelope ecosystem?
    - If so, how is your project different?
    - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

**************Answer:**************

There are currently few to no educational providers focused on helping diverse 15-20-year-olds learn how to use web3 to do good in the world.

In different ecosystems, some similar ones are Builder DAO and otherwise similar communities for youth builders: TKS, Atlas, RISE, etc. With Builder DAO, there is no focus on social impact (plus it has shut down). The other communities focusing on youth builders and social impact, are selective in nature and require previous knowledge and expertise, and are often paid programs.

Dream DAO is free and encourages passionate people who have little knowledge about web3 to apply and learn about the space, and it operates as a DAO. Furthermore, Dream DAO is focused on blockchain and web3 due to its potential to influence every single industry not only in a technical but also in an operational, hierarchal, and infrastructure way, and operating as a DAO is one way we show our commitment to this positive global transition.

Members of the Dream DAO will go on to build world-changing DAOs, create web3 x social impact projects that make unprecedented progress on entrenched social issues, and become moral and tech-savvy leaders of their respective industries. We owe it to our progeny to leave the world better than we found it. A web3 native institution that produces web3-powered civic superheroes is a public good if we've ever seen one.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](https://github.com/amandamaritan/dream-dao-grant/blob/main/docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We *recommend* that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. *Treat it as a contract*; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested *per milestone*.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> ⚡ If any of your deliverables is based on someone else's work, make sure you work and publish under the terms of the license of the respective project and that you highlight this fact in your milestone documentation and in the source code if applicable! Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.
> 

### Milestone Summary

> Note: the numbers in the three lines below are examples. Please replace with your own calculations! Then delete this instruction line. You must keep these three Milestone Summary lines below for your grant to be approved. The Total Cost should add up to the costs of all of your Milestones. Please DO NOT remove the three lines below. If you do, your grant will be rejected or delayed while you fix it.
> 
- **Total Estimated Duration:** 2 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 8 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 10,000 USD

> Please note that this application is automatically parsed.
> 
> 
> For the above fields, please only put the answer on that line. If you want to add more information, please put it below these instructions.
> 
> Please remember to delete all lines that start with `>` as they are just instructions and not needed in the application submission.
> 
> Notes on above fields:
> 
> - Total Estimated Duration: Duration of the whole project (example: 2 months or 7 weeks)
> - Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): This is the average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), example: 2 FTE or possibly 2.5 FTE as it is an average)
> - Total Costs: This should be the requested amount in USD for the whole project (example 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](https://github.com/amandamaritan/dream-dao-grant/blob/main/README.md#grant-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in EOS, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
