**A**:

Dream DAO invests in the future of the web3 x social impact ecosystem by funding, training, and providing opportunities to Gen-Z leaders interested in leveraging web3 technology towards a brighter future for humanity.

Since December 2021, the DAO has funded 20+ of these young ‘builders’ to attend web3 conferences such as Devcon VI, ETHMexico, and NFT NYC, and partnered with social impact orgs like AERA FORCE and Celo to secure builders 25+ inspiring web3 internships.

In the past months, we brought over 100+ teenagers to Ethereum, including hosting ‘Learning Together’ sessions to guide them in setting up their first ETH wallet and providing funding for them to buy their own domain. We also share our experiences with the wider ETH ecosystem from hosting panels during DevconVI to releasing a ‘How We DAO’ playbook.

During 2023, Dream DAO will continue to lead Gen-Z innovators to Ethereum events and organizations, providing them the support, mentorship and tools to build a better future.
