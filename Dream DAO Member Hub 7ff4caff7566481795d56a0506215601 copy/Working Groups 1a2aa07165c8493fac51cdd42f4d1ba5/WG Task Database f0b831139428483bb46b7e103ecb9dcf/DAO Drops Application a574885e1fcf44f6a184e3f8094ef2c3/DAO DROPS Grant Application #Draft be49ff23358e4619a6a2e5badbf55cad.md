**Q**: **Project / individual name**

**A**: Dream DAO

**Q**: **Why should they receive the funding? Tell us more!** * 1000 Char limit

**A**: 

Dream DAO invests in the future of the web3 x social impact intersection by funding, training, and providing opportunities to Gen-Z leaders interested in leveraging the world using the power of blockchain.

Since December 2021, the DAO has funded 20+ builders to attend web3 conferences such as Devcon VI, ETHMexico, and NFT NYC. In addition, partnered with social impact organizations like AERA FORCE to host 25+ Dream DAO builders to intern and gain their first web3 working experience.

In the past months, we brought over 100+ teenagers to the Ethereum ecosystem, hosting Learning Together sessions on how to set up their first ETH wallet and providing them with funding to buy their own domain. We also had the amazing opportunity to host a panel during Devcon Bogot√° and share the power of DAOs!

During 2023, Dream DAO expects to lead more Gen-Zs to Ethereum events and organizations, mentoring them to keep building the best tools and resources we need to assemble a Solarpunk future.
