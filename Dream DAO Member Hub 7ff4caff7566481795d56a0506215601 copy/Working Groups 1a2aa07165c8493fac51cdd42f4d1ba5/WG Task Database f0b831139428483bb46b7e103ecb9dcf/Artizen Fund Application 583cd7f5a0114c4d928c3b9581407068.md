LATEST EMAIL FORM RENE FROM ARTIZEN FUND TEAM:

Hi there!

I'm very happy to welcome you to apply for Season 3 and to get to know your project better. I've adjusted the process and suggest the following steps rather then 1:1 due to team scaling and resources.

Step I - Apply with a FINISHED project

Very carefully apply to Season 3. Be sure that the text is what you would like published to the site and that the Artifact is exactly what you would want to represent your final projects. We are offering limited edits going forward.

Artifact

Be sure your artifact is complete and fits all asset requirements: 1x1 image at 1000 x 1000 pixels. If you are adding a video, in addition, be sure it is under 90 MB and in Mp4 format and loops visually generally that means adding a fade in the beginning and end or starting the animation from the same point.

Deadline - The suggested Deadline for this is May 10th.

Step 2 - Promote your project

Once you have finished head over to our Discord and feel free to promote the project.

Step 3 - Join Community Onboarding

Attend a community onboarding once selected. The community onboardings will take place in Mid May and you will be sent an invite the week of May 10th once your project is selected. We will only be selecting finished projects.

Thanks for applying and looking forward to seeing your projects!!

All the best,

Dov

Hi Harry Fancy

Congratulations! The Artizen community loves your project **Dream DAO**. And as one of the top 30 highest voted projects, we'd be honored to extend an invitation for Dream DAO to be in our Official Selection for Season 3 of the Artizen Prize.

You might be asking yourself "but wait? I applied to season 2!" Here's the deal. Artizen is still in an experimental mode and due to some silly technical limitations we could only feature the top nine projects in Season 2. But for Season 3 we're lifting this restriction and want to include you in our lineup.

**Next steps:**

1. **Re-submit Your Project:** Unfortunately we do need you to submit your project again so it shows up in our [review app](https://artizen-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/22unnceHDtW5zqK1v0GZD8mo_GhfMFXhXc9avEIYJeRWebRx9hwGqsziOjrjhdPzQWBiIqwIjXcwjPllNcG1h86j0LQiaYmhYRpOSckr3_ZOyn2d8ZTJuqgGfVU-E9brAkFXPoWBgVCNYzmSOd_jWTadAonN8PzTLWuTxZEy3zcWl3XRp). But take this as an opportunity to add a little more fit and finish to your submission. Submit here: [https://artizen.link/submit](https://artizen-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2JadlR9cE4jxLGTAjM2Rfo7RBOJfQ8KXHhIDWRhpYKXCkbRx9hwEBzawVqqNsv_toOGwF7eho5tQseTt5V06coukz63fsivru1HSemFszej_2ZIgVT-MW1hIjR5hRYtLpKRhQ1Zc-vRCe2_1esulODuM8uYo_PQ8JFUszq8ky4V6ea7Z-6A)
2. **Schedule Meeting with Dov**: Please find a time to meet with our head of community Dov who is in CC. They will help get your project ready for Season 3 and answer any questions you might have: [https://calendly.com/dov_heichemer](https://artizen-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2ST2CcgzWPYK7Z2GHva_TdtNptbvndXrABsFKr8xx8eyrbRx9hwGQoY3U5kTT81rPFICu2RqZ3P5gMBkxM0bJG_DhTWJqYX7qHKphUUF1-ZAIIXSKYlsnlNT3_QmhJrzQNLA7AKZlSyWxooiPKnFAmsmvCI1M3axcxsbye80f-rLyR22gU2v0ng)
3. **Checkout Season 2**: I highly suggest you tune into Season 2, see what the projects in competition look like, and maybe consider buying an Artifact or two so you get a feel for how the system works: [https://artizen.fund/](https://artizen-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2CbRL1P6RzNUVsE7VCL-Q1xc7leVbCrNtQPB02p0_IRewbRx9hwEZ4FW1dw6VgaeHPd79DoXWcK4OhS2pQfVTDMfzptQqdLwYTsRyb3dhcVhsxu8CjiKfYqzJbymyfjwt65Ccun5Q7HshG4rfZE_DWRMMWjmjU3Owz2kS-JA4y7E)

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Such a fan of your work!

Cheers,

René
