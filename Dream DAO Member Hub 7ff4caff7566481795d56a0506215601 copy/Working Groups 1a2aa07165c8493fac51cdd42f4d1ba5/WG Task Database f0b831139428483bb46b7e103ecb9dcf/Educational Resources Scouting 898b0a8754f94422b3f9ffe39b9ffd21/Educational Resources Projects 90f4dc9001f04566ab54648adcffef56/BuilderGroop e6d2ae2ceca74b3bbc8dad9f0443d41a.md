# BuilderGroop

website: https://book.buildergroop.com/
 proposal: Amanda: we could have a DD group with builders and champs https://hacks.buildergroop.com/ during September, or maybe co-create a DD hackathon for s4 (we invite Cartesi to take part in this + Celo), open to DD builders and champs, but we could have 2-3 workshops and 1-2 challenges/bounties for external community @Rebeca Lissa @Timofei Dort-Golts @PlantBoi @Aaryan Chadha for thoughts 
how can this impact the DAOs learning?: I (Aaryan) know the co-founder and they have a lot of partners, docs, resources for young builders which would be very benefitial for DreamDAO
