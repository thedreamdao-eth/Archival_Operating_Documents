 proposal: Amanda: they have a research program, maybe we could talk about it with them, see if we can arrange a spot for DDEP and learning resources to builders, they also have a spot in NYC for networking etc, we could check if 1-2 champions could have a month membership or something @Timofei Dort-Golts @PlantBoi @Rebeca Lissa for thoughts 
how can this impact the DAOs learning?: A investment company that has individuals from TKS in it and might be willing to help DreamDAO with courses, partnerships with other clients of theirs in social impact * technology/web3 space
