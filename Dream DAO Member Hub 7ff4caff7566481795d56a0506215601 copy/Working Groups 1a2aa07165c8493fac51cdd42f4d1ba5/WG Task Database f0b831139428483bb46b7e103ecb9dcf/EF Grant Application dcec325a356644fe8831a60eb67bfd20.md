### **Tips for submitting a great application**

The information you submit here is what we'll use to make a final decision about your grant application, so take the time to understand what we're looking for and answer the form questions thoughtfully.

When evaluating your application, we look for much more than just an explanation of the proposed work. In order to determine the potential impact on the ecosystem, we need a deeper understanding of both the “why” and the “how” of the project. Some things to keep in mind:

- **Be specific:** we want you to share your grand vision - but you also need to tell us, concretely, how you plan to achieve your goals.
- **Be thorough:** the more information you can provide in a grant application, the better. We encourage you to provide any supporting documents such as whitepapers, research papers, or slides from presentations you've given about your project.
- **Show your work:** we expect you to have made a meaningful effort to validate and refine your approach and researched what other solutions are being developed, and to be able to articulate how yours is different.
- **Dig deeper:** we want to know what problem you're trying to solve, but also why you think it's important to solve that specific problem, how solving it will benefit Ethereum and how it fits within our mission.
- **Think broader:** how does your project connect to, complement and enable the work of others? How can you make sure your work stays relevant and has a sustained impact?
- **Identify output** (what is produced) as well as outcome (what is accomplished): what will be the tangible result of your work - a research paper, a code repo, a community event, a working prototype? Who will use it, and how will they access it?
- **Be realistic:** we'll consider the funding amount you request in relation to the proposed scope of work, so go with a number that reflects what you think you'll need for the specific work in your proposal. Remember that being awarded a grant now doesn't mean you can't apply for additional funding later!

4. ***Conference trips*** are also a key part of Dream DAO’s work, and we have sponsored builders to attend various conferences, including NFT NYC, web3 Conf Goa, and ETH Mexico since the DAO was launched. 

In Mexico, our builders won prizes for their amazing accomplishments: Julia Staxx become an ETH Mexico Finalist — Saf, Dariel, Rebeca, and Arath — won Best Public Goods by Polygon, and Joshua won Best UX + User Onboarding. Check our recap here: [http://youtube.com/watch?v=r603LXdSQjY](http://youtube.com/watch?v=r603LXdSQjY)
    1. In addition, 10 DAO members attended Devcon VI with Dream DAO in 2022, sharing their learnings and reflections from the conference [here](https://www.notion.so/Our-Devcon-Bogot-Learning-Artifact-3d0bfe5b968c4200b4b8e3e02063cf32?pvs=21) to help spread the knowledge acquired from the trip further. 
5. Dream DAO also frequently hosts ***Meet Ups*** which can ****provide a great way to enter and explore the web3 space. For example. in partnership with Celo we’ve hosted a meet-up at Yale University, introducing students and professors to web3 x social impact, Celo Org and the Dream DAO. You can check a recap video here: [https://twitter.com/DreamDAO_/status/1589680614655266816?s=20](https://twitter.com/DreamDAO_/status/1589680614655266816?s=20)

Q: **What is the project?*Describe the main concept and components of the proposed work.**

The [Dream DAO](https://dreamdao.xyz/) is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization building a web3 x social impact ecosystem for supporting Gen Z leaders to enter the web3 space.

The DAO is run primarily by Gen Zers aged 15-20 years (**’Builders’**) with mentorship from experienced professionals in web3 and social impact (**’Champions’**). Each semester (or as we call it: Season), we assemble small cohorts of exceptional Gen Zers from around the globe and give them community, education, mentorship, and internship opportunities, as well as experience running a DAO through decentralized governance. Our goal is to transform students into builders ready to leverage web3 — starting with the Ethereum ecosystem — to secure a brighter future for humanity.

We are helping build the web3 x social impact ecosystem by investing in three complementary areas of focus:

1. **Empowering learning community:** The Dream DAO cultivates an empowering, intergenerational, global community and offers a range of learning and mentorship opportunities that help young people gain knowledge, confidence, and experience at the intersection of web3 x social impact. The core “product” of the learning community is the “Learning Together” series, which is hosted twice a week and features a community member, or guest, hosting a lecture on a web3 concept and spreading the word on the Solarpunk future we envision will come with web3 x social impact. Most of the hosts are building in the Ethereum ecosystem. As an example, we are so proud to say that the Ethereum Foundation director Aya Miyaguchi hosted a Learning Together session with us (Click here to see the recording: [https://www.notion.so/Dream-DAO-Learning-Together-28-Ethereum-as-Infinite-Garden-Discovering-Your-Why-371fb1c929124d4588fa670615fc0caa?pvs=4](../../Evergreen%20Documents%20976d2984e99f4146b4283457a2303a7c/Evergreen%20Documents%20Database%20db1ccc6322ae474dba4b59d6b687d080/Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20#28%20%E2%80%9CEthereum%20as%20Infin%20371fb1c929124d4588fa670615fc0caa.md)). 
Moreover, our new builders complete an intensive 5-week web3 ‘bootcamp’ ran by their more experienced peers, allowing them to grasp key web3 basics and prepare to become contributors to the web3 ecosystem.
Additionally, we organize a 1:1 mentorship program, where we match champions and Gen Z builders to help the latter learn and grow in their specific field of interest.
2. **Web3 x social impact Internship Program:** Our Internship Program is a two-month program called the Dream DAO Explorers Program. It is available for 15-20-year-olds seeking to be and build the future of web3 x social impact. The program started on June 2022 in which Dream DAO builders were placed in web3 organizations (e.g. Aera Force, Climate Collective, dORG, LOA Labs), and was able to experience their first job opportunity in web3. You can learn more about the program here: [https://www.notion.so/Dream-DAO-Explorers-Program-Internship-Host-One-Pager-228e991b62f1438bb7f587909803dd8c](../../Key%20Projects%2076c20a84f2fa4ecb86f9777d4acdf932/Dream%20DAO%20Explorers%20Program%20Internship%20Host%20One-Pa%20228e991b62f1438bb7f587909803dd8c.md)
3. **IRL Regen web3 gatherings:** We convene diverse, inspiring, regen-minded thinkers and builders to forge relationships and collaborations across the “regen web3” movement. In-person convenings, such as our trips to Devcon Bogotá and ETH Mexico, fill attendees with inspiration. This is why Dream DAO funds some of our community members to travel to, co-organize, and hack at such events.

Q: **What problem(s) are being solved by within the scope of the grant?***
*What is the specific problems, research questions, or needs you are trying to address?*

Receiving a grant would enable us to solve many problems within the DAO, among them we highlight:

1. Being able to provide Dream DAO builders with educational experiences such as conferences and trips of educational interest in the web3 x social impact ecosystem, as well as local meetups in which builders around the world will have the opportunity to share their learning and knowledge around the Ethereum ecosystem as well as the web3 x social impact ecosystem as a community.
2. We will allocate an amount of it to logistics and incentives in the new learning programs designed for builders to prepare them in the web3 x social impact ecosystem, including our Explorers Program, Bootcamp and Mentorship Program. 

For Season 4 (July 2023 - Dec 2023):

1. Onboarding 40 new builders into the DAO and allocating a small amount of funds to new builders’ to practice using their wallets and get ENS addresses (each season we host an LT session about wallets and guide new builders through the creation process).
2. Operational costs: our DAO is run by our young leaders and our bounties, elected roles, and retroactive payments allow us to show them appreciation and reward their hard work, as well as support them to achieve some financial stability for their educational expenses, for example.

Q: **Why is your project important?**
**How do you know people need what you're making? Why is this project important for your target demographic/problem area?*

We believe that one of the best investments in humanity is Gen Z (the builders of the future) and, within Gen Z, we believe the highest leverage opportunity to realize their potential is to teach them how to leverage the most powerful emerging technology: web3. 

Our project is important because The Dream DAO is the first organization to build a pipeline of Gen Z talent and to equip them to work effectively at the intersection of web3 and social impact. We aspire to attract the best young talent and to channel significant crypto capital to develop thousands of Gen Z civic innovators by 2030.

After all, Gen Zers are the ones who will inherit the challenges we face today. They are also the ones who will need to address the challenges that have yet to emerge. We believe they are more than ready to start working on the solutions, disrupt entrenched power structures, and set empowering precedents for web3. In addition to focusing on Gen Z, we chose to launch the Dream DAO with firm roots in the Ethereum ecosystem because we strongly believe the healthy evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem is critical to the future of humanity and the planet.

Likewise, we believe the Ethereum ecosystem is the primary generator of regenerative web3 culture, projects, and leadership across the broader web3 ecosystem. Relatedly, one of our greatest supporters is Gitcoin, which is one of the most influential social impact-oriented DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem but also web3 at large. One thing we love about the leaders of the Ethereum ecosystem that we have gotten the opportunity to get to know well is that they are committed to bringing in more non-white, non-Western, non-male, and civic-minded builders into the space. This recognition that diversity is key to ensuring Ethereum’s sustainability and brighter future for us all has been very encouraging.

Finally, we consider web3’s ability to impact the world positively depends on the web3 builder community collectively looking a lot more like how the world looks and is more driven by social impact purpose. It is because of the aforementioned we consider Dream DAO will be a key driver in helping make this a reality.

Q: **How does your project differ from similar ones?***
*What other solutions are being worked on, and what alternatives do people currently rely on? Do you have unique expertise/perspective?*

Some similar ones are Builder DAO and otherwise similar communities for youth builders: TKS, Atlas, RISE, etc. With Builder DAO, there is no focus on social impact (plus it has shut down). The other communities focusing on youth builders and social impact, are selective in nature and require previous knowledge and expertise, and are often paid programs. Dream DAO is free and encourages passionate people who have little knowledge about web3 to apply and learn about the space, and it operates as a DAO. Furthermore, Dream DAO is focused on blockchain and web3 due to its potential to influence every single industry not only in a technical but also in an operational, hierarchal, and infrastructure way, and operating as a DAO is one way we show our commitment to this positive global transition.

**Requested amount***

A: USD 30,000

Q: **Proposed tasks, roadmap, and budget***
*Give us an itemized breakdown of how you'll be using the requested funds. Provide a brief timeline of the expected work and estimated budget. For each month or stage of work, list: main objectives, tasks that need to be completed to reach each objective, deliverables, and anticipated budget.*

July - Dec 2023

During the partnership, we would

#1: Have at least 2 meetups in an EF Ecosystem Event (15.000 USD: 10 members).

- As products of these meetups, Learning Artifacts will be created along with the other social media content, giving interesting insights into the Ethereum Ecosystem from a Gen Z perspective. These will then be shared with our internal community and external followers, helping support the onboarding of the next generation of Ethereum users.
- This amount will help us bring up to 10 people from various backgrounds and communities to attend Ethereum Conferences and Hackathons, giving our builders the chance to learn, network, and gain valuable skills to pursue their passions in the web3 space.

#2: 10.000 USD will be used to financially support our Builders participating in the Explorers Internship Program.

The Dream DAO Explorers Program is the flagship of our community. It cultivates and channels the talent of proven Gen Z civics leaders around the world to advance and evolve web3 and the public goods ecosystem. Each cycle we place 10-15 young builders in meaningful web3 organizations such as Celo, Climate Collective, LOA Labs, dOrg, and Protein for a two-month internship where they contribute to a socially impactful project. This season, we expect to place 15-20 builders, increasing our participation rates, and granting each of them 500-750 USD. 

This payment crucially allows interns the freedom to dedicate their time and energy to their host organisations without any financial burdens, allowing a level playing field and equal opportunities for young individuals to gain experience regardless of their background. It it important to note that
in the future all internships will aim to be paid by the host organisations (as we have made possible on occasions in DDEP cohort 2) but in this current web3 climate that has become increasingly difficult for our host organisations to manage. Therefore to ensure the future generation of web3 builders still get these vital experiences we believe that this stipend is crucial and a key way we can all invest in Human Capital. 

#3: Learning Resources and Bootcamp Program (5.000 USD)

- Dream DAO’s mission is to onboard GenZ into web3, no matter how experienced they are in space. That’s why each new cohort of builders takes part in a Bootcamp program for 5 weeks before joining the DAO as contributors. The Bootcamp is an intensive learning program that covers the basics of web3 and helps and mentors new builders to discover and identify their initial skills and interests in web3 x social impact, so they can better organize the pathway they wanna follow.
- Additionally, once new builders complete the Bootcamp, they also have a Study session about wallets, in which we guide them through the setting up process, send builders their first ETH so that they can get started with wallets, buy ENS domains, and navigate through the on-chain transactions system.
- This stipend will also support on-chain costs to give a free SkywalkerZ NFT to every builder, providing their voting power in determining the future of the DAO, and giving them an opportunity to participate in internships, hackathons, conferences, and study sessions.
- Another portion of these funds will be utilized to scale and maintain the Learning Together sessions, so we can invite amazing hosts while making the sessions open and available for the public, thus decentralizing the knowledge.

Q: **Is your project a public good? *If so, how?**

Dream DAO is a public good.

It's important to note that education — perhaps especially education focused on training public goods-builders — is one of the most important public goods.

“Education is a public good” means that there are positive externalities — not all of the benefits accrue to the students. Society benefits when more people get a high-quality education. Especially an education related to training young people to build tools, systems, and movements that serve the public good.

There are currently few to no educational providers focused on helping diverse 15-20-year-olds learn how to use web3 to do good in the world.

The fact that blockchains are immutable, transparent, and secure gives them the *potential* to help increase accountability in situations vulnerable to exploitation, create systems more resistant to fraud and censorship, and support those who are poorly served by traditional financial systems.

In addition to being a tool that enables the building of more just systems, blockchain can be a tool that helps us address the coordination problems that lie at the root of most of humanity's greatest challenges like climate change, global poverty, and erosion of democracy.

As the CEO of [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/), Kevin Owocki likes to say: “Coordination failures are often why we can’t have nice things because they are rampant in many systems around the world.”

Web3 — and especially the Ethereum ecosystem — is crucial to building a brighter future for humanity. It's mind-blowing to think about what will happen if we train thousands of civic innovators who will leverage their power to do good.

Members of the Dream DAO will go on to build world-changing DAOs, create web3 x social impact projects that make unprecedented progress on entrenched social issues, and become moral and tech-savvy leaders of their respective industries. We owe it to our progeny to leave the world better than we found it. A web3 native institution that produces web3-powered civic superheroes is a public good if we've ever seen one.

Q: **Is your project open source? *If not, why not?**

We are not a software company, but we still embody the spirit of open source. Everything we do, we build in public and are a huge proponent of public documentation.

Q: **What are your plans after the grant is completed?*
How do you aim to be sustainable after the grant? Alternatively, tell us why this project doesn't need to be sustainable!**

We will become sustainable after S4 from a combination of Ethereum NFT sales and charitable grant revenue.

Our 2 last rounds of NFT sales raised over $150,000. We plan to release more at the end of seasons 3 and 4, which will raise more money to fund the Dream DAO.

We are already getting a good amount of inbound from potential sponsors/funders of Dream DAO, but expect that it will pick up a lot once there are even more testimonials from prominent web3 organizations about just how valuable our Dream DAO Builders are to web3 organizations and to the web3 x social impact ecosystem at large. We’re already starting to see this in action as some of our original S1 and S2 builder interns have continued to work at their interning organizations, showing the DAO’s value in bringing emerging Gen Z talent into the Ethereum ecosystem.

Q: **If you didn't work on this project, what would you work on instead?***

@PlantBoi 

If not working actively at Dream DAO, our core DAO members would continue to solve global-civic problems both within and outside of the web3 space. For example, alongside our Gen Z builders running Dream DAO operations through our recurring roles and decentralized governance, they are also actively working in projects including dOrg, Atlantis, Climate Collective, and Celo. Whilst our Champions are active in projects from Protocol Labs, Protein, and Gitcoin to Giveth and AllForClimate. 

Q: **Have you previously applied to ESP with this same idea or project?***

Yes

Q: **Has anything changed? If you're considering reapplying, we recommend signing up for Office Hours first before restarting the application process.**
Nothing major has changed with our mission at Dream DAO since our first application, but we’re now seeking additional financial support to allow us to continue onboarding the next generation of young innovators into the Ethereum ecosystem. We hope that the impact we’ve achieved using EF’s initial grant support shows the value that we can continue to provide if given an additional follow-up grant.

Q: **If you've applied previously with the same idea, how much progress have you made since the last time you applied?***

Dream DAO has launched 2 more seasons since its last application, now continuing with Season 3, which launched on January 2023., some quick stats on what’s been achieved so far during these 3 seasons are:

- Dream DAO has raised over 250K USD with grants and SkywalkerZ sales since its Kickoff.
- We have onboarded 167 voting members, 109 builders, and 58 champions since its kickoff.
- We have raised over 4500+ followers on Twitter.
- More than 80 Learning Together sessions were hosted (conversational lectures), including sessions hosted by EF Leaders and about the Ethereum Ecosystem. Some LTs, you can check:
