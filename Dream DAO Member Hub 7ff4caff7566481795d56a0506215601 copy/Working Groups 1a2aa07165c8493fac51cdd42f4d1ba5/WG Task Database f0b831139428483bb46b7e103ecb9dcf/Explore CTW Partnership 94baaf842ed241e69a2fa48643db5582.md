OR 

-Education element

Around April 25th-May 9th

2. Offering an educational partnership by allowing Dream DAO to host a module on W3 Learn Academy which aligns with your Gen Z-focused learning goals and provides exclusive limited access. 

Perfect. Can go many directions, producing learning artifacts after learning journeys. (we could also work together for something around the next bootcamp)

3. Co-organizing an exclusive in-person event catering to your audience or hosting our fellows at one of your exclusive events.

-Potential Edcon event

OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR SYNERGY 
-Learning Together collab - Come onto host a LT session on a topic of interest. 
E.g. the importance of diversity in a community, and how to promote and overcome challenges that arise within a diverse community.
 E.g. Onboarding into web3  (we can also use it as a way to bring back inactive builders/champs)

-Explorers program intern?

- by the end of the season could request some sort of w3academy access for DD community
