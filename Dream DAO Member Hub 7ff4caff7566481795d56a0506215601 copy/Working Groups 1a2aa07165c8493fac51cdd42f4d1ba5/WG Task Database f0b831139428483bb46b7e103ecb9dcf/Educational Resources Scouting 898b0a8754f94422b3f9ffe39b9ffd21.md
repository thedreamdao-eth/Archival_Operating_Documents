# Educational Resources Scouting

Deadline: April 27, 2023
Peeps: Keshav, Valeria Zambrano, Aayush Pursnani, Aaryan Chadha
Season: S3
Status: Done
WG: Grants

- [x]  Form small groups of 'scouts' to look for the most valuable resources, e.g. a paid consensys dev course
- [ ]  [https://university.alchemy.com/home](https://university.alchemy.com/home)

[https://courses.consensys.net/courses/blockchain-essentials-an-introduction-to-blockchain](https://courses.consensys.net/courses/blockchain-essentials-an-introduction-to-blockchain)

- [ ]  Builders who scout then write up messages to these orgs, tailored to the specific requests we have, asking if they want to support the DAO with free access to them + giving some background
- [ ]  We as a community check the messages here, then send them off either from Amanda's email, the DD Twitter or the orgs website contact form (Twitter is often great as our following gives us credibility)
- [ ]  Keep track of responses (leaving **@amanda maritan** email address for them to return message to) and feedback here about offerings. Some may request some highlighting of a partnership etc in return for resources, so we can discuss here situations to just make sure it's 'worth' the trade.

Please DO NOT reach out to any of these orgs yet! 

**Obs:** in ‘’message/outreach proposal’’, please write up messages that Amanda and Co-Stewards can send to these orgs, tailored to the specific requests we have, asking if they want to support the DAO with free access to them + giving some background; consider creating a template
