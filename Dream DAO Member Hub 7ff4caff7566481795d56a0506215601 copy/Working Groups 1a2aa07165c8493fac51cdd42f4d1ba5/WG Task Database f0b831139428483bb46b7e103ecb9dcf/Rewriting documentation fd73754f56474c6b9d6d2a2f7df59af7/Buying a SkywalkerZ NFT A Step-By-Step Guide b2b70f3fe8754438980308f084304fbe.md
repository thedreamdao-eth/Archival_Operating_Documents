# 1A. BUY FROM THE MINTING SITE

<aside>
‚ÑπÔ∏è [***THIS](https://getskywalkerz.com) IS THE LINK TO THE MINTING SITE.***

If you already have an Ethereum wallet and have as much Ethereum as you need to mint the number of SkywalkerZ you plan to mint, skip to [step 5](https://www.notion.so/bb007d8225494a80ad5dd16e33bc98eb?pvs=21).

**Steps 1-12 should only take around one hour if the Ethereum network is busy (transfers can take a while sometimes).**

1. **Turn your Fiat ($,¬£,‚Ç¨, etc.) into Ethereum (Cryptocurrency). For most of you the easiest way to do that will be via¬†[COINBASE](http://www.coinbase.com/).**

2. **Once you‚Äôve setup a Coinbase account, purchase some Ethereum** (If you're buying one  SkywalkerZ, you‚Äôll probably want to buy around **0.16 Ethereum**‚Äîto cover the 0.1 ETH cost of the SkywalkerZ and the gas fees required to transfer your Ethereum to your Ethereum wallet like MetaMask and mint the NFT. You will likely have Ethereum left over if you buy at a non-peak time.)
