Wondering if there might be merit to trying to do outreach to Binance about trying to run a service for bringing new younger people into web3...? If we could create a proposal of what we can offer them in the way of a service to bring people into web3, e.g. teach them web3 basics, provide a safe space to grow with other young members, get sponsorship to run internships, run trips to conferences etc.
