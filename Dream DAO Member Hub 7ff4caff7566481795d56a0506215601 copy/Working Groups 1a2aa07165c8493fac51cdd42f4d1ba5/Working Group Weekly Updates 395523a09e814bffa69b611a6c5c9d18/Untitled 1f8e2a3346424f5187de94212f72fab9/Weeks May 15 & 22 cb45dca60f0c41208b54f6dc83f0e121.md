# Weeks May 15 & 22

Working Group: Grants
Updates: 1. We are waiting for Ethereum Foundation to send us office hours availability so they can check our application before sending it through (this was their recommendation because we had applied for a grant in the past);
2. Cartesi reached out about their Community Grants Program, we are now drafting a proposal (more details TBA soon);
3. Crypto Tech Women were chatting with us about a possible partnership, however, after one of my follow-ups they didn’t get back to us yet, so still waiting for it;
4. Artizen Fund is still happening, the first phase closes next month, so that’s when we will be able to find out if we are going to the second phase or not;
5. Co-stewards, Ibtehaj, and Amanda are working hard to get DDEP hosts, if you know any potential hosts, please add them here (https://www.notion.so/eab86b93611a4512bbe68f7973d11607?pvs=21) so we can get in touch! https://ddephost.paperform.co/
