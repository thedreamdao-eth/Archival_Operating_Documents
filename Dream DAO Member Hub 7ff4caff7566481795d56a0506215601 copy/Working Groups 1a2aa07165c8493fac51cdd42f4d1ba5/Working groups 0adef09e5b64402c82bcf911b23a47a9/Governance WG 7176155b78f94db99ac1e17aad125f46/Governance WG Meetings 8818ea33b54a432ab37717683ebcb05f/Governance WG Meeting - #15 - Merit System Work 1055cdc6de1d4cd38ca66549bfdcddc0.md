### *Icebreaker*

**Prompt: From your own leadership experience, how would you reward outperforming workers / members in a way that can encourage participation of less active ones?**

- Aditya: I wish I had enough leadership experience to answer this question.
- Madison: Reward them but also really encourage others who aren‚Äôt as active
- David: Positive reinforcement and education on how to lead and engage others
- Jae-Hee: I would bake them cookies. And seek to bring others in!
- Shaan: IRL activities or gifts like books or dinner!
