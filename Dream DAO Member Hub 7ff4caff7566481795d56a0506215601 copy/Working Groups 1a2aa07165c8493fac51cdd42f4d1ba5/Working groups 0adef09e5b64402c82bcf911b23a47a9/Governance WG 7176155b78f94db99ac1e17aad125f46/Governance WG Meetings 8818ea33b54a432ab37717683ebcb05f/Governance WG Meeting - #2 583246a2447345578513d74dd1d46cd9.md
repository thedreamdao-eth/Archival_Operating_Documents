### Contents

- Updates: Snapshot + Tooling research (10-15 mins)
- **Jam on Governance Design Questions! (~30 mins)**
- [*If we have time*] Brainstorm on the Merit-based Voting System

## Updates

1. What are your thoughts on Snapshot? What issues have you encountered? 
    - Stam: It’s great. We finally feel like more of a DAO
    - Gary: Shoutout to Shaan, Stam, and Cerv (for the template)
    - Carl: How can we make the proposals more useful (if every vote is unanimous, it’s not that helpful beyond a record of decisions)
        - Stam: However, the early proposals are momentum building/creators of stability
        - Gary: Merit-based voting system is a decision path not obvious where voting would help decide what to do.
    - Cerv - Suggested todo: how to do X
        1. Providing useful how-tos for anyone even outside of Dream DAO
        2. Documentation needed for members
        3. Might be a good forcing function for everyone to improve their processes based on collective intelligence
        
2. Tooling research is a great way to get involved in our WG’s workflow
    - Check out the doc by prof to see the research framework
    [DAO Tooling Research Hub](../../../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/DAO%20Tooling%20Research%20Hub%20fc68febaf2c442faad99e78e36a2d937.md)

    - Stam: IRL, he does business + tech consulting. When companies have a use case to fill, he has a whole process that he uses to identify new tech to buy or build.
        - not going to be a single tool that does everything we need to do
        - map out every need we have, and then plug in tools from there
    - Gary: Do we have any needs that aren’t listed?
    - Carl:

    - Gary: **Urgency of filling certain needs**
        - make it easy for ANYONE to propose a tool to run an experiment using
            - for example, Prof Stam wants us to pilot Koop, which has a cool bounty system.
    - Madison created this w/ Stam: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r0Cbj68_DRuuAbLTSOxpLYGR71SgiTQed385v_CTJ7w/edit#slide=id.g10dd909ccd1_0_0](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r0Cbj68_DRuuAbLTSOxpLYGR71SgiTQed385v_CTJ7w/edit#slide=id.g10dd909ccd1_0_0)
    
    - Any great tooling ideas for our WG to research?
