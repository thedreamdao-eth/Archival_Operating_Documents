It is the time to think through what our WG will be occupied with in S3. As this is already 

WG Can work on: 

***Projects:***

- **Building Dream DAO Grants for builders**
This seems to be the only step left to completing the vision that was expressed in our roadmap. It is crucial to deliver what we promised to the DAO, but as we are currently in the bear market it might also be reasonable to put this aside until better times come.
The vision in Dreampapers:
- **Keep the conversation on the** **Merit System ⇒ Merit Voting System - controversial**
It would be very good to lay the foundation of transitioning into the voting merit system through discussion and start searching for ways to do this by around S4.
    - *Might be a very big project*

***Activities:***

- **Taking on the Membership Renewal process.**
- **Further voting system solutions**
It is key that we keep seeking a more web3-native, automated solution for our seasonal elections.
- More ideas welcome!
