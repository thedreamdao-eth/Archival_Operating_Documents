        ‚Üí Develop detailed documentation on governance
        ‚Üí Identify tools for Governance
    ‚Üí Run first election(s)
    ‚ÜíDefine the role of treasury and dispersement 
    
       
    
    ***IMPORTANT: as a management-oriented group, we have to first define key areas of our work (what ‚Äúgovernance structure‚Äù entails?** - like treasury, voting, other aspects**), so let‚Äôs try to brainstorm on that first!***
    
    **Notes:** (Madison)                                                                                                               
    
    - **Tim**: maybe divide Governance structure into areas: community management, voting, treasury*,* and minor areas
        - **Gary**: There will be subgroups within this governance committee, but they will emerge overtime and we do not have to necessarily design them from the start.
    - **David**: What are the main goals of governance? Is treasury a part of that?
        - We should define governance for the DAO
    - **Carl**: We should be throwing out ideas
    - **Chabu**: What are the other committees doing?
        - The structure of the leadership and merit
    - **Gary**: We can call this committee governance and treasury
    - **Nathan**: Likes the idea of quadratic voting
    - **Gary**: We should figure out interim governance processes.
    - **Carl**: We need a process for reviewing proposals
    - **David**: We need to move from centralization ‚Üí decentralization. As for now, Gary needs to have conversations about decisions.
    - **Chabu**: We can map out milestones in decentralizing
        - **David**: By the end of phase 1 we could have a committee process, and then have a DAO-wide process
    - **Gary**: How do we have something like a steering committee in a web3 way?
    - **Carl**: What are some of the things Gary is doing alone right now?
        - Creating Discord channels and access
        - What meetings need to be had
        - Setting up working groups
        - Tooling
        - Tracking contributions
            - This could be for governance- because we are tying contributions/merit to voting
    - **Gary**: Do we want merit badges?
        - **David**: Could badges tie to non-transferable tokens?
        - **Gary**: I am not aware of a system that makes it possible to do that- we could do the voting somewhere else and track it in Notion
    - **Tim/Gary**: We are not using a token-based voting system
    - **Shaan**: Aragon could be useful
    
- **Brainstorm what needs to be done to achieve the key results + volunteers:**
    
    **Notes: (Madison, Gary)**
    
    - **TO REVIEW AT NEXT MEETING:** Create a document that describes the interim governance structure (including how governance wg functions)
    
    - Create working group governance structure (documentation)
        - **For binary votes:** Simple majority, closed vote/anonymous voting
        - **For multiple choices:** Rank Choice Voting
        - For every topic, there will be sub-groups that bring questions to the broader group to discuss
    - Identify discussion topics and their order
        - Interim DAO-wide governance structure, voting + merit system, longer term governance structure, rules and practices, DAO tooling, elections, proposals, etc
    - After each discussion, create detailed documentation for each area of governance
