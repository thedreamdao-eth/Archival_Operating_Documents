## **The Use of GWG in Season 3**

**The main part of our todayâ€™s meeting!** 

***Projects:***

- 1) A better election system for Season 4
    - What should the election system be like?
        - Anonymous voting is a must
        - Voting systems
        - The results of the election should be easily verifiable by the members of the DAO
        - The whole process should be transparent and resistant to tampering
        - A web3 native solution will be ideal
    - Improve processes and documentation for holding elections.
        - How to setup Elections
        - Creating a more transparent Election Committee
        - Guidelines around campaigning
    - Do we need elections for Recurring Roles?
- 2) Even more financial transparency and decentralization
    
    **Most of the following ideas have already been implemented/will be implemented soon.**
    
    - Financial compensation of Co-stewards, Leads, and Recurring roles
        - All the monthly requests made should be easily accessible to the members of the DAO
        - We can have a database (on Notion itself) that tracks all the money paid from the DAO treasury as stipends/bounties
    - Multi-sig
        
        **After discussing with the co-stewards, I have realized that this might not be a feasible idea.** 
        
        - To increase the decentralization and autonomy of the DAO, we need to ensure that no one person has de-facto control of the treasury.
        - Should the DAO Council be able to approve the disbursement of funds from the Treasury?
- 3) Exploring how Tech can be used to streamline DAO operations
    - Discord Bot
        - Find out if an in-house bot would be useful and feasible for the DAO
    - Automating (the tedious parts of) recurring roles
        - We might look into automating POAP distribution
    - Nutshell
        - See if tools like nutshell should be integrated into our longer-form documents and explainers.
- 4) Achieve consensus on some long-standing questions
    - DAO membership
        - Will need to coordinate with other WGs
        - We will need to have discussions about inactive members and if we need to come up with a system for offboarding them.
    - 
- 5) Improve the Voting processes and increase activity
    - Ensure that at least 11 members vote
    - Define different stages
    Currently: braindump â†’ feedback â†’ vote 
    Do we need any additional steps depending on support/criticism of proposals? e.g. â€˜re-workingâ€™ stage
    - Redefine the Snapshot Voting process to account for incorporating feedback and minimize - Research other DAOs/web3 orgs for inspiration
- 6) Improve and document the Application process

***Activities:***
