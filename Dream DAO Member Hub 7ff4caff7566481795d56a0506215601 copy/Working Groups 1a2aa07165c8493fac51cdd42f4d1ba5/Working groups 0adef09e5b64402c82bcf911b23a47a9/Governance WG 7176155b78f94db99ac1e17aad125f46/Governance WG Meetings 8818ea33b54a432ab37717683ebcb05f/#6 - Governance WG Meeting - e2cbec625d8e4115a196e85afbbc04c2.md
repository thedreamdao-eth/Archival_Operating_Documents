- S4 Applications (preliminary feedback)
    - Problems
        - The whole process of evaluating applicants was haphazard.
            - Members were scrambling to meet the deadline.
            - There were last-minute changes to the evaluation rubric.
        - The current process isnâ€™t scalable.
            - If the current trend (of the number of applicants) continues, we might have to evaluate well over a hundred applicants!
        - The current process isnâ€™t fair enough.
            - Since any member can evaluate any applicant, it makes the whole process too subjective.
            - This also might introduce potential conflicts of interest.
    - Tasks
        - Go through the existing Rubric and identify ways to make it more fair and objective.
        -Multiple reviews of each candidate
            
            -Random assignment of candidates to reviewers
            -Clear evaluation guidelines 
            Past rubric example [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gLWo0j6i2t8at158So8CwYBYG1TeVCypnr08jMX9PFA/edit)
            
        - Review the existing Application Questions.
        - Decide compensation for reviewers
        - Consult with Builders who were a part of the process in the last Season.
        - Come up with a process to select an Applications review committee.
