Phase: Phase 2

üå±**GM! Glad you joined the session!** 

### *Icebreaker*

**Prompt: What was your overall experience with the Election Process in Phase 1?**

- 
- David: I didn‚Äôt feel like I could get to understand candidates that I didn‚Äôt already know.
- Carl: the open voting made it feel like a popularity contest
- Madhav: I guess okaish
- Saf: Would have liked to know new season builders better as a co-steward candidate; for WG leads, being unsuccessful in the elections made a lot of Builders lose interest in the DAO

- Madison: Made me lose a lot of sleep and a bit of sanity üò≥
    - hats off to Madison for the amazing work!
        - +1
        - +1

## S3 Elections

**The main part of our today‚Äôs meeting! 

What do we need to [hold a drama-free election](../../../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Working%20Groups%20Home%20Season%201%204d1702104a2f4180a27e92b0510bd283/Dream%20DAO%20Phase%201%20Working%20Groups%20c53752864e064f6da1b9f1c4ed1019ba/Governance%20WG%20%5BLegacy%5D%20a464f56462524c87842951a5c5d8b9f0/Governance%20WG%20in%20Season%202%207538a4c8c3a8416cba1924d3b0457068.md)?
1. Clear instructions for the next election person, a doc consisting of:
-** How to set up WG Lead Voting
- How to set up Persistent Roles Voting
- Possible issues + how to resolve them
- Guidelines around 1:1 campaigning
*- anything else?*

**2. Token-gated voting tools that allow for anonymous voting**

- Vocdoni - no response from the team, not sure if it‚Äôs ready yet.
**BUT: there was a big update on Oct 20, which supposedly added the anonymous voting function**
