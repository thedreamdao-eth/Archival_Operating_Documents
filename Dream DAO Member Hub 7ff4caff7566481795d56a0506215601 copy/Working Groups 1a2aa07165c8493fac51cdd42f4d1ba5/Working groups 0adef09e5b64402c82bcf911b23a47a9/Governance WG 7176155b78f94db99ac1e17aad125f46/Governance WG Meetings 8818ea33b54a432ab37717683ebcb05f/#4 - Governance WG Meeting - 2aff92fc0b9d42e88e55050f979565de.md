## OKR 1

## Improve the Voting processes and increase turnout

### Ensure quorum

- We were unable to reach the quorum in [Proposal #68](https://snapshot.org/#/thedreamdao.eth/proposal/0x025242dee2bc54fc9f8ba04eb9b725f4d37679e0059b334a47f2fb8b1c38a3ee).
    - The proposal had wide consensus (all 10 members voted yes to the proposal).
    - We had to put it up for a vote again, and it passed 17:1:2 (For : Against : Abstain).
- Reaching the quorum is essential.
    - We cannot implement a proposal if enough people don‚Äôt vote on it (even if the proposal has a wide consensus).
    - If a well-thought-out proposal (that enjoys wide consensus) fails to pass due to a lack of quorum, then DAO operations might get affected by the delay.
        - Imagine if an important proposal (like change in the election system) doesn‚Äôt pass on time because of a lack of quorum.
- The current quorum is 11.
    - Does this need to be changed?
- Reaching the quorum might not be an issue once S3 builders are able to vote.
    - However, this issue is a symptom of a deeper problem.
        - Members of the DAO should be able to spare a couple of minutes a week to go through the proposals and vote on them.
        - Should there be more incentives for people to vote?
            - We already have POAPs and merit badges.
                - But only very few members mint them.
- Shutter voting makes it hard to know how many people have voted while the election is still ongoing.
    - This means we might not be able to know if the proposal will reach the quorum before the voting ends.

### Refine the process

- Current process
    - Proposal submitted to Agreements Coordinator (Anytime during the week)
    - Submission(s) sent out for feedback (Monday)
    - Time for Feedback: (Monday to Thursday)
    - Proposal(s) sent to voting (Friday)
    - Time for voting (Friday to Sunday)
- Problems
    - There is no ‚Äòre-working‚Äô phase
        - There is no mechanism for incorporating feedback into the proposal, especially if the feedback is substantial.
        - If the community gives substantial feedback on the proposal, the proposers only have two choices:
            - Continue with the original proposal. This forces them to ignore valuable suggestions and criticisms
            - Decide not to go forward with the proposal. This leaves the proposal in an uncomfortable limbo.
- Solutions
    - We can research other DAOs/web3 organizations for inspiration

- Previous Discussion (GWG #2)
    - [First part of the OKR]
        - David: Are other votes getting over the Quorum?
            - Aditya: DAO-wide proposals barely achieve quorum if we don‚Äôt repeatedly ask people to vote.
        - David: People are disinterested in voting.
            - We should have a Discord conversation about this. We need to remind people why voting is important.
            - Shaan: We need to give S3 builders SkyWalkerZ to allow them to vote.
        - Aditya: The problem will be solved after S3 builders get to vote. But this is a symptom of a larger problem (inactivity is increasing amongst DAO members).
            - David: This inactivity could also be caused because there haven‚Äôt been many proposals lately. Also, the last few proposals were between Seasons (which might have led to fewer voters as more members temporarily unplugged from the DAO).
            
            We should just send out a few messages to remind people that the new Season has started and why they should vote before changing the process.
    - [Second part of the OKR]
        - David: What if we shift the voting time to Monday too? Every Monday, new proposals are sent out for comments, and older ones are sent out for vote (or are announced to be abandoned). The deadline for comments is still Thursday. Over the weekend, proposers can decide if they amend their proposal and if they want to go forward with it al all.  This also ensures that people who unplug during the weekend also get to vote.
            - Aditya: This is a pretty interesting idea!
- Previous Discussion (GWG #3)
    - Harry: The S3 builders should have SkyWalkerZ by the end of the month.
    But I am unsure how we can ensure that S3 builders have a voice in decisions/proposals that are voted on before the mint.
        - Aditya: I don‚Äôt think we have thought about this in past seasons.
        - Harry: This might not be a big issue if no important proposal is due before the 24th. But there is a chance that the proposal on conferences will be put up for a vote before the mint.
            - Aditya: Yeah, I don‚Äôt know if this will be an issue. But assuming it is, can we use an alternative voting mechanism?
                - David: There are no proposals up as of now. But if there is a need, we could use a paperform like solution.
                - Harry: Right now, Gatherings is scouting for potential conferences, and there is a chance that the final choice goes out for a vote if a consensus is not achieved. I will convey this issue to Gatherings, and most probably, we won‚Äôt need a vote.
    - Gabriela: To increase turnover, can we have ‚Äúa reminder to vote‚Äù event in Google Calendar?
        - Harry: We are already sending a lot of emails every week to DAO members. Hence I would caution against cluttering up their inboxes even more.
        - David: We can encourage people to do this individually in our emails if that's what they want to do. Also, bunching up emails so they get sent out every Monday will help with the email clutter.
            - Aditya: Yeah, that‚Äôs a decent middle ground. The Google Calendar event should be optional and not the default. And the new proposed weekly timeline will certainly reduce the email clutter.
    - Aditya: In the last discussion, we also talked about DAO members being disinterested in voting. What can we do about that?
        - Harry: If we end up modifying the current process, then we will have to send a general email informing everyone about the changes. Then, we can have a small section in that email talking about why voting is important.
        - David: We should also add a one/two-liner in every voting-related email that says why voting is important.
            - Aditya: Like the Learning Together emails, we should include a summary of the proposals in the email itself. Maybe we can ask the proposers to include such a summary when they submit the proposal to the DAO Agreements Coordinator (Adarsh).

## OKR 2

## Achieve consensus on some long-standing question(s)

### DAO membership

- This has been a long-standing issue that we might want to take on this Season.
- We will need to have discussions about inactive members and if we need to come up with a system for offboarding them.
- We can look at other DAOs/web3 organizations for inspiration.
- Since this will impact every member of the DAO, we might need to consult with people outside the Working Group.
- 

### Exploring how Tech can be used to streamline DAO operations

- Discord Bot
    - Find out if an in-house bot would be useful and feasible for the DAO
- Automating (the tedious parts of) recurring roles
    - We might look into automating the POAP distribution
- Nutshell
    - See if tools like nutshell should be integrated into our longer-form documents and explainers.
    - I‚Äôll add a proper Nutshell Demo here soon, but for now, feel free to try it out [here](https://ncase.me/nutshell/).
- Previous Discussion (GWG #2)
    - Aditya: [Described the OKR]
    - David: There are a lot of interesting discussions to be had here.
        - How big should the DAO be?
        - Should we deboard inactive users or just let them be?
        
        This might interact with our SkyWalkerZ system.
        
- Previous Discussion (GWG #3)
    - Gabriela: Maybe instead of offboarding people, we can just internally classify members as active and inactive. Also, what exactly do you mean by offboarding?
        - Aditya: That‚Äôs a pretty interesting idea. We can use a lot of proxies (like merit badges and attendance in LTs and WG Meetings) to assess if a member is active or not.
        We haven‚Äôt defined what might constitute offboarding.
    - David: Previous discussions never really reached a conclusion. But we should remember that inactivity doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean disinterest. Just because someone doesn‚Äôt vote doesn‚Äôt mean we should strip them of their voting rights. We should look into how other web3 organisations handle this.
        - Harry: This varies widely from org to org. Some organisations are very aggressive with membership, but I don‚Äôt think that is something we want for Dream DAO. Also, revoking access from certain privileges can be very hard, especially if they are tied to SkyWalkerZ.
        
        The current Membership renewal process relies on self-reporting and can only be used to refine mailing lists and such.
    - Eunice: We should also promote the culture of unplugging.
    - [Hard to transcribe/summarize discussion about the OKR]: 35:45 to 45:40]
    - [Note from future Aditya: While writing these meeting notes, I have realized that OKR 2 need significant rework and rewriting to ensure that we can have useful conversations about it. Hence I will rewrite it.]

## Discussion:

- Aditya:
    - After talking to the Agreements Coordinator (Adarsh), it seems that the current process has its roots in an old Braindump by Gary. The process also falls under the purview of Agreement #11. Hence, to amend it, a new proposal should be created and then accepted by the DAO. I will coordinate with Adarsh to create that proposal.
    - OKR 2 need significant rework and rewriting to ensure that we can have useful conversations about it. Hence I will rewrite it before the next meeting.
    - OKR 3 and OKR 4 will only be useful near the Season‚Äôs end. Hence, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to talk about them in today‚Äôs meeting. So, let‚Äôs talk about Activity 1!
