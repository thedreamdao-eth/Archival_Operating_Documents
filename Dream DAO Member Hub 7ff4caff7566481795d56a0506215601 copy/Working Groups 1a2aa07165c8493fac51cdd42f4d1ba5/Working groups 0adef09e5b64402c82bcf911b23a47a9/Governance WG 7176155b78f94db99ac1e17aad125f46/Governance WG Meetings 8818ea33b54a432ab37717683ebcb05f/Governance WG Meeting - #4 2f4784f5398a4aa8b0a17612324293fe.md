## Updates

- Process of integrating feedback
    - There are a lot of new ideas and proposals for an additional process that shouldnâ€™t be integrated through the centralized process - aka through one person. How would we like to proceed?

- Ideas
    - If itâ€™s fundamental it can go into the design doc or as the â€˜ownerâ€™ of the doc - Chabu can implement a few ideas
    - Create a document that lists what comments were resolved, how, and why.
    - Work with WG leaders to discuss certain design choices and questions
    - Let people vote up whether something needs to be discussed or determine what can be resolved individually
    - Create a response/options for every question and then allow people to up vote what should be a discussion. The follow up question process can take place on discord.
- Async decision making qualities
    - examples: policy impact, requires funds/resources, community impact
    - Key Questions: 
    **Jam on Governance Design Questions: The the election process of working group leaders (~10 mins)**
- People submit a statement on why they are running (include statement guidance)
    - per wg have a champion and a builder

Do we need an extra procedure for requesting that a WG craft a solution around a specific task? Or do we stick to a simple message in a Discord channel? (I guess the latter one is definitely quicker and less complicated, right?)

- Who needs to vote on a proposal? What is the minimum rate of participation?

**Next steps:**

- Chabu - Formalize election process
- Madhav - Solidify the ranked choice voting process
- Angelina - Create threads for discussing Structure Choices
- Tim and Karl - Put the inputs in those threads in a doc
