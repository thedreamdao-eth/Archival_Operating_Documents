# OKRs

## 1. Improve the Voting processes and increase turnout

### Ensure quorum

- We were unable to reach the quorum in [Proposal #68](https://snapshot.org/#/thedreamdao.eth/proposal/0x025242dee2bc54fc9f8ba04eb9b725f4d37679e0059b334a47f2fb8b1c38a3ee).
    - The proposal had wide consensus (all 10 members voted yes to the proposal).
    - We had to put it up for a vote again, and it passed 17:1:2 (For : Against : Abstain).
- Reaching the quorum is essential.
    - We cannot implement a proposal if enough people don’t vote on it (even if the proposal has a wide consensus).
    - If a well-thought-out proposal (that enjoys wide consensus) fails to pass due to a lack of quorum, then DAO operations might get affected by the delay.
        - Imagine if an important proposal (like change in the election system) doesn’t pass on time because of a lack of quorum.
- The current quorum is 11.
    - Does this need to be changed?
- Reaching the quorum might not be an issue once S3 builders are able to vote.
    - However, this issue is a symptom of a deeper problem.
        - Members of the DAO should be able to spare a couple of minutes a week to go through the proposals and vote on them.
        - Should there be more incentives for people to vote?
            - We already have POAPs and merit badges.
                - But only very few members mint them.
- Shutter voting makes it hard to know how many people have voted while the election is still ongoing.
    - This means we might not be able to know if the proposal will reach the quorum before the voting ends.

### Refine the process

- Current process
    - Proposal submitted to Agreements Coordinator (Anytime during the week)
    - Submission(s) sent out for feedback (Monday)
    - Time for Feedback: (Monday to Thursday)
    - Proposal(s) sent to voting (Friday)
    - Time for voting (Friday to Sunday)
- Problems
    - There is no ‘re-working’ phase
        - There is no mechanism for incorporating feedback into the proposal, especially if the feedback is substantial.
        - If the community gives substantial feedback on the proposal, the proposers only have two choices:
            - Continue with the original proposal. This forces them to ignore valuable suggestions and criticisms
            - Decide not to go forward with the proposal. This leaves the proposal in an uncomfortable limbo.
- Solutions
    - We can research other DAOs/web3 organizations for inspiration
    - 

## 2. Achieve consensus on some long-standing question(s)

### DAO membership

- This has been a long-standing issue that we might want to take on this Season.
- We will need to have discussions about inactive members and if we need to come up with a system for offboarding them.
- We can look at other DAOs/web3 organizations for inspiration.
- Since this will impact every member of the DAO, we might need to consult with people outside the Working Group.
- 

## 3. A better election system for Season 4

### Election system requirements

- Anonymous voting is a must.
- The results of the election should be easily verifiable by the members of the DAO.
- The whole process should be transparent and resistant to tampering.
- A web3 native solution will be ideal.

Currently, no system that satisfies all these criteria exists. We might have to relax some of these requirements or go for an in-house solution. 

### Improve processes and documentation for holding elections.

- Proper documentation on how to setup Elections
- Creating a more transparent Election Committee
- Guidelines around campaigning
- Learn from past experiences

## 4. Improve and document the Application process

### Problems

- The whole process of evaluating applicants was haphazard.
    - Members were scrambling to meet the deadline.
    - There were last-minute changes to the evaluation rubric.
- The current process isn’t scalable.
    - If the current trend (of the number of applicants) continues, we might have to evaluate well over a hundred applicants!
- The current process isn’t fair enough.
    - Since any member can evaluate any applicant, it makes the whole process too subjective.
    - This also might introduce potential conflicts of interest.

### Solutions

- A committee of experienced builders and champions can be chosen to evaluate all applicants.
- Members of such a committee could be properly instructed on how to score applicants using a DAO-approved rubric.
- 

### Documentation

- Proper documentation on how to evaluate applicants
- Coming up with a system to form a transparent Application Committee
- Guidelines around evaluation
- Learn from past experiences
- 

## ***Activities:***

### Exploring how Tech can be used to streamline DAO operations

- Discord Bot
    - Find out if an in-house bot would be useful and feasible for the DAO
- Automating (the tedious parts of) recurring roles
    - We might look into automating the POAP distribution
- Nutshell
    - See if tools like nutshell should be integrated into our longer-form documents and explainers.
    - I’ll add a proper Nutshell Demo here soon, but for now, feel free to try it out [here](https://ncase.me/nutshell/).

### Facilitating the Membership Renewal process.
