# ðŸ‘€Â Election System Requirements

> In [#6 - Governance WG Meeting - ](../Governance%20WG%20Meetings%208818ea33b54a432ab37717683ebcb05f/#6%20-%20Governance%20WG%20Meeting%20-%20e2cbec625d8e4115a196e85afbbc04c2.md) the following requirements were reaffirmed for the Season 4 Election System:
> 
> - Security
>     - The election system should be able to guarantee a legitimate outcome even if there are malicious attempts by people to manipulate the election.
> - Anonymity
>     - The votes cast must be anonymous. No one should be able to find out who a member voted for. This should be the case both during and after the election.
> - Transparency
>     - Any member of the DAO should be able to verify the results of the election easily without having to trust any committee or member blindly.
> - Web3
>     - An on-chain solution that utilizes SkywalkerZ NFTs to token-gate the process would be ideal.
> 
> Besides all these requirements, casting a vote should be simple without a high technical barrier. The Election system should also allow the DAO to use ranked-choice voting.

# ðŸ’­Â Backup Solution

> This document describes a fallback web2 solution that the Election Committee (EC) may use if the primary web3 solution (Vocdoni at the time of writing) is not viable for a particular election.

# ðŸ›«Â Anonymously Authenticated Form + Python3

> This solution has been adapted from the system used in S3 elections after incorporating the lessons learned. 

A typical election conducted using this solution looks like this:
> 
> - Creation of the ULT (UVC Lookup Table)
>     - A single core member of the EC, preferably the Builder Election Commissioner (BEC), creates an Excel sheet that contains the names and email addresses of all eligible voting members.
>     - Then, the BEC generates UVCs (Unique Voting Codes)
>         - UVCs are one-time-use passcodes that will be used by voters to prove their identity.
>         - These UVCs can be generated by using a website like [https://www.random.org/integers/](https://www.random.org/integers/)
>             - For this particular website, the recommended settings are as shown

>             
>         - UVCs must be at least 6 digits long
>     - After copying the numbers generated, one is assigned to each member in the ULT.
> - Distribution of UVCs
>     - The ULT is used as a mailing list to send personalised emails to each member that contain their assigned UVC.
>     - This can be accomplished by using Microsoft Wordâ€™s Mailmerge
> - Creation of the Voting Form
>     - A Google Form is created for the voting
>     - The form only has a UVC field to identify voters
> - Voting
>     
>     The Voting Form and UVCs are sent out to the members
>     
> - Result Calculation
>     - The Form data is exported in the form of a CSV file
>     - A Python3 programme is used to calculate the result
>         - [https://github.com/Lewis-Base/Dream-DAO/tree/main/S3-Elections](https://github.com/Lewis-Base/Dream-DAO/tree/main/S3-Elections) contains the code used in S3 elections
>         - This code only needs to be modified slightly to be used with a Google Form instead of a Paperform
>         - This code takes in the CSV file and the UVCs from the ULT to ensure only valid votes are counted
> - Result Declaration
>     - The code output can be shared directly as the final result
>     - A sanitised version of the CSV file and the ULT can be released so that any member of the DAO can independently verify the results.
> 
> - Evaluation
>     - Security
>         - The security of the process can be guaranteed as long as access to the ULT and the Voting Form is restricted to only the CEC/BEC.
>     - Anonymity
>         - The security of the process can be guaranteed as long as access to the ULT and the Voting Form is restricted to only the CEC/BEC.
>     - Transparency
>         - After the end of the voting period, a sanitised version of the CSV file and the ULT can be released so that any member of the DAO can independently verify the results.
>     - Web3
>         
>         This solution is web2 end-to-end.
>         
> 
> Potential issues:
> 
> - The CEC/BEC have a lot of centralized power in this system.
>     - However, this centralization can be reduced if there are independent Election Officers in the EC.
