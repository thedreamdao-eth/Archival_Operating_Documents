>     - Social Media Coordinator: “DAO updates and information that I need to create content.”
>     - Dream Journalist: Sharing between email and Discord automatically.
>     - Agreement/Communications Coordinator: Setting up I voted POAP (for that, I think the POAP team will have to work on it).
> - Are there any ways you have already automated any of your tasks?
>     - Some respondents have largely standardized their workflow.
>     - One respondent has incorporated Calendly, Zapier, and other tools to automate parts of their workflow.

# 💭 Conclusions

> The following preliminary conclusions are drawn based on **General Responses** and **Other Responses**.
> 
> - Most respondents have standardized or are in the process of standardizing their workflow.
> - A standardized workflow makes the tasks streamlined and reduces the time taken for any task.
> - A standardized workflow also means that usually, there isn’t a good case to spend resources to try to automate the workflow.
> - Most suggestions the respondents gave will save little time if automated.
> - Hence, there are currently no viable avenues to pursue automation per the OKR.
