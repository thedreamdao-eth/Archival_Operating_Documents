# ðŸ’­Â Possible Issues

> 
> 
> - Referral spamming: Currently, there is no cap on the number of references an applicant can provide. Also, the Application Questions do not clearly inform applicants that they can provide multiple references.
> - Social Experience Score is only 10% of the base score
> - CU Score is at most 5% of the Base Score

# ðŸ›«Â Proposed Solutions

> 
> 
> - Capping the number of references allowed and communicating the same to applicants
> - Rescaling the relative weightage of the scores
