## OVERVIEW

A web3 x social impact DAO for Gen Z, by Gen Z

### What is the Dream DAO? 🤔

Powered by [Civics Unplugged](https://www.civicsunplugged.org/), the Dream DAO invests in the future of the web3 x social impact ecosystem by providing diverse Gen -Z’ers around the globe with the training, funding, mentorship, and opportunities they need to leverage the power of web3 to build a brighter future for humanity. 

We do this primarily by:

1. Fostering an **intergenerational learning community** for 15-20-year-olds seeking to be
and build the future of web3 x social impact.
2. Placing our most committed young community members in **meaningful paid internships** at socially impactful web3 organizations where they can receive **mentorship** and gain confidence as contributors to the web3 x social impact space.

### What makes Dream DAO unique? 🚀

***Builders and Champions***👥

The DAO consists of:

- **Builders:** 15-20 y/o Gen-Z’ers who are interested in exploring the intersection between web3 x social impact.
- **Champions:** Established leaders representing a range of industries who seed the Dream DAO with SkywalkerZ NFT purchases and direct donations to the DAO treasury, and lend their expertise, networks, and other resources to the DAO.

## VISION

🌞 The #solarpunk future we are helping build looks something like this:

![Untitled](Dream%20DAO%20in%20a%20Nutshell%F0%9F%8C%9E%2043c0add6b44647b4b070808d3b9f7a4a/Untitled.png)

**Our ultimate social goal is a future where:**

- Communities everywhere have benefited from capable builders who used their **web3 skills to regenerate communities and the planet**.
- Virtually any young person, anywhere in the world can access education that helps them **develop socially impactful web3 skills**.

**By 2030, Dream DAO will have:**

1. Directly supported multiple thousands of Gen Z Builders in leveraging and building **web3 to accelerate the flourishing of their communities and the world**.
2. Trained hundreds of people to start **social impact DAOs** that follow the blueprint of the Dream DAO.
3. **Inspired** over a million more **Gen Zers** outside of the DAO to explore and potentially work in the web3 x social impact space.
4. Helped define a vision for and supercharged the development of the web3 x social impact ecosystem at large.

## THEORY OF CHANGE 👀

How will we achieve this vision of **a future full of web3-powered social impact**? We are helping build the web3 x social impact ecosystem by investing in three complementary areas of focus:

**1. EMPOWERING LEARNING COMMUNITY:**

The Dream DAO cultivates an empowering, intergenerational, global community and offers a range of **learning + mentorship opportunities** that help young people gain confidence and experience at the intersection of web3 x social impact.

***Learning Together Sessions* 📚**

- LTs are the core product of the learning community of the Dream DAO. They are **hosted twice a week** and feature a  community member or guest hosting a lecture on a web3 concept. Click **[here](notion://www.notion.so/0612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda?v=796f0d3e8bc4404e9a17dcaca51161c1)** to see the recordings.
- Past guest hosts include Gitcoin founder [Kevin Owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki), Ethereum Foundation Executive Director [Aya Miyaguchi](https://twitter.com/AyaMiyagotchi), renowned web3 educator [Samina](https://twitter.com/saminacodes), co-founder of Constitution DAO [Graham Novak](https://twitter.com/gnovak_), and many more web3 luminaries.

**This is what a Learning Together session looks like:**

**Aya Miyaguchi** (Executive director of the Ethereum Foundation) joined the Dream DAO for ***Learning Together #28: Ethereum as an Infinite Garden | Discovering Your ‘Why’**.*  
It was a great session; we discussed the process of discovering our visions and purposes.

2**. WEB3 X SOCIAL IMPACT INTERNSHIP PROGRAM:**

**Dream DAO Explorers Program:**

- A three-month internship program for 15-20-year-olds.
- For the pilot program starting mid-June 2022, Dream DAO Builders were placed in impact-oriented web3 organizations (e.g. Celo, Regen Network, dOrg, etc.), and produced one knowledge artifact a month.

![The kickoff call for our summer 2022 internship program!](Dream%20DAO%20in%20a%20Nutshell%F0%9F%8C%9E%2043c0add6b44647b4b070808d3b9f7a4a/Untitled_(10).png)

The kickoff call for our summer 2022 internship program!

**Builders’ Statements:** 

> *As an intern at [Protein](https://twitter.com/protein), I worked primarily in their Good Growth and Funding teams. They gave me a plethora of projects to choose from, but I thought I could learn the most by working on communications and fundraising. By the end of the internship, I had created pitch decks for sponsorships, edited Good Growth materials, and written small pieces of content. The experience taught me a lot about maintaining team organization and morale in remote environments.*

> *I interned at [Celo](https://celo.org/)’s [Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/) as a ReFi Analyst. CC is working on a web3 x climate map and I was responsible for researching, outreaching, and summarizing information about different ReFi projects that was/could be at the map. I improved my communication skills and my ability to research about different organizations. I learned more about ReFi and discovered new projects building at the intersection of web3 and social impact.*
