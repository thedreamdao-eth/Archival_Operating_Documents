**Slides Changes**

1. First Slide; title

Have the DAO’s logo + a cool phrase [https://www.dreamdao.xyz/](https://www.dreamdao.xyz/)

****WE ARE TRAINING GEN ZERS TO USE WEB3 TO BUILD A BRIGHTER FUTURE**** 

1. Second Slide; introduction

Powered by [Civics Unplugged](https://www.civicsunplugged.org/), the [Dream DAO](https://dreamdao.xyz/) is a human accelerator for 15-20-year-olds who aim to build at the intersection of web3 and social impact.

- Nice to have a graphic here

Builders are exposed to the possibilities of this technology through our “Learning Together” sessions, apply their insights to working groups and bounties, and can develop their experiences through sponsored internships and conferences.

1. Third Slide; community

![Untitled](Pitchdeck%20Draft%2052715f434bb04bf78d2ded0a1d7e4242/Untitled%202.png)

1. Seventh Slide; builders
- Maybe a colored map of where all of our builders are from (US, India, Europe, South America, etc.)
- We can send out a form to all the builders to get the rest of the data (% women, % BIPOC, etc.)

1. Eighth Slide; 

Builder Spotlight

1. Rebeca Lissa — Bootcamp + ETH Mexico and Devcon
2. Madhav Goyal — community organizer and developer in the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems
3. Joshua Cruz — dOrg + DD work he has done
4. Jae-Hee Bae — Redemption DAO and how it opened auctions for the Congo Rainforest beyond just oil companies

1. Dream DAO Empowerment Ecosystem
- community: With our network of champions (experienced professionals in web2 or web3) and our weekly “Learning Together” sessions (talks by web3 leaders), we teach our builders the basics of web3 and how to execute.
- training: Builders also join 1-2 working groups, which makes them contributors toward the DAO’s key processes. Current working groups are Gatherings, Governance, and Grants, all lead by Builders.
- experiences: Our most dedicated builders are given the opportunity to attend web3 conferences and deepen their expertise through internships with organizations such as Celo, dOrg, and Protein.

During S2, they also had the opportunity to run for co-stewards, we now have both Champion and Builder running the DAO in part-time roles. (graphic)

1. Learning Together
- Learning Together are hour-long sessions with web3 professionals talking
- Past guests: Aya Miyaguchi — Executive Director of Ethereum Foundation, Kevin Owocki — cofounder of Gitcoin, Graham Novak — cofounder of Constitution DAO

1. Slide; Working Groups
- Feature the working groups we currently have (Gatherings, Grants, and NEAR) along with a blurb on the key results achieved for each one during S1&S2

![Untitled](Pitchdeck%20Draft%2052715f434bb04bf78d2ded0a1d7e4242/Untitled%203.png)

1. explorers program
- We had 12 builders receive **paid** internships with web3 organizations during S1 summer and 6 during S3 spring.

Add a logo board for all the partner organizations (aera force, dOrg, Climate Collective/Celo, protein, Loa labs, ecorise dao) 

1. IRL Gatherings
- We’ve been to ETHBogota, ETHMexico, NFT NYC, and DEVCON VI
- Feature ETHMexico and our builder's success at their hackathon
- Feature Devcon + the Learning Artifact
1. Current Backers

Might be useful to say that we have been backed by NEAR, Celo, Coinbase (add logos)

1. How we spend our funds

→ With Near we created a research group and granted 4 builders to explore and create learning resources around Near Protocol Ecosystem

→ Celo; IRL gatherings 

→ Coinbase; retroactive payments during s1, explorers payment during s1+ bounties >> two builders statement on how these stipends helped them

1. What’s next

With the grant we plan to 

- host 2-3 IRL gatherings
- reward builders for their work in Dream DAO etc
