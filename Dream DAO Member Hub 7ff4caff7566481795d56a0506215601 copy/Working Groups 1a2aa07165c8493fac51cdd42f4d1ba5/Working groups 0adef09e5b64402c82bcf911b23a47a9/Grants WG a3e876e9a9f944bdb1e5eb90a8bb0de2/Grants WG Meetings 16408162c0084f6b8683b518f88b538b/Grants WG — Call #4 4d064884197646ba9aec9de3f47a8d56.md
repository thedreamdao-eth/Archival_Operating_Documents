## [MAIN PART]

**The main part of our todayâ€™s meeting!** 

Thoughts & Ideas:

- **SkywalkerZ Airdrop; how can the WG take part in it? (let Harry take this on)**

Harry: if someone has experience in graphics and designing they could jump in and take on tasks to help the promotion of NFTs.

Keshav: twitter spaces with champions, sessions on discord (discord sessions), and podcast.

- **************************Grants Applications; some questions to help decide on the next steps**************************

*Buildersâ€™ thoughts on this is really important so we can bring more opportunities to you!!*

â†’ CU has many partners/donors, would they allow us to outreach or connect us with these orgs? Would that make sense to us?

Harry will bring this out with CU next Wednesday and let us know.

â†’ **Most grants applications want the DAO to have some sort of connection/build in their ecosystem;**

- [**How do I apply? (aavegrants.org)](https://aavegrants.org/how-do-i-apply) they have the option for events/hacking and educational resources â€” could we propose something more technical to builders that wants coding etc?**

Harry: what can we offer them; show them that we can maybe create content for Aaave and bring more younger folks to their ecosystem. Support young people to discover web3 space at the same time they share their learning with a younger audience

Keshav: we can do hackathons, builders create some projects in their protocol and share them on Twitter, etc, so we can have more Gen Z joining their ecosystem.

Harry: Do not mention hackathons as a milestone for a grant. We could still search for remote hacking, and bring tech and non-tech builders.

Shaan: DD could sponsor a bundle of different things to hack on; tech and non-tech. Green pill festival example.  

Amanda: internal hacking inside the DAO

Keshav: partnership to train builders to get technical skills, we could reach to Alchemy too. (still to get more details). 

- **Solana Grants ask; â€˜â€™ In your application, be sure to clarify how your project creates a public good for the Solana network, typically through furthering decentralization, open-sourcing code, or helping to secure the Solana network.â€™â€™ â€” could we propose something like Celo + use the grant for travels but also to sponsor panels conducted by builders in their colleges/schools?**

Keshav: SuperteamDAO

- [**https://poolgrants.org**](https://poolgrants.org/apply)

Content - memes, videos, blog posts, podcasts, editorials, other promotion 

## Reflections, what to improve, and feedback âœ¨

Harry: add bullet points to tasks so can guide builders
