## **Meeting Discussion**

**Educational Resources (scouting is still on the way)**

2 projects reached out to us though üëáüèº

****************************CTW X DREAM DAO****************************

1. Co-hosting a Twitter Space
    
    Between May 15-21st (SkywalkerZ Promo)
    
    Potential Topics: Diversity, intergenerational community, non-technical entrances into web3, building out an ecosystem in a central way.
    
2. Offering an educational partnership by allowing Dream DAO to host a module on W3 Learn Academy which aligns with your Gen Z-focused learning goals:
    
    [https://pitch.com/public/afedcb50-d93e-4ebb-96f7-0c2b28d811c4](https://pitch.com/public/afedcb50-d93e-4ebb-96f7-0c2b28d811c4)
    
3. Send CTW the Explorers Program Interest Form (Amanda will have it done this weekend)

Next Steps:

- setting up the twitter spaces, 2 builders and a champion + decide on a topic
- Start exploring internship opportunity with CTW (this would be a good exchange for running a masterclass etc)
- masterclass; ask about a possible bounty, NFT access for all DD members etc

**************************Atlantis DAO************************** 

‚Üí bounty based learning experience in their own App (launch will be after mid-May); builders do a ReFi course, get certificates. To promote, we would have an artwork collab with both DD and Atlantis Logos.

**************Gitcoin Promo for the next week**************

‚Üí Adarsh and Amanda planning to have some Twitter Spaces done:

what projects could we outreach/invite? one per Space or multiples? 

something more like; gitcoin radio or with a specific topic like we did with Atlantis?

-ReFibySouth? 
-****H.E.R. DAO?****

-Basin DAO

-Plant Gang
-REFI DAO
-**Regens Unite**

ED3 projects ‚Üí 

- 2-3 builders write Learning Artifacts around their learning/accomplishment in the past months as a builder
- canva deck

**Grants** 

[Welcome to Camp.Social](https://www.camp.social/)

‚Üí is only 1k but might be a good opportunity to have builders engaged, we can delegate to them the social activities and have them hosting it + promoting (maybe a group of people)
Email for outreach (PlantBoi spoke previously): [amber@absolutesum.co](mailto:amber@absolutesum.co) 

- I believe the timing is close to SkywalkerZ promo so we can use it in that sense as well

[Atom Accelerator DAO](https://www.atomaccelerator.com/)

Events, Marketing & Education Grant for üëáüèº

a) Onboarding Web2 developers into the Cosmos Hub community

b) Hackathons

c) Community events & conference sponsoring

- We still need to check if the DAO is eligible and if we need to build something for them, how would it be (if is something with more work or something alike Celo)

‚Üí technical + non-technical, mix of hacking and also content how we do with Celo (writing doc, onboarding genz with some content etc) ‚Äî if we can‚Äôt have this presented in a application we can outreach to them and propose it. 

[PoolGrants](https://poolgrants.org/82383755c2c8431eade3651ad7de7948)

Same as Atom, but applying as ‚Äò‚ÄôContent - memes, videos, blog posts, podcasts, editorials, other promotional-type contributions‚Äô‚Äô, still need to check but if we can manage to do something like Celo we could send a proposal!
