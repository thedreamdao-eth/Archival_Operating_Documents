4. 🗳️ **Proceeding with the S3 Elections.**
The process will be set up by Adarsh.
****Although we’ve chosen the toolset we’ll use for the upcoming elections, it would be good to keep a finger on the pulse of Vocdoni, as it seems like they’re down to support us if we won’t to get a dev to create this cool voting mechanism. 
5. 🫂 **Membership Renewal** 
The process has been updated, now it is time to get it in the hands of CBWG to execute.

## Post-Clarity ****Task Management

**The main part of our today’s meeting!** 

Thoughts & Ideas:

- As it was discussed during the last GWG Meeting, it turned out that we don’t really need Clarity. But there’s still a need to check in on progress of the WGs!
    - That’s why I had a thought of going back to our previous way of managing the WG tasks - **the Notion database**
        - What are your thoughts on this?
            - ***Yes***
- But this system is more than just a place to log the tasks. To be efficient, it should be reviewed by somebody, and monthly scorecards should be shared with the Voting Members of the DAO.
- Is there anything we’re missing?
    - How could we further improve this system
    - Implement the scorecards in the process

## Tasks:

- Async feedback on the budget doc - GWG
    - Share the budget with GWG for comments - Tim ✅
- Ask Julieta to share the canva template for the badge - Tim ✅
- Ask Adarsh to start working on the elections - Tim ✅
- DM Aditya on the Python vote counter - Tim ✅
- Re-create a Notion Task-Management database for S3
