### *Icebreaker*

- Aditya: Having a firm deadline for each part of the project is essential to prevent procrastination.

1. **Clarity**

1. 3/4-day Crash course on Clarity (30min sessions)
2. AMA/LT session with Richie right after (Clarity cofounder) 
2. **Elections** 
As the timeline has been done, the form seeking thje election committee will be released in 2 days (on May 22)
3. **We will have one more system to design - *a good old Merit-based Voting System***
Governance WG will take on designing this in June, as working on it DAO-wide didn’t amount to much progress. This will likely take many meetings, so be ready that we might be working on this for entire June!
