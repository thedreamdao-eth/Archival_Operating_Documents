## Updates

## Main part - Treasury!

1. **Treasury objectives:**
What is the expected use of the treasury? (I.e. Pay for what, when, and for how long?)
    
    
    Has to pay for: 
    
    *We need to summarize what can/canâ€™t be paid for* 
    
    - Peopleâ€™s time
        - Persistent roles
        - Bounties
    - Explorerâ€™s program
    - One-off expenses
        - Travel expenses
    
    Open questions: 
    
    - Is there an expense process?
    - Who runs the treasury?
    - Are we responsible for creating the compensation structure?
    
    Notes: 
    
    - There is an estimated budget on the Future Fund proposal (operations, core contributors, and stipends).
    
    Now, letâ€™s do a summary:
    
    - 
2. **Key Design Questions:**
- What should be the structure of our Treasury?  Should it be all Ethereum?  Should we be considering stablecoins?  What is the risk if we do not put it into stablecoins?
    - **Shaan**: Should be multi-chain
    - **Prof**: There is no hurt having some proportion of the Treasury in Stablecoins to prevent large movements in ETH.  It would be a smart move, perhaps we have stablecoin balances for what we project our spending will be for the year?
    - **Nathan:** Most of the treasury - stablecoins.
- Will we accept NFTs into our Treasury?  This is a way to affirm partnership with other DAOs (they would also accept a Skywalkerz as a show of support)
    - Prof: We should accept NFTs.  They are easily transferrable and they can perhaps get the DAO access to certain perks and benefits of other organizations (like a Skywalkerz gets you into learning together sessions)
- Do we consider using some DeFi protocols and other ways to earn interest on our Treasury balances so we can be more proactive in earning money for the DreamDAO without being fully dependent on outside investment?  Some protocols give up to 20% interest on balances staked.
    - Prof: Yes, we should be putting the money to work when we have periods of downtime.  Taking that money and making interest enables us to continue working sustainably.  We will need to coordinate a strategy
- Do we create a formalized process to request funds outside of proposals voted on snapshot?  (I.E set a budget of funds that can be accessed via this ad hoc process)
    - Prof: Yes, there should be more business as usual funds that should be a less extensive process than snapshot.  But there should be an upper limit bound on how much
- What are the key expenses we believe should always be baked into the budgeting process for Treasury (explorers program, new builder NFT mint cost etc).
    - Prof: NFT mint cost, explorers program, a budget set aside for conferences etc.  These things are a constant and should always be at the ready.  Other things will come up.  We will also have to consider any operational expenses.  I am not sure if CU covers things like legal etc.
1. **Treasury Tooling:**
What do we have now? What do we need to successfully manage the treasury?
Who will take on this task? (Fran x Shaan expressed interest)
    - Gnosis safe

## Tasks:

**Summary: Nathan x David comes up with a doc on Treasury - and we discuss it during the next meeting**

- Shaan, Fran, ? -Research the Treasury Tooling

## **Next meeting ideas:**

- As we firstly have to develop Treasury, the next topic should be:
- **Continue with Design Questions**
- **Tooling ideas for Treasury + some explanation**
- **Treasury Operations**
