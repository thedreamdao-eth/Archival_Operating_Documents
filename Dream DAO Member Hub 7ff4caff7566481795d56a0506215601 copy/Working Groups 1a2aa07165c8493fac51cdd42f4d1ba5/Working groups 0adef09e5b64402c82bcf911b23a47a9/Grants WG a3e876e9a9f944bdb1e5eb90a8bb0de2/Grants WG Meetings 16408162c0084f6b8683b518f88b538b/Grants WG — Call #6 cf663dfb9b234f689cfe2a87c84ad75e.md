is simple and it might not take longer than 10 minutes, we just need to connect a wallet and then share our website, socials, project logo, and description. 

1. Apply to a Round as Explorer

[How to apply to a round in Explorer](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants-program/project-owners/how-to-apply-to-a-round-in-explorer)

‚Üí how will the promotion work?

Carl: good logo + banner image and a straightforward description; networking activation.

Harry: use our CRM (NFT one); collective support- Impact NFT academy etc

---

- **Explorers Program will happen between May-August, and there are some things we need to improve**

‚Üí Many builders applied and got matched but didn‚Äôt begin the internship because of the host‚Äôs thoughtless

**How can we improve builders matching?**

**Amanda:** having *Intern Host Interest Paperform* and builder interview back!

**What are some potential hosts we can scout?**

[DDAO S3 Potential Explorers Sites](../../../../Key%20Projects%2076c20a84f2fa4ecb86f9777d4acdf932/Explorers%20Program%20394508bf84ab449eb26db9ca636148e0/DDAO%20S3%20Potential%20Explorers%20Sites%20eab86b93611a4512bbe68f7973d11607.md)

[Potential Dream DAO Explorers Program Internship / New Contributor Host Sites](../../../../Key%20Projects%2076c20a84f2fa4ecb86f9777d4acdf932/Explorers%20Program%20394508bf84ab449eb26db9ca636148e0/Potential%20Dream%20DAO%20Explorers%20Program%20Internship%20N%20cf941270856f4ed59b2dc340e7c430a6.md)

**Amanda:** we could check Hodlers, Friends of the DAO, Champions, and CRM list to see which contacts we have across these past Host Sites, so we outreach to them later on

Carl: hosts share the details on roles, what they are looking for, payments etc

Ibtehaj: check how many people completed their internships, look for if we can go again with any hosts ‚Äî> generate learning artifacts for socials ‚Üí raise awareness for next round of hosts

Carl: use gitcoin awareness and try to use it in the internship scouting (bring back Learning Artifacts)

- **Define grants timeline and goals for April-May**

 [GRANTS WG ‚Äî OKRs S3](../Grants%20WG%20Docs%20fd34a906f076416cb013603026568267/GRANTS%20WG%20%E2%80%94%20OKRs%20S3%20215de60f7ab8472894c5f7c024b25e80.md)

1. Gitcoin
2. EF Grant
3. SkywalkerZ Promo
4. Explorers Program
- 5. Digital learning experiences (check Harry‚Äôs message below)
    
    ‚Äò‚ÄôForm small groups of 'scouts' to look for the most valuable resources, e.g. a paid consensys dev course
    
    [https://courses.consensys.net/courses/blockchain-essentials-an-introduction-to-blockchain](https://courses.consensys.net/courses/blockchain-essentials-an-introduction-to-blockchain)
    
    -Builders who scout then write up messages to these orgs, tailored to the specific requests we have, asking if they want to support the DAO with free access to them + giving some background 
    -We as a community check the messages here, then send them off either from Amanda's email, the DD Twitter, or the orgs website contact form (Twitter is often great as our following gives us credibility)
    -Keep track of responses (leaving **@amanda maritan** email address for them to return messages to) and feedback here about offerings. Some may request some highlighting of a partnership etc in return for resources, so we can discuss here situations to just make sure it's 'worth' the trade.‚Äô‚Äô
    

‚Üí builders help us to find and secure these resources; some are üëáüèº

Dune Analytics & The Graph (web3 data), Messari & Bankless ( web3 media companies ‚Üí 1-2 month access to their content, free subscription)

Combo with learning artifact generation for the company = good promo relationship and value offering in return for the tools/courses

Potentially bolt on a Champion to support the builder journey through a resource

Bankless (try to use local markets e.g BanklessDAO Brazil, and then work on creating resources in portuguese, etc)

**‚Üí SkywalkerZ Promo:**

- Before launch we need to work on documents (update it), guides, outreach templates (se we can send later, close/during the sale), and CRM.
- Have builders/champs sharing their experience in a genuine way.

‚Üí Have testimonials of builders so we can kinda spread the idea of ‚Äò‚Äôbuy the the NFT and you can help more builders to achieve that‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äî have champs testimonials on how taking part in the DD impacted them, let them share the importance of being a champion for themselves.

********************************************************************************************Explore what we can bring to benefit Champions******************************************************************************************** 

‚Üí Work on a one-pager to share details on champs role (what they can do, time bandwith), hodler benefits etc, add champs and builders testimonials 

- How can we decide on the Outreach team? Application or volunteering?

outreach team would be helping with potential twitter spaces, CRM.

‚Üí we don‚Äôt want to just push people to buying it; we should present the idea and make them interested on it.

‚Üí show how our project is unique, not use the usual NFT sale tactics 

Have Marco to work with us on getting info coming out already; 

### Tasks ‚úÖ

We need 2-3 builders (at least one S1-S2 and one from S3) for each task (it will be shared on Discord too so everyone can volunteer and then we will do a random spin)
