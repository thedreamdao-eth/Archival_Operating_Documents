ðŸ“¢ Whatâ€™s up w/ the tasks?

## Updates

1. **New Strategy 
The general strategy is 3 weeks per task with tasks overlapping after the 1st week.** 
**It is based on design docs, one meeting for live feedback (+further async feedback), and a proposal to solidify the change DAO-wide and start implementation.**

**This will help us:**

- Meet our Key Results in time!
- Increase Meeting efficiency by discussing design docs and assigning tasks instead of doing things that can be done async.
- Ensure diverse engagement in the WG, as the next design doc task is going to be asssigned before the previous one is finished.

1. **Meeting Time Updates**
As we move to discussing key DAO design topics with our new strategy, we have to use our time as effectively as we can. To improve quantity / quality of the live feedback, the meetings are now starting **at 09:10 PM EST on Fridays and go on for about an hour.**
