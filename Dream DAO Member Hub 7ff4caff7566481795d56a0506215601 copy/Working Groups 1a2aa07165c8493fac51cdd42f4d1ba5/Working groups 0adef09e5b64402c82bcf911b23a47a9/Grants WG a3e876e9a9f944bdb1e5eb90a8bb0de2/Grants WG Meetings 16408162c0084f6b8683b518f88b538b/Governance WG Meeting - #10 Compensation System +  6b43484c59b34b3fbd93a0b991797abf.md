### *Icebreaker*

**Prompt: Whatâ€™s the best money advice youâ€™ve heard?**

- Tim:
- Shaan: Always have multiple streams of income.
- Carl: Save more than you spend; compounding is powerful stuff
Sunk cost fallacy
^ Second best money advice
- David: save early, save often
- Prof: There is an opportunity cost to holding money.  Everyday you arenâ€™t putting it to work, you are losing money!
- Arath: do not spend like youâ€™ll get paid next month
- Nathan: Diversify. Bulls make money, Bears make money, pigs get slaughtered (dont be greedy)
- Madison: Nick (Co-founder of CU) taught me how to set up a credit card, Roth IRA, and index fund when I moved to NYC in august ðŸ˜ŠÂ has been so helpful just to get started!
