### DISCUSSION

 [Grants Applications](../Grants%20WG%20Docs%20fd34a906f076416cb013603026568267/Grants%20Applications%202f9bdbc9ce014718ad04da21b7dbeec6.md) 

1. Open Sea Grants 

â†’ Community Education; Resources to support the onboarding and educating new users to help make NFTs and web3 more approachable.

**Thoughts:**

- Share about how we use NFT for DAO Members and voting + we will onboard new GenZ in next season, how will NFT impact them, and how we can educate them about NFTs for impact
- As milestones, we can add: hosting up to 5 LT sessions/Twitter Spaces focused on using NFTs for good (artifacts like Artizen, NFTrees, etc); Small guides on NFTs for education, community, impact, and voting
- Rebeca wrote this doc [Doc with benefits to grantors ](../../../WG%20Task%20Database%20f0b831139428483bb46b7e103ecb9dcf/Doc%20with%20benefits%20to%20grantors%20e391a5668be840c4ad8f3116caff8824.md) we could use â€˜â€™brand awareness and communityâ€™â€™ to also help non-web3 people learn about NFTs (many have a distorted idea about it), we could possibly host a Bonfire/Talk on the next CU Fellowship cohort

[Educational Resources Scouting ](../../../WG%20Task%20Database%20f0b831139428483bb46b7e103ecb9dcf/Educational%20Resources%20Scouting%20898b0a8754f94422b3f9ffe39b9ffd21.md) 

(go over some potential proposals for these projects/organizations), prep for Season 4

**Notes:** check which orgs would be up to partner with us for BootCamp (Consensys especially + see if they are up for DDEP (Thessy has contacts in there, so checking that with her. 

- Would be great to have some learning resources for S4 and potentially hackathons (virtual) or something that will give builders a better engagement
- For other resources, instead of partnering, check how we can help builders to get that (less DAO involvement, just support builders to get some cool courses etc they might want)

**Camp Social first event: what should we do?** 

â†’ Kickoff call, like a community event + Amber and Brad could join and make a walk through the platform if builders feel like is necessary or we invite them for an LT session in the future about a topic around remote communities.

â†’ Have builders & champs schedule their own sessions by themselves, no need to be overseen by Co-stewards, gatherings, or LT coordinator 

â†’ Potentially have Community Calls open for non-DD members in the platform

â†’ Share with our CRM, Hodlers, and Donors about the Camp Social + add the local Meet Ups in DD Camp so they can join you 

**Notes:** potentially have a mentorship kickoff call in DD Camp + during DDEP have builders sharing their experiences etc with external communities who are looking for internships (how to get one, dos & donâ€™ts), potentially a place for Video Learning Artifacts 

**Timeline for June**

- DDEP
