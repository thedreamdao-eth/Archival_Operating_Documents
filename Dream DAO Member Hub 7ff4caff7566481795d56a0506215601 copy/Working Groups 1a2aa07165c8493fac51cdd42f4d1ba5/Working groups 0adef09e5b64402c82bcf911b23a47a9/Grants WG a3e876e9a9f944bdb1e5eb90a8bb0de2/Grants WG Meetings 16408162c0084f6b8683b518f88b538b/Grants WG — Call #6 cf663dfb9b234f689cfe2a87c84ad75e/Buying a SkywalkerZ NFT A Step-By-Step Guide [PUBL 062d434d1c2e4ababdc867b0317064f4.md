1. **Turn your Fiat ($,¬£,‚Ç¨, etc.) into Ethereum (Cryptocurrency). For most of you the easiest way to do that will be via¬†[COINBASE](http://www.coinbase.com/).**

2. **Once you‚Äôve setup a Coinbase account, purchase some Ethereum** (If you're buying one  SkywalkerZ, you‚Äôll probably want to buy around **0.15 Ethereum**‚Äîto cover the 0.1 ETH cost of the SkywalkerZ and the gas fees required to transfer your Ethereum to your Ethereum wallet like MetaMask and mint the NFT. You will likely have Ethereum left over.)
