## Merit Badges

**Time to finalize our efforts on the GWG badges + oplan the next steps!**

Thoughts & Ideas:

1. **Updated GWG Merit Badge list:** 
    1. Finalize the doc for GWG 
    
    [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PAuVmAg_CQGMg9mvgJ0psoVcVt1rlWkfJTEno51KsCc/edit?pli=1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PAuVmAg_CQGMg9mvgJ0psoVcVt1rlWkfJTEno51KsCc/edit?pli=1)
    
    1. Start outlining the Merit Badges for DAO
    2. Develop guidelines for other WG leads to work on their WG badges
    
2. **Art for the Merit Badges:**
I know we had come to an agreement of using the AI art, I just wanted to make sure we are aware of the pros and cons of each method.
    1. ***Using DALL-E AI art:***
        1. Benefits:
            - Easier to create
            - Free
            - Will give the Merit system a touch of innovation
        2. Problems:
            - The art might be messy
            - It will be hard to standardize the art
        3. Tentative plan:
            1. Have a group of 3 people test out the DALL-E capabilities. Especially the ability of the AI to create similarly-styled art.
        
    2. ***Using the help of artists:***
        1. Benefits:
            - Art will be neat
            - Art will be standardized
            - Art will be adjustable
        2. Problems:
            - Might cost us money to pay the artist
            - Might take more time
        
        [Tentative plan:](../../../../Design%20Documents%20&%20Braindumps%2096c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae/Dream%20DAO%20Merit%20Badges%20implementation%20936a577c2f3249809d49b0d1508ef308/Tentative%20plan%20121cf21ec6a44048b7a3d1dbb16399fd.md)
