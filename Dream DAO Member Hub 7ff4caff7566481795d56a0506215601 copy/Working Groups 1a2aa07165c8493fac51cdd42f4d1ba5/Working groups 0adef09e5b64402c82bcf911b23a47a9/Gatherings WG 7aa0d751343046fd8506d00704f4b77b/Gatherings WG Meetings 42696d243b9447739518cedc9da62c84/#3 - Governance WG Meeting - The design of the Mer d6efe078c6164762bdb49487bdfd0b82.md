## Updates

1. **üè¶ Budget spreadsheet is ready.**

2. [Phase 2 Governance WG Strategy](../../../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Working%20Groups%20Home%20Season%201%204d1702104a2f4180a27e92b0510bd283/Dream%20DAO%20Phase%201%20Working%20Groups%20c53752864e064f6da1b9f1c4ed1019ba/Governance%20WG%20%5BLegacy%5D%20a464f56462524c87842951a5c5d8b9f0/Phase%202%20Governance%20WG%20Strategy%2059d1179fa24d4f7c870ba24f9acd36d1.md) **is being built out.**
I‚Äôve spent some time tinkering with current key results + thinking about the best way to complete them, so here‚Äôs what I came up with. 
*Most sync time will be spent on two major systems (Merit System + Active Member Policy), while minor issues like improving Elections and understanding of the DAO Governance System will require mostly async work and 1-2 sync meets.*
