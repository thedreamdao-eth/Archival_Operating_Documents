ðŸŒ±**GM! Glad you joined the session!** 

### *Icebreaker*

**Prompt: Whatâ€™s the best way to deal with commitments / tasks when youâ€™re overwhelmed by them?**

- Tim: Iâ€™ve tried mapping them out on a list of paper and sorting out the least important ones
- Carl: [Pomodoro](https://www.revolutionlearning.co.uk/article/how-to-use-the-pomodoro-technique/) method. [Centered](https://www.centered.app/) is a fun app to help use the pomodoro method.
- Shaan: Getting back to the basics by writing a physical list and taking intentional breaks!
- David: Get the small things done first, so the big things are easier to focus on
- Angelina: write everythings down thatâ€™s on your head to get a bit more clarity and afterwards create a weekly plan distributing your tasks throughout the weeks (you canâ€™t do everything on one day but having a weekly plan will make you feel like youâ€™re not ignoring it but dividing it up in a healthy way)
- Madison: Calendar out my tasks + day so I know what to expect and know how much to plan for each day
- Shreya: Creating a to-do list and finding time to accomplish those things along with taking breaks
