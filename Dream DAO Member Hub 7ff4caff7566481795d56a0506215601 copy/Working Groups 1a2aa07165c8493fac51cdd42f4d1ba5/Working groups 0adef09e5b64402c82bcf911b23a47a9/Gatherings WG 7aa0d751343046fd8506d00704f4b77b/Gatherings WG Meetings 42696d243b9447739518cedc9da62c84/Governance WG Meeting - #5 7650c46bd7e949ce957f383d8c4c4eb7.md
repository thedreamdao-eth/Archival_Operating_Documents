## Treasury Management

**The main part of our todayâ€™s meeting!** (HUGE shoutout to Prof for helping with this):

- What should be the structure of our Treasury?  Should it be all Ethereum?  Should we be considering stablecoins?  What is the risk if we do not put it into stablecoins?
    - **Shaan**: Should be multi-chain
    
    Tim: What percentage should be in stablecoins? 
    
    - **Shaan**: It should depend on the market. The process should be data-driven
    
    Madison: Should there be an ongoing group for this? 
    
    - **Shaan**: We could have an async dashboard and make it pretty automated
    
    Tim: How would we do this? 
    
    - **Chabu**: It is hard to have this discussion without knowing what this typically looks like
    - **Angelina**: We could use a pros and cons list
    - **Fran**: Has a lot of experience with this. First we need to discuss the objective of the treasury
- Will we accept NFTs into our Treasury?  This is a way to affirm partnership with other DAOs (they would also accept a Skywalkerz as a show of support)
    - 
- Do we consider using some DeFi protocols and other ways to earn interest on our Treasury balances so we can be more proactive in earning money for the DreamDAO without being fully dependent on outside investment?  Some protocols give up to 20% interest on balances staked.
    - 
- Do we create a formalized process to request funds outside of proposals voted on snapshot?  (I.E set a budget of funds that can be accessed via this ad hoc process)
    - 
- What are the key expenses we believe should always be baked into the budgeting process for Treasury (explorers program, new builder NFT mint cost etc).
