🌱**GM! Glad you joined the session!** 

### *Icebreaker*

**Prompt: What tasks/activities do you believe should NOT be awarded with financial compensations?**

- Tim: Most likely drafting the proposals
+ the taco count (hard to say if we should use it as a metric for assigning merit either)
- Madhav:
- Nathan: Voting (would be great if we can encourage everyone to vote with a non-financial stimulus)
- David: Anything that requires active work should be paid in $$. Anything that is just an activity should be non-financial
- Shaan: Shoutouts because they are a good way to represent a merit activity. Furthermore maybe low value evangelizing
- Aishah: .
- Aditya:
- Akshaya:
