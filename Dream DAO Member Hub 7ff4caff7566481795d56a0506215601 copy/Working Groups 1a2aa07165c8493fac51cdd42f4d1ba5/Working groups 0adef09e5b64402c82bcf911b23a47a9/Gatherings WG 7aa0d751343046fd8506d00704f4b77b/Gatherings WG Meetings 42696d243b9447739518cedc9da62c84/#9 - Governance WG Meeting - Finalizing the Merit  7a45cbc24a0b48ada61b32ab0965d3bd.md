📢 What’s up w/ the tasks?

## Updates

1. 🔴 **Reminder for me to record the meeting!**
2. 🗓️ **Updated strategy!**
I had to rethink the strategy to cover all of the important aspects and to correspond to the amount of time we have until the end of S2. 
I did not create a separate doc for it, as it should be pretty straightforward from the meeting sequence in the WG Hub. 
3. 📄 **********************************************A [Dream DAO Merit Badge List](../../../../Merit%20System%204518d4b074e641898c4609940e10778f/Dream%20DAO%20Merit%20Badge%20List%202c9df81dd8d44702ae0214c02c7ccd25.md) has been compiled by Madison.**
It contains information on the names, acquisition requirements, types, and levels of all the Merit Badges Dream DAO has developed so far! 
4. 🎨 **The Merit Badge design has been selected.**
For those who didn’t get to see this yet! 
*There are also some minor changes to be done to that design, but it’s pretty much the final version.
