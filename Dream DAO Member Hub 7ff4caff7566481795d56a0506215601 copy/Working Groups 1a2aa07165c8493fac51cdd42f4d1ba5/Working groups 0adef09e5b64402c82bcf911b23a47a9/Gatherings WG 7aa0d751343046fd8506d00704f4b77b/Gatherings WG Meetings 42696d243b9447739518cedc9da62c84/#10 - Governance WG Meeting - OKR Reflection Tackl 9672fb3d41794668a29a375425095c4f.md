**Issue - Context - Ways to tackle it**

- [Create a general guide for the use of Bounties in Dream DAO](../../../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Working%20Groups%20Home%20Season%201%204d1702104a2f4180a27e92b0510bd283/Dream%20DAO%20Phase%201%20Working%20Groups%20c53752864e064f6da1b9f1c4ed1019ba/Governance%20WG%20%5BLegacy%5D%20a464f56462524c87842951a5c5d8b9f0/Governance%20WG%20in%20Season%202%207538a4c8c3a8416cba1924d3b0457068.md)
    - Help each working group set its own budget and use the policy to issue bounties
        - Make sure that at least 2 Builders per working group earn bounties
    - **Way to tackle:** Make it a bounty to create one as itâ€™s more DAO-wide, but GWG is still responsible for it
    
- [Create greater visibility on the state of our finances (current assets and projected income)](../../../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Working%20Groups%20Home%20Season%201%204d1702104a2f4180a27e92b0510bd283/Dream%20DAO%20Phase%201%20Working%20Groups%20c53752864e064f6da1b9f1c4ed1019ba/Governance%20WG%20%5BLegacy%5D%20a464f56462524c87842951a5c5d8b9f0/Governance%20WG%20in%20Season%202%207538a4c8c3a8416cba1924d3b0457068.md)
    - Seems like this hasnâ€™t really been solved with the budget doc (source of truth) that we had before ( [[OLD] Dream DAO Finances Source Of Truth ](../../../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/%5BOLD%5D%20Dream%20DAO%20Finances%20Source%20Of%20Truth%209943dd112f2047de92f733c1b1c592f8.md)).
        - Iâ€™ve heard it being brought up a bunch of times before, plus seen that people are still checking the [OLD] finances doc (even 9 days ago)
            
            ![Untitled](../../Governance%20WG%207176155b78f94db99ac1e17aad125f46/Governance%20WG%20Meetings%208818ea33b54a432ab37717683ebcb05f/#10%20-%20Governance%20WG%20Meeting%20-%20OKR%20Reflection%20Tackl%20adefa1d4e88d443294518d2485f38c82/Untitled.png)
            
    - Hereâ€™s the new finances spreadsheet:
        
        [Google Sheets: Sign-in](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pEQG4qnQjTddHTF6pyzhO5CDNFEz-CFC8d0Shdu8qKE/edit#gid=1310046796)
        
    - **Ways to solve**:
        - We should explore creating an **`#**ðŸ”— | **internal-links**` channel in Discord where we can put the links to all the import info that we want to share only with our internal community of voting members.
        - We can make monthly and seasonal announcements on the budget, sending a screenshot of the monthly spreadsheet into the Dreamerz announcements channel
            - Maybe graphics to show the budget? and post it on the internal links every month for skywalker holders
    
- [Look for automations on our Gnosis Safe and treasury controls to manage cost](../../../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Working%20Groups%20Home%20Season%201%204d1702104a2f4180a27e92b0510bd283/Dream%20DAO%20Phase%201%20Working%20Groups%20c53752864e064f6da1b9f1c4ed1019ba/Governance%20WG%20%5BLegacy%5D%20a464f56462524c87842951a5c5d8b9f0/Governance%20WG%20in%20Season%202%207538a4c8c3a8416cba1924d3b0457068.md)
    - What specifically do we need automate on our GSafe?
        - We already have Utopia labs for payments
    - How should we go about solving this?
        - Tag prof on this @Tyler Stambaugh
