📢 What’s up w/ the tasks?

## Updates

1. **Clarity Onboarding** 
We’ll have to plan a session to onboard the WG members into Clarity and start populating it
2. **Elections**
Followed up with Shreya yesterday: she’ll be unplugging for a while, but told me that she’ll start working on it after May 11. Next step is an application form for the Election Board members.
Hence, the Elections will be postponed, but should happen by May 26-27, just so we have some time to onboard new WG Coordinators before Phase 2.

**Currently taken on:**
1️⃣ **Define clear-cut organizational structure** (with defined roles with clear responsibilities and compensation system) 🎯

2️⃣ **Create a plan for working group compensations** (How do we use the WG’s Budget to compensate it’s active members?) ✅

### 🔎 Milestones Revision

Now, let’s take a brief look at the Milestones for Phase 1 and decide whether they should be changed according to what we discussed earlier:

[Governance WG [Legacy]](../../../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Working%20Groups%20Home%20Season%201%204d1702104a2f4180a27e92b0510bd283/Dream%20DAO%20Phase%201%20Working%20Groups%20c53752864e064f6da1b9f1c4ed1019ba/Governance%20WG%20%5BLegacy%5D%20a464f56462524c87842951a5c5d8b9f0.md) 

E.g.: Develop detailed documentation on governance (+update the whitepapers) 
- **Do we need this? 
- What documentation should it be? 
- What sections of the Whitepaper should we update?**
