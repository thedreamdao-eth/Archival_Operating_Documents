üå±**GM! Glad you joined the session!** 

### *Icebreaker*

**Prompt: Favorite Netflix series?**

## And we‚Äôre starting... Now! üöÄ

<aside>
üì¢ What‚Äôs up w/ the tasks?

## Updates

1. üî¥ **Reminder for me to record the meeting!**
2. üåä **Seems like we don‚Äôt need Clarity.**
Integrating Clarity in Dream DAO workflow seems to have not been that crucial, as the **payments are now done through the more convenient Utopia**, while the same **token-gating** that made the tool desirable initially is now the problem, as it **allegedly creates an obstacle to easily log tasks** (over the course of S2, I am basically the only one who logs them).
What are your thoughts?
**Yes**
3. üöÄ **Launching the Merit System**
    1. [Merit System Coordinator](../../../../Recurring%20Roles%20630c77f965f644b5866ad23752df0e38/Merit%20System%20Coordinator%2079d58a5ad24c4128a2ddda74b6e6df00.md)**Home is ready.** 
    It includes databases for minting inquiries and merit system stats, the badges list, and the ideas&suggestions database!
    2. üë§**Merit Minter - almost onboarded.** 
    I‚Äôve explained everything approval/stats related. Technical minting explanation should be done by Madhav on Sunday.
    3. üí° **Two new badge ideas.**
        
        Shoutout to Mads for suggesting to create the [](../../../../Recurring%20Roles%20630c77f965f644b5866ad23752df0e38/Merit%20System%20Coordinator%2079d58a5ad24c4128a2ddda74b6e6df00/Merit%20System%20Ideas%20&%20Suggestions%209536236b6bf345c89a102ba0f8ad76d4.md) form and to Prabhat for sending the first set of ideas:
        
        1. DAO-Wide: Note Taker
        
        > It is restricted to taking notes in WG meeting notes but builders take notes for LTs as well, so maybe change it to ‚Äúfor taking notes for 3 meetings‚Äù instead of just for WG meeting notes.
        > 
        
        2. DAO-wide: Learner
        
        > This is currently one Merit Badge for attending 3 LTs. Maybe add 2 more badges (level 2 and 3) for attending 8 LTs (level 2) and 13+ LTs (level 3) since LTs are one of the core things in the DAO.
        > 
    4. üîß **Merit Badge Design Issues are now getting fixed.**
        
        Some issues were found in the design of the Merit Badges. 
        Julieta is currently fixing them.
        Would appreciate if somebody would volunteer to double-check the badge designs!
        
4. üó≥Ô∏è **Election tooling research.**
    1. I did a quick look through Vocdoni. It is different from Snapshot in some ways (e.g. the need to upload a csv with voters before each vote), BUT it seems that they are the closest we can get to the anonymous voting so far and also seem to include all the key voting features.  
        
        [template-file.csv](../../Governance%20WG%207176155b78f94db99ac1e17aad125f46/Governance%20WG%20Meetings%208818ea33b54a432ab37717683ebcb05f/#12%20-%20Governance%20WG%20Meeting%20-%20Member%20Mobility%20Poli%20cb2c7fe868184f51a586c065bf334e23/template-file.csv)
        
    2. Josh is working on the [Vocdoni Voting Guide](https://www.notion.so/Vocdoni-Voting-Guide-f32fedb8e75c4c00a5ca335f7f532be2?pvs=21)
    3. No ranked choice voting yet, BUT it looks like if we find a dev we can use their SDK and build it ourselves (as far as my non-tech mind gets it):

    4. **We should use Paperform for voting as there‚Äôs no web3 solution that‚Äôs decent enough**

## Member Mobility Policy

**The main part of our today‚Äôs meeting!** 

Here‚Äôs the objective from our S2 WG Vision doc:  

<aside>
üéØ **Set policy for what it means to be ‚ÄúActive‚Äù in the DAO**

- Partner with Community WG to define policy for participant mobility options, ie, make it clearer how people can move through Dream DAO
    - Implement the policy in a decentralized and transparent manner
        - We don‚Äôt want 1 or 2 people in the DAO deciding who is ‚Äúactive‚Äù or ‚Äúinactive‚Äù
        - We want transparent metrics for tracking activity and rewarding merit
    - We don‚Äôt want to incentivize low value contributions (e.g., only saying ‚Äúgm‚Äù)
    - Make it easy to off-board
</aside>

**Context:**

We need to determine:

1. Whether we need to / How do we track activity in Dream DAO?
    - What we did last season was the membership renewal (attend the LT and engage with the proposal.
    - If builder stop engaging it means they drop off, but champions are just having periods of inactivity due to work (+ they‚Äôve purchased a skywalker to get the membership)
    - May be helpful to keep the membership renewal for Champions.
    - There should be some way for people to renew their intention to be a Mentor/WG member.
        - Contact champions who are not active and ask if they want to keep the role.
        - Maybe we should reach out only in cases where people seem like they are dropping off.
        - Ask 1 mid-season Q to everybody: what did you do in the last 3 months in web3 to get updates from champions (keep it open that they don‚Äôt have to answer too elaborately)
            - Good approach + we can find unexpected useful solutions they‚Äôre working on
        - How do we determine who ‚Äúseems to be dropping off?‚Äù?
            - May ask everybody because it‚Äôs hard to determine them
2. How members, namely Builders and Champions (and possibly HODLers), move through the DAO?
    1. Alumni System for builders didn‚Äôt really work out. Why?
        - 

1. Champions:
    1. Should they have a requirement to become/remain one? 
    2. Can they be offboarded back into HODLers in case of being not active enough?
    3. 
    

1. Builders:
    1. Do we have a clear decentralized onboarding pipeline?
        1. Maybe a DAO-wide Ranked choice vote can help with that?
            1. Default - stewards reviewing it (because 50 apps is a lot to share with the DAO)
    2. How would you envision this system working out for them

**Open Questions:**

- Should we replace the current membership renewal process with this new question?
    - Yes
- Do we even need to partner with Community WG OR will it create excessive operational tension, thus unnecessarily stretching the project?
    - Community Building can help with the execution, distributing the questions to everyone (not just those we think are inactive)
        - +1
- If we do need to partner with the other WG, how would you envision it?
- How often should we ask this?
    - Twice a season (in the beginning and the middle of it)

### Conclusion:

- We should update the membership renewal process according to the thoughts expressed today
    - Ask 1 mid-season and 1 end-season question to everybody: 
    **what did you do in the last 3 months in web3?** to get updates from champions (keep it open that they don‚Äôt have to answer too elaborately)
        - Good approach + we can find unexpected useful solutions they‚Äôre working on
    - Should be same/similar Qs for both the Builders and Champs, as some people might be busy at one time, and more active another time.
    - We should more of reach out to them as people rather than simple membership renewal
    - Community WG can help with the execution, distributing the questions to everyone and getting their responses (not just those we think are inactive)
        - +1

## Tasks:

- Update the Elections key results to use Paperform to vote instead of the new web3 tool
    - Need an election person (will prob spend just a few hours on this)
    - Need five people to double-check the results
- Double-check the badge designs - Madison
- [BOUNTY] Update the membership renewal process, create a one-pager on this - $20
- Merit System should start at the end of the month

## **Next meeting ideas:**
