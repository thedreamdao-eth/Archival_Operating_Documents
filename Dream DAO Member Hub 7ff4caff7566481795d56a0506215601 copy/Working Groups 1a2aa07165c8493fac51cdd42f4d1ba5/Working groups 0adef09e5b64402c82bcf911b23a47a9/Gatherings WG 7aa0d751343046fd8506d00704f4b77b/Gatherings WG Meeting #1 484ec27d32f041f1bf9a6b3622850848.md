**The main part of our todayâ€™s meeting!** 

Thoughts & Ideas:

- [OKR Draft](https://www.notion.so/Gatherings-Working-Group-OKRs-Draft-0615f08f11fd4d009546c23bf4901524?pvs=21)
- Integration Sessions
- Conferences- The next steps

## Notes:

WG- Working Group

KR- Key Result

- Due to the merge of the Community Building and Gatherings WGs, the OKRs are split into 2 categories; community & trips/conferences; to meet 1 overarching objective.
- Gatherings had been done before in the last Season and Joshua had laid a very good framework for organizing trips so Iâ€™m just gonna work on some improvements and adjustments to be made
- The biggest factor in accomplishing these KRs for Gatherings is time and being able to work quickly.
- The next objective for community building would be to increase engagement and improve the â€˜Builder Experienceâ€™. Last Season, we witnessed a drop in engagement with members. In fact, most members dropped within the first month or so of the Season.
- Feedback was received from Builders that they often felt lost or didnâ€™t know what they were supposed to do as a Dream DAO Builder.
- 5 KRs for conferences.
- KR 1 would be to research conferences that Builders can attend. Builders in the DAO are new to Web3, so we have to make sure that the conferences we pick are ones that enrich their experiences as in the Web3 space and are beginner friendly. We have to be very intentional with our choices
- The conferences should take place from mid-March onwards so that international Builders have time to apply for Visa and hear back.
- Create a database for the conferences for comparing different factors
- KR 2 is to make an application process thatâ€™s easy to complete. The application shouldnâ€™t be lengthy, but it should be able to assess the Builderâ€™s intentions, interest, whether they see the conferences as a learning experience, etc. We need to be able to pick people that are good representatives of the DAO
- The Devcon application questions sounded the same but they assessed different things so maybe having shorter questions that are easier to answer but that also assess the Builderâ€™s intentions.
- KR3 is to help with docs. required for travel. Builders should be aware of what docs are required and be in the process of acquiring them within a set timeframe. For under 18 Builders, there should also be a permission slip that should be signed.
- Biggest factor in accomplishing all the KRs is being able to complete tasks by a set deadline within s set timeframe.
- Chaperones should be background checked. Thereâ€™s an already established Chaperone Policy doc. that should be put to good use.
- Buildersâ€™ contact and emergency contacts should be noted.
- KR4 is to prepare for the conferences. We should research events within the conferences, sign up for them, what fits the DAOâ€™s mission and Buildersâ€™ interests
- KR5 is after weâ€™ve completed KRs 1-4, we can successfully say that weâ€™ve sent Builders off. Thereâ€™s definitely more to this KR, and for now itâ€™s just vaguely put out. Somethings that may fall under this KR are making Learning Artefacts, documenting conference experiences, hosting LTs, putting the connections theyâ€™ve made at events to use, etc.
- Community Events is one of the trickier ones as we have to flow with what the community wants and what the people want.
- KR1 is recommended. Itâ€™s better to try to get everyone on the same page on what the DAOâ€™s mission is and really get to the core of it. Many Builders reported feeling confused on what their journeys are as Builders, which is fine but when they were picking out their working groups, they had a different expectation about what the WG are and what they are working towards
- KR2 is increasing the networking and connection value like meeting new people and champs and people who have similar interests. We have already seen with the bootcamp that many Builders have similar interests, but we can take it up a notch by Twitter spaces. Even with previous LT sessions that Builders enjoyed and have them on for Twitter Spaces, cuz itâ€™s where youâ€™ll find a larger audience and have greater exposure to the Web3 space.
- Rebeca has sent out an email to see what Builders think of Study Sessions
- Further improve mentorship program so that there are better outcomes, more accountability, maybe a LA to record the experiences of Builders. Last Season, we kicked off the mentorship program, but we didnâ€™t know what happened in the end so hopefully this time, we improve it to make outcomes more tangible.
- KR3 is to increase the social + fun value of events where we can have community hangouts that donâ€™t have a Web3 theme to it. Another way I can put out there for people to meet new folks in the community is Intros.ai, which Iâ€™ll put out in the Integration Sessions.
- KR4 is to increase engagement by surveying Builders and asking them if what the DAO has offered has met their expectations and what we can do to help
- Making the unplugging and re-plugging easier. Not sure of this cuz we ask members to renew their membership each Season now, so it might not be needed
- KR5  is to increase the Web3 educational value in events. S3 Builders reported that they felt like the sessions werenâ€™t interactive enough and they wished that speakers would speak about the concept behind their projects, rather than their projects themselves, so improving on the sessions is important.
- Integrations sessions: 2 part sessions that explains the ins and outs of the DAO.
- As people went through the bootcamp, questions started to arise. From questions like, â€˜What are Working Groups?â€™ to â€˜Why do we take decisions in the form of proposals?â€™
- Harry: We can get Champions to state the number of hours and give them more structure so they know what they are signing up for.
- I feel like there should be more concrete roles for Champions, like they should be able to commit at least an hour per week, whether itâ€™s mentoring Builders, giving them resources, etc. unless they wanna be more involved
- This is so that when Champions buy a SkywalkerZ, they understand that this is their way of giving value to the DAO and this is how theyâ€™ll be valued as a member; cuz it seems like they just â€˜existâ€™
- Harry: LT sessions are key improvements to, and we have to bring on better speakers and be careful that the speakers donâ€™t shill their projects
- Harry: Have expectations made clear to Champions for the mentorship program. When we get Champs in, it doesnâ€™t mean that they have to have time to contribute. The SkywalkerZ are a way of them showing monetary support and it shouldnâ€™t be necessary for them to contribute.
- We can start by reaching out to Champs who renewed their bandwidth this Season, so that we know if theyâ€™re interested in the mentorship. This is so we know if we need to opt for a different way to carry out the mentorship program, ex.: Junto style
- Harry: About the LT improvements, I think they can be improved in terms of interaction as itâ€™s supposed to be a 2 way conversation. We need to  get better speakers, even if it means that the WG are actively looking for speakers. We also need to be wary of people coming to us for the LTs to talk about their projects without realizing that these sessions are meant to educate our young Builders. This can be discussed with Charlotte.
- Integration sessions are made to provide detailed info about the DAO so that Builders have a better understanding of its inner-workings and so they find it easier to get involved
- So far thereâ€™s a bounty for these sessions and theyâ€™ll be selected tomorrow
- As for conferences, we should start looking for conferences now but thereâ€™s a set criteria in mind like choosing conferences in a country where itâ€™s a tiny bit easier for internationals to get a Visa
- In the Gatherings Working Group channel, people agreed that ETH Istanbul and ETH Tokyo
- The only reason these could be our picks is a) the time at which they take place b) Itâ€™ll maybe be easier to get a Visa but itâ€™s still uncertain
- We should start looking for options and get this going ASAP so that thereâ€™s more time to work on documents.
- Tarun and Bhavesh maybe can start
- Within the next meeting we can get stuff going or maybe async
- Harry: Would be good to have diversity of interest amongst Builders like the ones who are more technical can work together and the creatives can come together and it can really set us up for hackathons.
- Tarun: Consider ETH Paris as one of the options
- Could be hectic to get Visa but itâ€™s best to keep our options open!
- Get in touch with your bootcamp group and ask them if they have questions so that I know where to steer the info sessions content. Donâ€™t just survey them, really have a convo with them to assess what theyâ€™d like to see.
- For the community side of things, would having a â€˜divide and conquerâ€™ approach help so that people feel more heard? Similar to the bootcamp and the buddies. May help in assessing their needs easier.
- Harry: That could be too rigid to constantly check on them and expect output. Would be difficult to put people as points of contact witout bounties. What could help are getting the study sessions going. Itâ€™s more organic and natural.
- How Builders feel about the DAO can probably assessed after the info sessions, right now things are still unclear.
- Do you all think weâ€™d benefit from a timeline of the projects? Yes.

## Tasks

- Reach out to Champions to check availability, bandwidth, etc. to assess the next steps for the mentorship program
- Look for conferences that align with the DAO â€”> Make database
- 

## **Next meeting ideas:**

- Bounty update
- Reaching out to Champions update
- Conferences update
- Make application template so that when we finalize those conferences, we can send those out immediately
