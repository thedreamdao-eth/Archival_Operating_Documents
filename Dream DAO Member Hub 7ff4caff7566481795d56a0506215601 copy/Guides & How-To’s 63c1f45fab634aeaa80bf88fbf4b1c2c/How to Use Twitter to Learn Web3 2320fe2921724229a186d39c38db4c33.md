üí°¬†*How to get started on leveraging Twitter as a resource for learning about and immersing yourself within the budding world of web3!*

## **Why is Twitter valuable?**

*The myriad impacts of engaging with a Twitter feed*

- **Education** - Learning from the most knowledgable and respected thought-leaders driving the development of web3. These web3 communities are built on sharing and connecting, and their leaders and evangelists want to share what they learn, whether it be just the current news of the day or something more practical, like a [guide to best practices for nft security.](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1461742366696652809?lang=en) Learn from the communities by joining the conversation and jumping into the content
- **Networking** - There are tons of incredible people on Twitter who can support your personal and professional journey in the web3 space. Use Twitter to connect with communities, organizations, and individuals to further your development in the world of web3. Many of you Builders will find that your Champions and other Civics Unplugged funders are heavily active on Twitter, and this may in fact be the best environment through which to connect with them and learn about their work.
- **Personal Brand** -  Establish yourself as a real player on Twitter and in web3 by creating a following base of your own. Follow others, join live discussions, comment on interesting threads, direct message other individuals in the space, and most importantly publish your own thoughts about the web3 space. Twitter was designed to be a platform for dialogue and sharing, so... share! You will quickly find that many others in the space want to hear what you have to say.
- **Staying up-to-date** - web3 is CONSTANTLY changing (new legislation could come to light, new DAOs in the social space making waves, emerging / effective memes, new partnerships surfacing by the hour, etc.). Twitter can be used to easily stay up-to-date with real time updates / news, especially when your feed becomes web3-heavy... we tend to circulate updates at warp speed.
- **Different perspectives** - With any technological advancement, it‚Äôs important to see all perspectives of the good and the bad. Twitter is full of both - and even some neutral. Use Twitter to understand all perspectives on web3 in order to form your own educated opinion based on what you know and are hearing from all the players (users, builders, investors) in the space. But keep in mind: sometimes there are no right answers, just varying ideas across a spectrum.

## **Get Started / Tips for getting great feed**

*What should you do first*

- **Who to follow?** A great starting point here would be [this list of DreamerZ](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1473071000808046603) put together by @OliverYehlik. From there, you may want to peruse the ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù tabs of the people you have newly followed, observe with whom they tend to engage, and start following them yourself. Twitter will also begin serving up good recommendations as you begin interacting with the platform. Journalists, authors, and techies are particularly active sharing either information or ideas. If you see someone make an interesting comment - give them a follow! But feel free to make use of the unfollow feature as well. An effective Twitter feed is a living organism constantly in flux. This is healthy behavior. The more actively you curate your feed, the more value you will derive from usage. And if you have unfollowed someone who is actually worth following, chances are they will find their way back into your feed for you to reengage.
- **Topics** - One thing to keep in mind is that Twitter is itself constantly evolving as a software platform. Lately, the updates have pushed more toward a topics-driven feed, which makes for a more efficient onboard. If you want to learn about web3 - signing up for the web3 and/or NFT topics is a great place to start.
- **Spaces** - Once you have accrued some followers that you enjoy, start engaging with Spaces. Twitter Spaces are relatively new, a successful knockoff of Clubhouse, where users can set up on-the-fly audio rooms for panels, discussions, or AMAs. There is particularly heavy usage of Spaces in web3, and going into a Space (at the top of your Twitter feed) will not only expose you to interesting content, but  also give you access to audiences of potential follows. Speakers and listeners alike within certain Spaces can be an excellent pool of knowledge. Join / Share / Engage!
- **Who should you get notifications from?** Setting notifications can be especially useful in web3 Twitter (just click the button that looks like a bell at the top of someone‚Äôs profile!), where there is often an arbitrage on time in terms of engagement. If NFT collection is your fancy, setting alarms for new tweets from certain accounts is an absolute must, especially around a minting period. You also may want to set up notifications for @garysheng because he spits solarpunk fire on the daily.

## Allocate Time  ****

*How to manage your time on Twitter productively*

- **Set intention** - Map out what you want to learn by logging onto Twitter (this doesn‚Äôt need to be an entire exercise, but before aimlessly scrolling through Twitter feeds, have an idea of why you‚Äôre doing so in order to make the most out of your time... even if that idea is to intentionally scroll). Many an afternoon has been unknowingly burned on misallocated tweet binges.
- **Time blocking** - Block time periods during the day on your calendar dedicated to Twitter, and as always, be wary of nighttime phone access.
- **Reflections** - Reinforce learning by writing down what you learned, your thoughts on the topic, and maybe even **post your reflections + comment on the thread you found!**

## Keep In Mind - The Ugly of Twitter

- **Exercise restraint** - While Twitter was designed for dialogue and functions at its best when the replies are flying, this feature also serves as a potential pitfall. The psychology of engagement is tricky, and despite your best intentions when you get out of bed in the morning, you may absentmindedly find yourself stumbling into an argument with an anonymous troll account created two weeks ago with three followers. It can be difficult to prevent this from happening - but despite your best intentions, there is simply no good to come of it. DISENGAGE! THE BLOCK AND MUTE BUTTONS ARE YOUR FRIEND!
- **Be aware of FOMO** - Sadly, in the world of web3, where cool projects pop up left-and-right and accelerate like the millennium falcon, it is functionally impossible to stay abreast of the latest and greatest. You will watch others in your orbit garner successes you weren‚Äôt even aware were options - or, worse yes, **were** aware but chose not to participate. FOMO is very real, and it can cause a slew of reactions. Be mindful of it, make sure you are supporting others (the defining spirit of web3 is WAGMI - We All Gonna Make It - and that truly guides the budding community), and make sure it doesn‚Äôt lead you to make rash decisions.

## Accelerating Dream DAO on Twitter

*What you can do to use Twitter to scale the Dream DAO*

- Make sure to tag your fellow builders/champions and DreamDAO in any posts you make that are relevant to what we are trying to achieve!  This creates a positive feedback loop and will attract more attention to the DAO and the community.
- As you expand your Twitter network, don‚Äôt be afraid to comment on relevant Twitter posts and shout-out the DreamDAO!  Half the battle with getting traction is shining a light and visibility on great projects like ours.
- Even without mentioning DreamDAO specifically: Post / Share / Engage! You are a builder of the DAO, but the DAO itself is just a collection of things we want to build. So, your passions ARE DreamDAO‚Äôs passions. Your followers want to know what you think or see what you‚Äôre reading or hear what you‚Äôre listening to. Always remember, no platform is too small.  If you have something you are excited about, or think it would be a great post, don‚Äôt be afraid, just do it!  There are ways we can help elevate it and give it the oxygen it needs. And you will often find others you never expected might share your quirky passions and unlock a whole new community for you in which to thrive.
- It was said in the bullet above, but it can‚Äôt be said enough: Post / Share / Engage! If there is one thing that is consistently true across web3 platforms (Twitter included), it‚Äôs that being early and engaging is almost always rewarded, sometimes in the most unpredictable ways... even if that just means retweeting and tagging three friends for the chance at a random whitelist! We are all building this together; the benefits to holding back are rather slim.

**Happy learning!!!**
