# What is Worthy of Making into a Proposal (Criteria)

Creds to our amazing Champion ðŸ¥³Â **Carl Cervone:** 

## **New ideas should be turned into Proposals (with community voting) if one or more of the following criteria are true:**

**1/ Financial Impact.** The idea requires incremental funds or a reallocation of pre-approved funds.

**2/ Contributor Impact.** The idea requires a meaningful amount of time and effort from team members in order to be implemented.

**3/ Policy Impact.** The idea represents an amendment or a significant course correction to a "Dream Paper" or proposal that was previously approved by the community.

**4/ Community Impact.** The idea elicits dissenting views or a plurality of views from within the community and therefore isn't "obviously beneficial".

## **If a member feels an idea should be turned into a Proposal (and voted on), they should:**

- Make a comment in Discord along the lines of "I think this should be a Proposal because there appears to be some ___ Impact. Does anyone else agree?"
- **If their comment gets at least 3 emoji votes**, then the idea should be turned into a Proposal and voted on

## **If a member feels that a Proposal should just be fast-tracked (and not voted on), they should:**

- Make a comment in Discord along the lines of "I don't think this Proposal needs a vote because it's obviously beneficial and has no other impacts. Let me know if anyone feels otherwise."
- **If someone provides a meaningful justification for why it should be voted on, and gets 3 emoji votes, then the Proposal proceeds to a vote**
- Otherwise, the Proposal can just be fast-tracked without a vote
