# Designing a Template for Proposal to Bring a New Voting Member in

<aside>
ðŸš€ There are two kinds of voting members in the Dream DAO - 
â†’ The Builders, who are enthusiastic and talented GenZâ€™rs, typically 15 - 20 years old who act for the benefit of human flourishing. 
â†’ The Champions are established members from various industries who seed the Dream DAO by minting from our collection of NFTs known as â€˜Skywalkerzâ€™.

**There are different ways through which someone can become a voting member of the DAO. Below is a template of what one should consider if you want to nominate someone to be a champion or builder voting member!**

## What we look for in a voting member -

- Someone who embodies the spirit and enthusiasm of the community and the goal we are striving for - exploring the intersection of web3 Ã— social impact to benefit human flourishing.
- Someone who is willing to learn and actively participate and contribute to the DAO (builder), willing to mentor and help builders better understand web3 and crypto (champion).
- Someone who can contribute to the Dream DAO that and help us progress as an intergenerational COMMUNITY.
- Champions who are well-versed in the world of crypto and can mentor learners a.k.a. builders interested in learning about crypto and web3.

## **What questions should we be asking people to answer if they want to bring in a new voting member?**

- **Why does the nominator think this person will be a suitable voting member for the Dream DAO?**
    
    *Questions to consider when answering this question*
    
    - How will the person uniquely contribute to the DAO?
    - What prior experience does the person have in web3/blockchain? What about social impact?
    - How many hours per week can the nominee contribute to the Dream DAO?
    - Do they know the responsibilities and roles that come with the position?
    - Other than qualifications, what do you see in this person that makes you think they will make a good member of the community and Skywalker HODler?

These are some important aspects to consider when recommending/nominating someone to become a voting member of the Dream DAO.
