## Overview

During Season 2 of the Dream DAO, we onboarded 30 Builders and 20 Champions, bringing the total amount of Builders to 70 and Champions to 50 (*after also offboarding some Builders and Champions at the end of Season 1*). A good portion of these Builders and Champions are still engaged, but some are not. As we look to onboard more Voting Members during Season 3, we need to think about better ways to check the engagement of the community.

This Membership Renewal Process Document is the byproduct of the member mobility discussion of the 12th meeting of the Governance WG. This document aims to delve into that process to improve the engagement of Builders and Champions.

## How it works?

- We will ask one mid-season and one end-season question to all the Builders and Champions: ***what did you do in the last three months in web3?***
This question can be edited for Builders and Champions- for Builders, this question can be more specific but for champions, this question will be more open so that they don’t have to answer too elaborately.
    - The gist of the question will be about general engagement in web3 over the course of 3 previous months, but the question can be drafted differently for Builders and Champions, e.g.-
        - how are you? what did you do in the last three months in the Dream DAO (or web3)? (for Builders)
        - how are you? what did you work on in the last three months in web3? (for Champions)
- Another important update in this process is to reach out to the lesser active Builders and Champions 1:1. This will not simply be for membership renewal/offboarding but to mainly talk and understand their position about the Dream DAO and then mutually decide on renewal/offboarding.
- The Governance WG will be responsible for the execution of this process. It will distribute the questions to *everyone* (not just to those we think are inactive) *in the beginning and the end of a season* and record their responses.

## Why is this important?

The whole idea is that the voting members should be active, as we want contributors of the DAO to drive decisions that help the DAO move forwards and steer in the right direction. If a person is not active in the DAO at all for any season (which is exactly why we have two membership renewal checks), it is not completely fair if they come and vote on something that developed in this DAO over a whole season. 

This may be especially harming to the elections, as previously inactive people will be pulled back into the DAO because of the many election announcements and simply vote for their friends from 6 months ago, instead of trying to understand if it's really the best option based on the current season's performance and contributions.

## Important points

- The updated membership renewal process will ensure that this process not only acts as a way to get updated about builders/champions but will also act as a reminder for members to engage/re-engage with the DAO.
- We don’t have to worry as much about activity levels of Champions since they are not only voting members but also donors (by purchasing the NFT, they have funded the DAO). Even if they are less active, they might be doing something impactful in web3, so having non-active Champions is not a problem. However, we should still reach out to them on a 1:1 basis to check in on them. This will help us get an update on their work, but more more importantly re-engage them in the DAO.
- In season 2, some of the new builders were inactive and it’s important to reach out to them with the intention of renewal / offboarding to understand their position about the DAO and web3 in general and then deciding if they want to continue!
