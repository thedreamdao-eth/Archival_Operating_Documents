# Dream DAO Bounties Guide

## What are Bounties?

Bounties are small, one-off tasks that are taken on by one builder or a group of builders. Bounties can be posted by the Coordination Wizard, Working Group Leads, recurring roles, and, occasionally, other voting members of the DAO. To take on the bounty a builder must reply to the bounty message to show interest.

## Types of Bounties

There are two types of bounties in the Dream DAO-

**1) DAO-wide bounties:** 
these bounties are generally posted by co-stewards, the coordination wizard, or recurring-role builders (to help them out if they can't do a certain thing at that time) and these are open to any builder in the Dream DAO. A builder must respond to the bounty message to show interest.

**2) Working Group bounties:** 
these bounties are generally posted by the Working Group lead in the working group channel/meeting and can be taken on by a builder of that particular working group. The selected builder must communicate with the Working Group lead to finish the task in the stipulated time-frame.

## Reward Range of Bounties

A typical bounty in the Dream DAO is $20 and is paid in USDC. All bounties are paid at the end of each month. However, depending on the length of the task, the time commitment required, and context, bounties in the Dream DAO have a wide reward range.

Bounties can be as little as $5 USDC all the way up to $750 USDC. A very small task requiring minimal time will be generally posted as a $5 / $10 bounty. A huge task that requires a huge time commitment, research, and coordination will be posted as a $100 / $200 / $500 / $750 bounty (depending on time and work). Both these types of bounties are rare but the most common bounties are for $20 and posted ~3 times/wk.
