# How to Propose an idea in the community

1. **BRAIN DUMP:** Create a brain dump document that articulates what it is that you want to design, how it adds value to the Dream DAO, some rough ideas of how you might turn it into reality, and a listing of 1 or more other ideas that could achieve the same goals
    1. Feel free to add the document in this hub: [https://cucrew.notion.site/96c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae?v=98cac6468e03420dbf242a9a7e683378](../Design%20Documents%20&%20Braindumps%2096c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae.md)
2. **GET FEEDBACK FROM COMMUNITY:** Share the brain dump in a new Thread you create in the [Ideas and Proposals](https://discord.com/channels/896096170621947974/897254266698367038) channel in our Discord. The Thread can be called something like [DISCUSS] <Insert Idea Name>
3. **EVALUATE + DECIDE:** Given the feedback, what do you want to do-
Integrate the feedback? 
Drop the idea, or
Put it on hold until a better time (if there is a need to prioritise something else)?

4. Only if you decided to move forward with this work at this time, flesh out the Brain Dump into a Design Doc! Or if the idea is super simple and requires a DAO vote (see [What is Worthy of Making into a Proposal (Criteria)](What%20is%20Worthy%20of%20Making%20into%20a%20Proposal%20(Criteria%205309ef89b8564f4094bdb400100f61f6.md)), feel free to start a Governance Proposal!
5. Only if your idea needs a governance proposal, create a Governance Proposal here: [](../Governance%20Proposals%205d412cf3fc7743baaa779bd95bf06dc5/Governance%20Proposal%20Database%2053c301529577431d8754784c804b4dfc.md)
