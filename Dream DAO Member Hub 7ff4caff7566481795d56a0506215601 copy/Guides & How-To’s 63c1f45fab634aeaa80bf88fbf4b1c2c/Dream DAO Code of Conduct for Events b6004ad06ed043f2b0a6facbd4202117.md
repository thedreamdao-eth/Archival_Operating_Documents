# Dream DAO Code of Conduct for Events

We aim to make each Dream DAO meeting a welcoming space for everyone. We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religious beliefs, or scientific opinion. We do not tolerate harassment in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue this event will be held in, whether physical or virtual.

Harassment may include but is not limited to:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or technology choices;
- Sexual language and images in any event platform;
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following;
- Harassing photography or recording;
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events;
- Inappropriate direct messaging contact;
- Inappropriate sexual attention;
- Uninvited physical touch, e.g. hand on shoulder;
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the space a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the event.

Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities, including both physical and virtual events, meetings and calls.If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, or if you have any other concern, please report it to DAO Steward Gary Sheng ([gary@civicsunplugged.org](mailto:gary@civicsunplugged.org)). Reports will be handled in strict confidence.
