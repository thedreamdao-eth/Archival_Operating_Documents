### How to Create a Discussion

1. **Pick a topic** 

Topics for discussions must be related to web3 x social impact, and we prioritize topics that fill a gap/need in current web3 content.  

1. **Create an overview document** 

The speaker will create a 1-3 page document that summarizes the topic. This document will be required pre-reading for the discussion. The document should be concise and educational yet thought-provoking. It should include any technical definitions, but it can also include the speaker’s opinions and/or personal experiences. 

## Phase 2: Host Lecture 🧑‍🏫

---

<aside>
🗣️ Lectures are live presentations that end with a Q&A. 

**Phase objective: Package the collective knowledge into presentable content.**

### How to Create a Lecture

The speaker will create a presentation that synthesizes the content from their overview document and the discussion. [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ACu9D9P9R9JO832UF1JSe6vK7kOypPhD5Tx0qgcDz38/edit?usp=sharing) is an example of a presentation. 

We recommend that each presentation includes: 

- An overview/roadmap
- Definitions for technical terms
- Additional resources

## Phase 3: Create Educational Content 📖

<aside>
🗣️ After completing a discussion and lecture, the speaker will produce a public-facing piece of educational content on the topic. The content can be in the medium the speaker prefers (article, video, lecture, document, etc). 

**Phase objective: Add new, valuable, high quality content to the web3 x social impact ecosystem.**

### How to Create the Educational Content

The speaker can create the content in the medium of their choice (article, video, lecture, document, etc). 

The content should be created in a way that makes it accessible to anyone who wants to learn about the topic, (which means defining any technical terms). The content should explain why it was created and the iterations it went through in the discussion and lecture.
