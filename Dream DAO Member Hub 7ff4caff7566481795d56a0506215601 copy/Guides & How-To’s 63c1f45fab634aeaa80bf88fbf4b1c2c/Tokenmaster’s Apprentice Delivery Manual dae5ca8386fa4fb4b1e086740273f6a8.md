# Tokenmaster’s Apprentice Delivery Manual

### ***"I used to be a builder like you, then I took POAP delivery as a task" — The Tokenmaster***

(Please read it in an old man’s voice and throw in your suggestions as comments haha) 

...

Well, stranger, if you came here, then you probably have something you want to know, something to learn from an old Tokenmaster. Come show me...

- Oh, Ape Almighty! I haven’t seen those runes in years!

Uh, I see... You’ve been told to deliver those tokens, the POAPs! So, you probably want to know what do you have to do with them, right? Come, come, my dear. Follow along!

...

<aside>
❗ No-no-no, it’s not “Pope”. Say it with me: “Poh-ap”, ha-ha, yes, like that!

</aside>

I bet you wonder what this thing even is, ain’t ya? Oh, I see, listen:

The POAP is... well, what you really need to know is that it’s a magical artifact, one of those NFTs, but a special one. Its purpose is to record life experiences, so people like me can look back at them one day and wonder what a journey it was! POAPs can also be used to prove that you’ve attended a certain gathering: any fair, lecture, or giveaway.

Now, when that’s been made clear, let’s move to the practical part:

Firstly, my dear, you create a table to list all of the receivers. Here’s what it should look like:

[An old document](Tokenmaster%E2%80%99s%20Apprentice%20Delivery%20Manual%20dae5ca8386fa4fb4b1e086740273f6a8/An%20old%20document%20e5b303fc1aef4bcca5e43905ed346016.csv)

You will have to fill in the lucky ones’ Twitter handle, POAP link, and tick a couple of boxes if they are following us and if you’ve messaged them. *Yes-yes, all manual labor!* 

I advise you to recheck the links 3 days prior to the claiming deadline and choose if the link is “Received” or has to be “Rearranged”, so you can reassign the unused links to the people who sign up later/experience an error of some sort. **Oh, you better do that**! *Angry and impatient, they will swarm ya, my dear, and they will be typing in rage: “where poap”, “give poap”, or in despair: “I guess I won't be able to poap”, so you better be prepared.* 

*Also, there might be ancient POAP bots lurking in the dark corners of your DMs, so look out for some suspicious messages/accounts.*

Then, go to the tweet’s replies section, and start copying the links and putting them in the table! 

<aside>
❗ Remember, **if they are following - we DM (”Hey there! Here’s your POAP+link”), if not - we leave “Hey there! Please make sure to follow us to be eligible for your POAP” under their reply (it’s better to seek their reply in the “Tweets & replies” section of their profile)**

</aside>

I would recommend ya to like the replies you have already listed, just to eliminate unnecessary rechecks!

It might take around a week to deal with 400-500 **POAPs**, but they **are usually sent in waves.**

And be aware, my dear, that you will have to answer their questions in twitter, so keep an eye on your DMs.

Oh, and keep in mind! This manual is not end-all be-all, but rather a set of main steps to follow. 

*You might use a variety of Notion features as per your own understanding and vision!*

### *See you in the Solarpunk future, my apprentice!*

📝 Main steps (for easier reference):

</aside>

1. Create a table for a tweet 
2. Put there the receivers’ Twitter links (by scrolling through the replies of the tweet, yes-yes, all manual labor), the POAP links, and ticks if they are following/are messaged.
3. Recheck if all of them got their links 3-5 days prior to the claiming deadline
4. Choose “Received” (if received haha) or “Rearrange”(if the link has to be reassigned) in the table
