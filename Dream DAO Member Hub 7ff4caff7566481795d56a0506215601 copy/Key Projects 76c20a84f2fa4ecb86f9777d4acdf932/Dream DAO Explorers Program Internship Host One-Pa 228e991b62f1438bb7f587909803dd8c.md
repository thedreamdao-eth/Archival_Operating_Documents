- It‚Äôs hard for a Gen Zer to start contributing to an inspiring web3 org without a warm introduction to the org / web3 space, and prior work experience. Dream DAO aims to solve this by providing Gen Zers with training, funding, and network, so they can get their first web3 internship, gain confidence in their abilities, and take on new challenges to improve the world!
- At Dream DAO, we believe that the best way to learn web3 is not to simply consume literature and lectures about it, but to actualy dive head-first into the space, learning and adapting while new things are happening around you. To make this experience easier to handle, we offer mentorship from experienced web3 leaders and access to learning resources to fill knowledge gaps, but overall our builders seem to achieve the best learning results while building the plane they are already flying.

### About the Dream DAO ‚ÄúExplorers‚Äù (the Gen Zers we want to start contributing to regen web3)

---

**Web3 is an ever-growing space where new breakthroughs happen every day because of the ambitious ideas of the community. This is a space of initiative, and initiative requires an adventurous spirit, courage, and modern vision. The younger generation embodies these attributes and provides an optimistic, creative outlook toward society.** 

*But how do we get young people who have the motivation, skills, and bandwidth to help us build the web3 space?*

Dream DAO Explorers are young civic-minded builders who have shown their commitment to making a change by starting campaigns, organizations, and initiatives. The Builders are hand-selected by the Dream DAO community after deliberation and discourse.

They are supported by our Dream DAO ‚Äú**Champions**,‚Äù who are experts in adjacent fields and provide the wisdom and values for success.

- They have shown evidence of their work ethic, ability to execute, and sharpness of thinking.
- For being part of the program, they expressed interest and commitment to make an impact.

Our builders are already doing great things in different disciplines. They are a diverse group of individuals who have different thought processes, which is their superpower and allows them to see across the landscape and incorporate different views and mindsets.
