📌 **Here you can find the curations of resources to understand the basics of Web3 x Social Impact:**

### **Understand concepts such as blockchain, Bitcoin, and Ethereum.**

The most important topics to check it out, for now:

1. **[What is web3?](https://www.odysseydao.com/articles/what-is-web3)**
2. **[What is blockchain?](https://www.odysseydao.com/articles/what-is-blockchain)**
3. **[What is Bitcoin?](https://www.odysseydao.com/articles/what-is-bitcoin)**
4. **[What is Ethereum?](https://www.odysseydao.com/articles/what-is-ethereum)**

### **Key Properties for Social Impact in web3:**

- Decentralised - no centralized decision making body
- Trustless - no need for middlemen and rent-seeking
- Transparent - everything is recorded, public and immutable
- Permissionless - anyone can participate.
- Interoperable - blockchains are typically built to interoperate with each other.
- Composable - applications can build on top of each other like lego-blocks

Every Social Impact web3 project has these categories in its core elements.
