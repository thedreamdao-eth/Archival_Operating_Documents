Why you would succeed in the role : As this bootcamp onboards new people into Web3, well-facilitated sessions are key to ensuring a positive start to the world of Web3 where people feel welcomed and they have a sense of direction in the space. I not only have the experience, but also the time commitment that this role requires. Some of my experience includes:

-Co-hosting the graduation event for the Civics Unplugged Fellowship
-Co-facilitating the Season 2 builder hangout in DreamDAO where I interacted with the new buildersÂ 
-Co-facilitated the Web3xSocial Impact Fundamentals Learning Together session where I talked about a Web3xSocial Impact project that advocated for abortion rights
-Co-hosted an event that introduced the Civics Unplugged fellows to Web3 and how it can intersect with social impact.
-Facilitated the Devcon Discussion Learning Together session

Along with my variety of experiences, I also have the qualities that are required of a facilitator such as leadership, enthusiasm, great people skills and communication skills, and being really interactive and making sure that everyone is included in a discussion and can safely put their thoughts and questions forward, which is important when trying to bring young people into unfamiliar spaces such as Web3 and I believe that this opportunity will help me get better at it and will be a learning experience for me not only for my self-development, but also my Web3 knowledge.
