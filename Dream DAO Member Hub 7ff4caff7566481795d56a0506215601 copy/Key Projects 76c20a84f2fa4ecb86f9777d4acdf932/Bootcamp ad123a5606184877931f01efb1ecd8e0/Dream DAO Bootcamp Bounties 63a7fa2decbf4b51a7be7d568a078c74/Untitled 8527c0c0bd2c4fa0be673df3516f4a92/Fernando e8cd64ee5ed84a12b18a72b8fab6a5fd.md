Why you would succeed in the role : First of all, during the entire month of January, I will be on my inter-semester vacation period from the University, so without a doubt, I will be able to cover the hours required to carry out the activities of the Bootcamp facilitator. Likewise, I consider myself an outgoing and active person both on Discord in general and on my respective Working Group channels. In the same way, I consider myself suitable to be part of the facilitator role since I have had the opportunity to facilitate academic sessions, debates, as well as presentations on specific topics at University, I have also had the opportunity to facilitate on multiple occasions the Learning Together Sessions that are carried out in Dream Dao for what I consider I can achieve the activities exposed for this role. Personally, I think that despite being a recent builder of Dream Dao season 2, I probably don't have a deep knowledge of all the things related to Web3 and what surrounds it, but I feel that being part of this role suits me to allow me to learn more along the way, either in the Bootcamp or on my own, so I would commit me to prepare myself as necessary to be able to perform the facilitator role in the Bootcamp in the best possible way. Finally, I would like to add that this opportunity would be something incredible to be able to establish connections with the new builders that are integrated into season 3, as well as to be able to reinforce the connections with those builders from the old seasons and also that they can be able to achieve, like me, they can feel identified and interested with Web3 and all that it can offer.
