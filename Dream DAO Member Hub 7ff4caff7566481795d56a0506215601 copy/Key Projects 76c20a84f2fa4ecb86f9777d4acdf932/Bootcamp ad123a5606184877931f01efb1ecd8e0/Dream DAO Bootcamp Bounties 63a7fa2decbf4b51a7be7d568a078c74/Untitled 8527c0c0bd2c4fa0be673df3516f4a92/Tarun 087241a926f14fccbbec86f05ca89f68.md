Why you would succeed in the role : I do not have any commitments in January, so I can even give more than expected number of hours. I am also active on discord most of the times. I like to interact with new young builders and help as much as possible to know them about Dream DAO and Web3 so that they do not feel any discomfort once they join the program.
