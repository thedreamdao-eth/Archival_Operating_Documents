Why you would succeed in the role : I’m interested in becoming a facilitator of the bootcamp because I can understand and relate with how web3 can be intimidating and challenging to understand in the beginning. Because I had to learn the concepts through research and trial and error, I would like to take part in making web3 more accessible to learn and understand. I’ve been involved with Dream DAO as a Founding Builder with activities that range from being a Learning Together Twitter Recap Thread Writer, community building efforts, Explorers Program, and etc. I believe that my experience as an LT Thread writer allows me to have the ability to simplify web3 concepts for beginners. Additionally, I do have teaching experience from being a Campus Workshop Facilitator for Kode With Klossy, where I taught the fundamentals of web development to teen girls.
