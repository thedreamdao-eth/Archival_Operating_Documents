Why you would succeed in the role : I have the time availability and desire to be the facilitator! 
Besides having the capacity and technical skills to lead the bootcamp, I'm even more interested in the outcome, in terms of how to integrate the new builders and the ecosystem of the Dream DAO. So, I will be more than a facilitator, but a thinking partner on how to create and catalyze a place of connection, collaboration, and contribution.
