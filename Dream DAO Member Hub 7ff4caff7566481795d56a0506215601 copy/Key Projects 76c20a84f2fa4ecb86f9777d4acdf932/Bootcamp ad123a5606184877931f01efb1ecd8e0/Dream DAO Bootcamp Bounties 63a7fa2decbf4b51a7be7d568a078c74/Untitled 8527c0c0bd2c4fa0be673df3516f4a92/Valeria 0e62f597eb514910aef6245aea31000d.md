Why you would succeed in the role : I have some experience in facilitating networking sessions for the Global Changemakers team, when I was an outreach volunteer, and leading the meetings with my team in my social project GIS. My background in web3 is not vast at all, but it would be a rewarding experience to relearn some terms and concepts alongside the new builders and helping them to feel like they belong to this community through some icebreakers and online tools.
