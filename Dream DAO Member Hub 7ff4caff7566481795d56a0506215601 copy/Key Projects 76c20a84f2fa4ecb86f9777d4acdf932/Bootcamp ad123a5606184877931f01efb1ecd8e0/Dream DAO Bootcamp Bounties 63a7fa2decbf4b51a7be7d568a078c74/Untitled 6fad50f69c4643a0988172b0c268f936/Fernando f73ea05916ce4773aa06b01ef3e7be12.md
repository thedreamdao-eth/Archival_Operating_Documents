Why you would succeed in the role : During the entire month of January, I will be on my inter-semester vacation period from University, so I will undoubtedly be able to cover the hours required to carry out the activities of this role. As I already mentioned in the previous application, I consider myself an outgoing and active person both on Discord in general and in my respective Working Group channels, so I think I can be useful for the new builders of season 3 who participate in the Bootcamp. Also, I think this would be a great opportunity for us and for the builders that join Season 3 to be able to break the ice and be able to interact in order to build relationships that will help the DAO in future activities and projects. Finally, I think that this opportunity could help the builders to get closer to us, the buddies, and be able to support them in whatever they need to be able to carry out the Bootcamp in the most satisfactory way possible and, in this way, they can be able to perform in an incredible way in the Dao for which, I consider, I am a suitable person to be able to interact with the builders and to be able to establish relationships, as well as being a reference to which they can go in case they need help in the future within Dream Dao.
