Why you would succeed in the role : Being able to help welcome Builders to the bootcamp and the DAO will be a great privilege for me and the entire Dream DAO community as I would give 100% of myself to make them feel at home and get a sense of community in a short time so that they get excited to finish the bootcamp well and take advantage of all that Dream DAO has to offer.

I am available as I will be on holidays and it will be a great way to give back a lot of what Dream DAO has given me and there is no better way than to help with the new cohort of builders for Season 3 and their experience for the 3 weeks of the bootcamp.
