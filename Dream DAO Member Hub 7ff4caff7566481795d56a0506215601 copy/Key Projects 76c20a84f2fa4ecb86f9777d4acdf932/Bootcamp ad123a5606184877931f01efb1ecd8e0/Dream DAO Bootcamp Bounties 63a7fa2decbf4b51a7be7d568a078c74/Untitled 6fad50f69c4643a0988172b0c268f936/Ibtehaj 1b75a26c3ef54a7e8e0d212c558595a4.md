Why you would succeed in the role : Earlier in the season, I helped facilitate the Season 2 hangout where I helped Builders understand the DAO at large and ways they can get involved. I have experience in taking up roles where I welcome people, help them get accustomed with a community, answer questions and overall help them understand the role they play and the potential of the community and how it can serve them. I’ve also had experience co-hosting office hours, answering people’s questions countless times and condensing and simplifying information both verbally and in written form. I have the time commitment for this role and I’m very active on Discord, and as a member of the community building working group, I have the skills for this role and recognize the importance of making sure that the Builders can not only have a smooth onboarding, but they also understand the ins and outs of the community and how to get involved with ease.
