Why you would succeed in the role : - this is a two-way opportunity: where we as buddies get the chance to welcome new builders to the DAO and they get to interact and learn more about the DAO with current builders!
- I made an Intro to web3 beginner-friendly Learning Page for new builders to understand web3 from scratch and I also love to discuss and explain various topics about web3 with everyone! After being cryptopilled by Aditya way back in June ‘22, I’ve had great conversations with many people about the basics of web3!  
- I feel this is a great role for me as I am active on Discord and love to interact with and help people in whatever ways I can! I organized a https://www.notion.so/8726f74828dc4fffa90e0865306e25ae?pvs=21 session for all new season 2 builders in July ‘22 to meet, hangout and learn more about the DAO, and I would love to get the chance to do something similar with the new builders in S3!
