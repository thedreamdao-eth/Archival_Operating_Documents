Name,"Why you would succeed in the role "
Tarun,"I do not have any commitments in January, so I can even give more than expected number of hours. I am also active on discord most of the times. I like to interact with new young builders and help as much as possible to know them about Dream DAO and Web3 so that they do not feel any discomfort once they join the program."
"Valeria ","I have some experience in facilitating networking sessions for the Global Changemakers team, when I was an outreach volunteer, and leading the meetings with my team in my social project GIS. My background in web3 is not vast at all, but it would be a rewarding experience to relearn some terms and concepts alongside the new builders and helping them to feel like they belong to this community through some icebreakers and online tools."
Fernando,"First of all, during the entire month of January, I will be on my inter-semester vacation period from the University, so without a doubt, I will be able to cover the hours required to carry out the activities of the Bootcamp facilitator. Likewise, I consider myself an outgoing and active person both on Discord in general and on my respective Working Group channels. In the same way, I consider myself suitable to be part of the facilitator role since I have had the opportunity to facilitate academic sessions, debates, as well as presentations on specific topics at University, I have also had the opportunity to facilitate on multiple occasions the Learning Together Sessions that are carried out in Dream Dao for what I consider I can achieve the activities exposed for this role. Personally, I think that despite being a recent builder of Dream Dao season 2, I probably don't have a deep knowledge of all the things related to Web3 and what surrounds it, but I feel that being part of this role suits me to allow me to learn more along the way, either in the Bootcamp or on my own, so I would commit me to prepare myself as necessary to be able to perform the facilitator role in the Bootcamp in the best possible way. Finally, I would like to add that this opportunity would be something incredible to be able to establish connections with the new builders that are integrated into season 3, as well as to be able to reinforce the connections with those builders from the old seasons and also that they can be able to achieve, like me, they can feel identified and interested with Web3 and all that it can offer."
Shreya Devaram,"I’m interested in becoming a facilitator of the bootcamp because I can understand and relate with how web3 can be intimidating and challenging to understand in the beginning. Because I had to learn the concepts through research and trial and error, I would like to take part in making web3 more accessible to learn and understand. I’ve been involved with Dream DAO as a Founding Builder with activities that range from being a Learning Together Twitter Recap Thread Writer, community building efforts, Explorers Program, and etc. I believe that my experience as an LT Thread writer allows me to have the ability to simplify web3 concepts for beginners. Additionally, I do have teaching experience from being a Campus Workshop Facilitator for Kode With Klossy, where I taught the fundamentals of web development to teen girls. "
Rebeca Lissa,"I have the time availability and desire to be the facilitator! 
Besides having the capacity and technical skills to lead the bootcamp, I'm even more interested in the outcome, in terms of how to integrate the new builders and the ecosystem of the Dream DAO. So, I will be more than a facilitator, but a thinking partner on how to create and catalyze a place of connection, collaboration, and contribution.

Ibtehaj,"As this bootcamp onboards new people into Web3, well-facilitated sessions are key to ensuring a positive start to the world of Web3 where people feel welcomed and they have a sense of direction in the space. I not only have the experience, but also the time commitment that this role requires. Some of my experience includes:

-Co-hosting the graduation event for the Civics Unplugged Fellowship
-Co-facilitating the Season 2 builder hangout in DreamDAO where I interacted with the new builders 
-Co-facilitated the Web3xSocial Impact Fundamentals Learning Together session where I talked about a Web3xSocial Impact project that advocated for abortion rights
-Co-hosted an event that introduced the Civics Unplugged fellows to Web3 and how it can intersect with social impact.
-Facilitated the Devcon Discussion Learning Together session

Along with my variety of experiences, I also have the qualities that are required of a facilitator such as leadership, enthusiasm, great people skills and communication skills, and being really interactive and making sure that everyone is included in a discussion and can safely put their thoughts and questions forward, which is important when trying to bring young people into unfamiliar spaces such as Web3 and I believe that this opportunity will help me get better at it and will be a learning experience for me not only for my self-development, but also my Web3 knowledge."
