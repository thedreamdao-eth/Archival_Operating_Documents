# Regen Network Development, Inc.

Can pay >= $20 USD / hr?: Yes
Hrs per week: 20
Intern role: how-to guides, participate in ReFi community telegrams, engaging with our discord management, creativity around telling the stories of our community; we are flexible in our needs and the scale of contributions that make sense for DreamDAO memebers
Mentor on site?: we follow a 2 week sprint cycle, these folks would report to me, we would establish some clear scopes of activities where they would have a lot of freedom in developing drafts, and then our teams will work to provide them direction and feedback; it's a pretty build in public style within the company itself, so we all work together to ensure movement and support with work activities
