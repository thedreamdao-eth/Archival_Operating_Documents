Context: We can hire up to 2 builders at 10-15 hours each. Hourly commitment may vary week-to-week depending on the Builder’s interest/availability + availability of suitable tasks. 
Can pay >= $20 USD / hr?: Yes
Hrs per week: 25
Intern role: We primarily need help with workshop development and testing, communications, and operations-related tasks. Working on these tasks will equip builders with some of the tools they’ll need for their journeys in web3 x social impact, including knowledge and theoretical training as well as the technical tools for doing the work (Miro, Notion, etc).
Mentor on site?: Yes, at least two core team members (Gus, Saf) have indicated that they are available to act as mentors for the Builders we hire. This could involve weekly 1-1 check-ins, being available through DMs for any questions, and clearly defined tasks for builders to start with.

Why requesting intern?: As we continue to grow our efforts to spread the values of Good Growth, there are a number of areas our organization could use the help of brilliant young minds who are tuned into these same values. We also want to empower these builders to take these values with them to any future projects they choose to contribute to, to assist with the process of knowledge-sharing.
