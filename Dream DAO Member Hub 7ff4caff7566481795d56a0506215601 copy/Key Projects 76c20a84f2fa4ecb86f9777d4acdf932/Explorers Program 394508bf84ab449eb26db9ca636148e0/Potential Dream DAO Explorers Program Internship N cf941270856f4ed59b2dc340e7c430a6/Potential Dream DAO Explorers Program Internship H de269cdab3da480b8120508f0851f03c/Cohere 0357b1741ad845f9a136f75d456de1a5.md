Why requesting intern?: Cohere is all about movement-building. We are bringing together the leaders of today and tomorrow together to create new means through which we can live and grow together in right relations with the earth. Bringing in the insights of someone from the DreamDAO community would enable us to further connect with our ideal community of young leaders that are drawn to changing the world.
