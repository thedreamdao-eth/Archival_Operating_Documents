## Guidelines

---

We will be following several guidelines to keep everyone safe and happy at Devcon. If you have any questions about the guidelines, please ask one of the Chaperones: 

1. **[Most important] You must never travel anywhere alone.** 
    - To be safe, even for things like going to the bathroom, default to taking someone with you.
2. **Builders must be attended by 2/3 of the chaperones at all times** (unless we are split into groups, then the ratio can be 1 chaperone for every 3 Builders). 
    - This includes traveling from location to location and general areas of a location. For example, Builders cannot be on complete opposite sites of the convention center alone.
3. **Alcohol consumption is prohibited, even for attendees 18 and older.** 
    - In order to keep everyone safe and to avoid potentially unfavorable situations, alcohol consumption will be prohibited. We are also representing Dream DAO everywhere we go, so we need to be mindful of the image we are portraying in every setting.
4. **Builders will be in the hotel by 9pm.** 
    - When dinner wraps up, we will head back to the hotel and arrive by 9pm at the latest. Builders are free to meetup at the hotel but they are not permitted to leave.

We may develop more “guidelines” as a group as we go, but in general, remember to prioritize your safety in all situations, and remember that you are a representative of the Dream DAO! 

## Safety Tips

---

- No taxis

We will not be riding taxis, only Ubers to ensure safety. We have heard from locals that this is the best option. 

- Valuables

Do not “show off” any valuables- the means keeping your phone in your front pocket, not wearing expensive jewelry, not wearing crypto merch, and leaving valuables like your laptop at the hotel when possible. 

- Stay in groups

The more, the merrier! Stay in as large of groups as possible. 

## Life 360

---

We will be using Life360 to track everyone’s location. This is less of us trying to make sure you are where you are supposed to be- and more of a safety precaution. Madison will send the link soon and will turn hers on Thursday when she arrives, for her own safety.
