# The Dream DAO Explorers Program üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ

---

The **Dream DAO Explorers Program** (DDEP) is a **two-month internship program** for Dream DAO Builders who are looking to explore their interests in web3 and how web3 can be used to address social challenges. Participants do not have to be very tech-savvy but must be extremely committed to learning how to harness the power of decentralized systems to make a difference in the world.

So far, we‚Äôve run **2 successful cohorts** where over **20 Explorers** have gained experience working across companies including Celo, Climate Collective, LOA Labs, dORG, Aera Force and Protein.

***What are the ultimate objectives?***

- Advance web3 x social impact by empowering Dream DAO Builders to contribute to the missions of impactful web3 x social impact organizations
- Explorers contribute to the collective intelligence/knowledge of the Dream DAO, web3, and the world
- Elevate the exposure, support and funding of talented Gen Zers in the web3 space
- Help the Dream DAO Explorers advance their skillsets, profiles, and careers in web3

## How does the internship work? ü§î

---

### Part 1: Learning Through Experience

**Partnered Internship** 

- Explorers conducting an internship at a partner organization will...
    - Join/create a project at a partnered organization
    - Create KPIs with org mentor and DAO committee, ensuring work intent
    - Follow the org‚Äôs preferences for syncs and update the DAO committee with progress

### Part 2: Supporting Interns

Throughout the program...

- Each Explorer can meet twice a month with a ‚ÄòChampion‚Äô guide who will serve as an accountability partner and work with them to identify how the Dream DAO community can best support them.
- Each Explorer receives **career development training** and **personal development exercises** that align with their trajectory as an emerging web3 contributor.

This serves to support...

- The leadership development of the Explorer (helping them crystallize what they've learned, what they want to do and learn next, and identify what they might need help on)
- The collective intelligence of the Dream DAO community and the general public.

### Part 3: Share Insights

Once explorers gain sufficient knowledge and takeaways from their experience, they will construct **‚ÄúLearning Artifacts‚Äù** to benefit the community at large. 

- These artifacts can take many forms: an article, learning together session, vlog, video essay, and more.
- One will be created at the midpoint of the program, and another will be completed at the program‚Äôs conclusion.

At the program‚Äôs conclusion, the cohort of explorers will tackle a **capstone project**. 

- These projects can include an experimental feature, a learning resource, or an initiative that pushes the web3 x social impact space forward in some way.
- Capstone projects will be created by multiple explorers (possibly even the cohort as a whole) and crucially allow builders to learn by doing

Explorers will also submit feedback on the DDEP to better inform future iterations of the program. 

## **How are Explorers selected?** üëÜ

---

In each Season, there will be a call for applications and it happens in 3 stages:

1. Builders fill out an application form, showcasing their skills, experiences, and why are they interested in interning at a partner organization.
2. Hosts can submit an interest form, or be contacted by the Dream DAO Partnerships Team. The potential internship host will then be asked to share information about the role and skills they need the intern to have.
3. Dream DAO Core team will match Builders and Hosts accordingly to their needs and skills, so both get the best out of the program. 

Dream DAO commits to supporting both Explorers and Hosts with anything needed along the way.

## What are the intended outcomes of the Explorers Program? üí≠

---

### Individual Outcomes

Ultimately, each explorer should have a much clearer sense of their "You-Shaped Holes" in the world of web3 and social impact ‚Äî or if they are no longer interested in pursuing a career in this space. 

In addition, they should have...

- A much deeper understanding of how to leverage the power of web3 for social impact‚Äîwith internship experience and tangible projects to show for it
- Learned a lot about themselves (passions, talents, curiosities, how they think)
- Learned a lot about the world around them ‚Äî including macro trends and some of the greatest impediments to human flourishing at various scales
- Developed new skills that expand the number of careers they could pursue
- Built a much stronger network that can help them get to the next chapter in their leadership development journey ‚Äî whether that next chapter involves leveraging web3 or not

### Collective Outcomes

While the explorers will gain invaluable knowledge from the program, the Dream DAO community will also benefit from their journeys. 

The collective will...

- Learn from the capstone projects that Explorers create (which should be mutually beneficial for the builder and the org they partner with)
- Gain insight on how to improve the next Explorers Program and support more young people who want to enter the space
