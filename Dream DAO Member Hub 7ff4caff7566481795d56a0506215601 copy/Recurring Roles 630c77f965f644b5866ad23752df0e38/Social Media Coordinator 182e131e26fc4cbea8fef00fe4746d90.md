    Did you miss our Learning together number #68? Here is a sum up üßµ
    Dream DAO hosted a session on February 25th with Oliver Yehlik, a Founding Dream DAO Builder, who shared insights on Solarpunk. 
    
    Insight number 1 ‚òÄ 
    #Solarpunk is a vision of a sustainable future where technology and nature work in harmony to create a better world. It's about finding ways to harness the power of technology while also preserving the natural world we live in.
    
    Insight number 2 üë©‚Äçüåæ
    One of the key aspects of SP is the emphasis on the #collective impact of technology and sustainability. Instead of focusing only on individual actions, Solarpunk encourages us to think about how our actions can have a positive impact on the world as a whole.
    
    Insight number 3: 
    So what would a Solarpunk world look like? It would be a place where clean energy is abundant and accessible to everyone, where smart cities use technology to improve people's lives while also preserving green spaces and natural beauty. 
    It would be a #diverse and inclusive world, where counterculture enthusiasm is embraced and celebrated. And, perhaps most importantly, it would be a world that works to save the planet for future generations.
    
    Insight number #4: 
    If you're interested in learning more about Solarpunk, be sure to check out the resources we shared during the session. Together, we can work towards creating a better, more sustainable future for all.

    > FRIDAY 31TH [thread]
    > 
    1. 
    
    At Dream DAO, we're always thinking about how we can exponentially reach more people through #Ed3.
    
    As we reflect on our mission to empower Gen Z with the training, funding, and network they need we're constantly asking ourselves:
    
    how can we LEVEL UP? üí≠üÜô
    
    2. 
    
    Our journey started with @CivicsUnplugged, a social enterprise that runs a Fellowship program training high school-aged leaders to become civic innovators üåü
    
    Fellowship graduates then join an a community that provides lifelong opportunities to pursue their civic aspirations...
    
    3. 
    
    In just 2 years,  graduates have already created and contributed to projects that have positively impacted hundreds of thousands of people.
    
    While we've had success supporting young people... we recognise that they need proper training to #innovate üß†
    
    4. 
    
    As we all know, technology is the cornerstone of innovation and in an increasingly digital world, Ed3 is crucial to empower Gen Z to leverage its power for good.
    
    But how can we do that better? üéã
    
    How can we provide the most innovative learning experiences to our members? üí°
    
    1. 
    
    These are the big questions we are thinking through.
    
    And we need your help to do it ü´µ
    
    How can we level up education and reach more people in meaningful ways?
    
    Share your thoughts with us! üë©‚ÄçüöÄ

### IDEAS

- a series of tweets that explain web3 terminology of our space: refi, wallet etc etc
- a series of tweet that explain our terms: builders, champions, dreamers, LTs

- **LTs STRATEGY**
    
    [LTs problems and solutions](Social%20Media%20Coordinator%20182e131e26fc4cbea8fef00fe4746d90/LTs%20problems%20and%20solutions%20075bf893126c48a79452fa413fed77df.md)
    
    To solve this I would start to implement:
    -an ongoing stable strategy to share incoming LTs [imminent]
    -an ongoing stable strategy to share content from the LTs externally [imminent]
    -update our twitter list with the new champions and builders 
    > interact with them and build relationships [long term]
    
- **NFTs  STRATEGY**
    
    [https://www.notion.so/cucrew/Social-Media-Coordinator-182e131e26fc4cbea8fef00fe4746d90?pvs=4#34582af329e34dc7ab3df4d55d325b03](Social%20Media%20Coordinator%20182e131e26fc4cbea8fef00fe4746d90.md)
    To support the DAO in its NFTs sale I would:
    -restart the page one month before to make it hot and ready to support the marketing campaign
    -concentrate the communication in that month on the branding and visuals of the Skywalkers
    -have a far and different range of content regarding the Skywalkers (threads, quotes, opinions of champions builders and past stewards)
    -organise a coalition (and a direct communication channel) with the past stewards and the founders of DD (builders, stewards, sponsors, champions)
    -organise a coalition with CU
    -organise a coalition with our most active builders
    -organise a coalition with some others organizations in Ed3 
    
- **LIST OF VISUALS/CONTENT** @PlantBoi @Timofei Dort-Golts
    
    -to start, it would help a lot if we could craft 20 visual artefacts in both the Twitter posts format (1600 px X 900px) and the classic square format (the images already present can be used as presets/concept ideas).
    
    -in addition to this, it would help a lot if we could get additional content from the LTS. Depending on who is there, it would be cool if we could get some quotes, a screenshot of the people there smiling and a sum up of the session.
    

**STRATEGY UPDATE**
-restarted daily publishing, maintenance back to normal (1 original tweet everyday, 4 retweets more or less, support to our followers) ‚úÖ
-get more people to frequent Learning Togethers ‚ùì
-prepare the Skywalkers nft launch April (450, 1000) 

TO BE FIXED
-graphics graphics graphics graphics
-content post LTs (screenshot, quotes, videos)

FIXED
-Charlotte tells me when LTs are happening
-Tallyform/similar for incoming Skywalkers sale
-Updates more or less regular

NEW STRATEGY
concentrated on:
-enhance daily maintanance with visuals
-sold out NFTs (how much total?)
-more people at LTs (what if as twitter space/Discord? and we change their structure to offline events series plus online attendance as extra?)

NEW IDEAS
-a series of tweets that explain web3 terminology of our space: refi, wallet etc etc
-a series of tweet that explain our terms: builders, champions, dreamers, LTs
-visuals with Midjourney?
-LTs Celo as major event
-harry‚Äôs updates on Twitter?
