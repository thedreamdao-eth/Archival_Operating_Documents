# LTs problems and solutions

LT system.  Charlotte reaches out to potential hosts > looks for good dates/times > then schedules them in our Calendar > promotes them through email and Discord

Numbers:Our attendance has dropped significantly over the last few months.  -In the early days of the DAO, we'd get around 20 people per session.  -That became around 10 people in the fall

- Now, we are struggling to even get a handful of people. I think that 10 people is an ideal goal per session at this point.

Issues:- we aren't a giant community, and the people we do have are very busy and are in many different time zones.  -it's difficult to make things work for large groups at once.  -a decrease in general engagement with the DAO, especially engagement that doesn't come with a monetary reward or a bounty. Some of the connection/community aspects of the DAO have faded recently, I think.

Solution:

Essentially, I think we need to get the web3 public to attend LTs.  I don't have a ton of experience with social media, but that's how I think we can improve our sessions.
