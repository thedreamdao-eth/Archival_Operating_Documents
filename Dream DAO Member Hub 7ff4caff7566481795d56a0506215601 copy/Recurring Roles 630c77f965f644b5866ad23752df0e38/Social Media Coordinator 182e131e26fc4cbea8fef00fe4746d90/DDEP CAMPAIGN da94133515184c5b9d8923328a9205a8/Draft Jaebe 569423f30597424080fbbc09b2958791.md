1/ 🌟 Sharing the Journey of @@b_jaehee: Lessons from @DreamDAO_ Internship with @clim8collective and @CeloOrg 🚀

Join us as we delve into the transformative 10-week internship journey of Jae-Hee Bae. Gratitude to @ethanweii for inspiring this thread. Get ready for profound insights! 💡👇

2/ 💼 The Internship Experience: Clim8 Collective & Celo

Through the earnest support of Dream DAO, Jae-Hee had the privilege of interning at Clim8 Collective with Celo. These 10 weeks brought invaluable lessons and growth. A testament to the power of collaboration and impact. 🌿💫

3/ 🌻 Lesson 1: Web3's Empowering Paradigm

Web3 generously codifies personhood and earnestness into opportunity. Traditional application pipelines focus on retrospective evidence, while Web3 uplifts character criteria. Witnessing this revolution was truly inspiring. #Web3Revolution

4/ 🔍 Lesson 2: Navigating the Uncharted Territory

Web3 is young and uncharted, leading to an unusually high probability of duplicate efforts. Jae-Hee observed the abundance of similar initiatives in the web3 x climate tech space. Identifying areas of collaboration becomes paramount. #CollaborationOverCompetition

5/ 🌿 Lesson 3: Embracing Surrender and Mutualism

Surviving in nascent, homogenous markets calls for pride in surrender rather than conquest. Instead of 0-sum market capture, Jae-Hee learned the power of peer-to-peer learning and mutualism. Abundance lies in specialization, not dominion. #MutualGrowth

6/ 💡 Lesson 4: Redefining Competence and Teaching

Competence can sometimes lead to oversubscription. Jae-Hee highlights the importance of saying "yes" to teaching newcomers and investing in undiscovered talent. By expanding the supply of competence, we nurture a vibrant ecosystem of learning and growth.

7/ 🌿 Lesson 5: Spiritual Health and Resilience

In the web3 realm, alternative futures lie in the privilege of spiritual health. Jae-Hee emphasizes the significance of self-care, nurturing relationships, and elevating others with humility. Spiritual health forms the foundation of resilience. #ResilientWeb3

8/ ❤️ Gratitude and Appreciation
