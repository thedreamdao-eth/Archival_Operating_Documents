# My story üìö

Ever since I can remember I have characterized myself as a very curious person who likes to live new experiences and try new things, but without a doubt one of the biggest adventures I have had in the last year has been exploring a new tool that has changed my perspective of what we can as people achieve through it, and of course I mean the web3.

I think that if you ask the me from a few years ago if at some point in his life he would experience what I am currently experiencing, you would not believe it, since how would most people think that a 19-year-old can obtain an internship in a web3 organization? Well, it is my pleasure to tell you that, I did it and through this Learning Artifact I will comment with you the 3 lessons and learning that I acquired thanks to this new experience.

# How did all this start? üöÄ

First of all, I would like to share with you how I managed to get my first internship in a web3 organization; Since July 2022 I started to be part of DreamDAO, an organization that operates within the intersection of web3, this organization has the objective of empowering leaders of generation Z to generate an impact in the world through projects within the intersection of web3 providing support in financing, mentoring and unique opportunities that seek to contribute to the professional and personal development of its builders so that in the future they can build and lead projects of great impact in the world through web3.

Since joining DreamDAO as one of their builders, I have taken advantage of every opportunity they have given me, from having the opportunity to attend international conventions and workshops, taking courses and mentoring programs, and attending weekly learning sessions, but it was not until the beginning of December, when DreamDAO offered one of the greatest personal and professional development opportunities in the field of web3, since during that month they launched a program called "Explorers Program" which they had already had the opportunity to launch time ago, but for me it was the first time that I had the opportunity to apply. This program consisted of achieving that together with DreamDAO you could acquire an internship in a web3 organization according to your abilities, tastes and areas of learning.

I was honestly afraid to enter this program because, if I was connected and accepted into an organization, it was going to be the first time that I had been working professionally in any role not only in the intersection of web3, but it was the first time that I was going to perform professionally in my life; However, I accepted the challenge and, with the help of DreamDAO, I was able to connect with an organization called Lomads to work in the operations area.

# Lomads: The Organization ü¶æ

Lomads is a crypto-native ERP platform that streamlines transactions and permissions along with tool combinations including workflow automation and Soul Bound Tokens (SBT).

My role within Lomads is to carry out the indicated research within the web3 organizations (their line of business, their community structure, their government structure, their way of self-sustaining, their projects, etc.) and, in this way, be able to determine if the organizations being investigated are potential customers for Lomads. In addition to this, I was part of the operations team and helped performing other types of operational tasks.

# Learned lessons üéØ

Working at Lomads has undoubtedly been a great experience and an incredible opportunity for professional and personal development and learning. Specifically, the top three lessons I've learned from working in a web3 organization like Lomads are:

- Lesson 1 Trusting yourself: üòÉ
    
    The first thing I learned from working with Lomads is that there is always an opportunity to contribute in something that is important to the organization, but many times I did not dare to raise my hand since I did not know if what I was going to propose was important and thanks to Lomads I have learned to have more confidence to propose to help and contribute within the organization.
    
- Lesson 2 Organization: üóìÔ∏è
    
    The second most important thing I learned while working within Lomads is that within the web3 you interact with people from all over the world, and in your work the thing is no different, there were days in which I had sessions at times in those who already had plans to do other things, or there were times when work overlapped with meetings with other organizations, so I learned over time that when managing interactions with people from other time zones it is important to have a clear and efficient organization to be able to manage your work and your interactions efficiently and correctly.
    
- Lesson 3 Communication: üì±
    
    Finally, the last great lesson I learned working with Lomads is that communication is vital within a work environment, specifically within a web3 organization since when working remotely it is vital to have good communication with the time to work together. Personally, this last lesson was one of the most complicated in my case since trying to communicate with people from other time zones was somewhat complicated, but thanks to my colleagues at work, my boss and the planned organization I took, it was possible to have a good comunication.
