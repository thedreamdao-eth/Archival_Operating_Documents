"Dr. Miriam Meckel and/or Dr. Léa Steinacker ",0. Suggested,"Angelina Schülke ",angelina.schuelke@magenta.de,"The ada fellowship focuses on educating people (mostly employees) about future skills and the impact of technological developments on our society. Therefore, it would certainly be interesting for Dream DAO builders to learn more about what kinds of skills might become even more important in the future. 
In addition to that, ada is mostly led by women which is really inspiring for me. So far, the tech sector still seems very men-dominated, so I'd be curious to know more about what the women behind ada have to say about female empowerment in web3. ",Dr. Miriam Meckel (on LinkedIn) @mmeckel (on Twitter) | Dr. Léa Steinacker (on LinkedIn) @leasteinacker (on Twitter),"Since both of them are originally from Germany and the ada fellowship is based in Germany as well, I can help with reaching out etc. if needed. :) "
Eddie Choo,0. Suggested,"Angelina Schülke ",angelina.schuelke@magenta.de,"I got to know Eddie through one of Gitcoin's public goods talks and was immediately fascinated by the method of futures thinking that he presented. After getting in touch with him and having a really insightful conversation, I thought it could be great to dive a bit deeper into futures thinking because it's a great exercise in questioning existing systems and conventions as well as imagining something new. Eddie has lots of experience in going through this process with young people and I'm sure he could facilitate a cool, interactive workshop for us builders. ",EddieChoo#3604 on Discord,"Eddie already indicated his interest in hosting a Learning Together session or acting as an informal facilitator or advisor on futures thinking. 
I already reached out to Charlotte on Discord but also wanted to fill out this form just to make sure this suggestion doesn't get lost. "
"Cathy Mulligan ",0. Suggested,"Angelina Schülke ",angelina.schuelke@magenta.de,"Cathy Mulligan is a professor at the University of Lisbon conducting research on DAOs, cryptoeconomics, digital economics, decentralised systems, and the broader social impact of digital technologies. 
She's doing a lot of great stuff and could probably host several amazing LTs (check out the DCentral project, for example: https://dcentral-lab.org/). But I'd be particularly curious to what extend decentralization could make our societies more resilient or contribute to sustainability. . ","My mentor Louise Smith (who could be a great speaker on DeFi btw) knows her very well, so I think I could definitely contact her using my connections. Other options are LinkedIn (Cathy Mulligan Ph.D.) or Twitter (@API_Economics) ",
