Other notes: Since both of them are originally from Germany and the ada fellowship is based in Germany as well, I can help with reaching out etc. if needed. :) 
Suggester email: angelina.schuelke@magenta.de
Suggester name: Angelina Schülke 
Why suggested?: The ada fellowship focuses on educating people (mostly employees) about future skills and the impact of technological developments on our society. Therefore, it would certainly be interesting for Dream DAO builders to learn more about what kinds of skills might become even more important in the future. 
In addition to that, ada is mostly led by women which is really inspiring for me. So far, the tech sector still seems very men-dominated, so I'd be curious to know more about what the women behind ada have to say about female empowerment in web3.
