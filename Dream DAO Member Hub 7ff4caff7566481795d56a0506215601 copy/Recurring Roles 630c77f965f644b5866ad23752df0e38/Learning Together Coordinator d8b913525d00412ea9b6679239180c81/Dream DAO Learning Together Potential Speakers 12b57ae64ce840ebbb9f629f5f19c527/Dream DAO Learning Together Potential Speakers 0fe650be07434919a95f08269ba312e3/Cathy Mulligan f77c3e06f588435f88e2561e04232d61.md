# Cathy Mulligan

Invite Status: 0. Suggested
Contact info: My mentor Louise Smith (who could be a great speaker on DeFi btw) knows her very well, so I think I could definitely contact her using my connections. Other options are LinkedIn (Cathy Mulligan Ph.D.) or Twitter (@API_Economics) 
Suggester email: angelina.schuelke@magenta.de
Suggester name: Angelina Sch√ºlke 
Why suggested?: Cathy Mulligan is a professor at the University of Lisbon conducting research on DAOs, cryptoeconomics, digital economics, decentralised systems, and the broader social impact of digital technologies. 
She's doing a lot of great stuff and could probably host several amazing LTs (check out the DCentral project, for example: https://dcentral-lab.org/). But I'd be particularly curious to what extend decentralization could make our societies more resilient or contribute to sustainability. .
