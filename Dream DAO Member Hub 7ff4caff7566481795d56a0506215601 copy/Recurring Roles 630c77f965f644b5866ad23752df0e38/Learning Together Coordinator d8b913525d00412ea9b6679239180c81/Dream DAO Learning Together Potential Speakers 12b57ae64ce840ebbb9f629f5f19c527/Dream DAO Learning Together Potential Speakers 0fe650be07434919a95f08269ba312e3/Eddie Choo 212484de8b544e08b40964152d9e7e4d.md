Why suggested?: I got to know Eddie through one of Gitcoin's public goods talks and was immediately fascinated by the method of futures thinking that he presented. After getting in touch with him and having a really insightful conversation, I thought it could be great to dive a bit deeper into futures thinking because it's a great exercise in questioning existing systems and conventions as well as imagining something new. Eddie has lots of experience in going through this process with young people and I'm sure he could facilitate a cool, interactive workshop for us builders.
