# How to Create + Deliver POAPs

## Part 1: Update the Event Page

- Go here: [https://www.notion.so/cucrew/DAO-Events-Planning-Hub-Meeting-Notes-5eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8](../../Evergreen%20Documents%20976d2984e99f4146b4283457a2303a7c/Evergreen%20Documents%20Database%20db1ccc6322ae474dba4b59d6b687d080/Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8.md)
- Go to the relevant event page
- Update the attendees list (”Attendees” property) to reflect who came (this is probably tracked in the icebreaker)

- The attendees property on the page will look something like this once you’re done!

## Part 2: Create the POAP

- Create the POAP image
    - Go to this Canva edit link: [https://www.canva.com/design/DAEz444jVzU/share/preview?token=0IJfQib16ZyLuqSzXxnwlA&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAEz444jVzU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEz444jVzU/share/preview?token=0IJfQib16ZyLuqSzXxnwlA&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAEz444jVzU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton)
    - Update the graphic to have the relevant Learning Together number

    - Download the image with transparent background (png)
        
        ![Screen Shot 2022-01-22 at 8.28.12 PM.png](How%20to%20Create%20+%20Deliver%20POAPs%208caa926f2724413c802479c6a5316288/Screen_Shot_2022-01-22_at_8.28.12_PM.png)
        
- Go to [https://app.poap.xyz/admin/events/new](https://app.poap.xyz/admin/events/new)
    1. Name of event: [DREAM DAO] <insert name of the event e.g. “Learning Together #4”>
    2. Description: Insert an event description
    3. Click virtual event
    4. For Start Date, put the date the event happened
    5. Website is [https://dreamdao.xyz/](https://dreamdao.xyz/)
    6. Upload the POAP artwork - it should look good cropped in a circle
    7. Write down the “Edit Code” somewhere
    8. Put your email in the email section
    9. For Amount of Codes, put the number of attendees + 10 (just to be safe in case you missed some people)
        - so... if you estimate that 20 people came, request 30
- Notice that you got an email confirmation from POAP
- Click “view event details” in the email

- Copy the URL and paste it in the event page in Notion (it should look something like [https://app.poap.xyz/admin/events/dream-dao-hotpot-hangout-1-2022](https://app.poap.xyz/admin/events/dream-dao-hotpot-hangout-1-2022))

- Wait until POAP team emails you the unique POAP CODES (this may take 24 hrs)

## Part 3: Convert the txt file POAP sends you to CSV

- Check your email for the POAP unique links. It will look something like this:
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-01-22 at 8.21.52 PM.png](How%20to%20Create%20+%20Deliver%20POAPs%208caa926f2724413c802479c6a5316288/Screen_Shot_2022-01-22_at_8.21.52_PM.png)
    
- The email will have two attachments. Download the one that says links.txt
- Go here: [https://convertio.co/txt-csv/](https://convertio.co/txt-csv/)
- Upload links.txt to the site by clicking **Choose files**
- Click the big **Convert** button
- Click the blue **Download** button

## Part 4: Create a POAP Deliver Notion page.
