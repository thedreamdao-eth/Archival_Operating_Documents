Explanation: I am claiming the Teacher Merit Badge because I have co-hosted 1 Learning Together Session, specifically Learning Together Session #61 that was the discussion of the builders that went to Devcon and because I was one the builders who attended Devcon I had the opportunity to host with other builders this LT. The notes of that LT are in the following link: https://www.notion.so/cucrew/Dream-DAO-Learning-Together-61-Devcon-Discussion-d211b024f2db49ba985f44793ab241fe
