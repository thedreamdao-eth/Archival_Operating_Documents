# LT #76

Jeremy and Bruno hosted an engaging workshop about liberating structures with Dream DAO in LT #76 on May 18th. 

🧠Insight #1: The goldilocks zone of communication is the tendency to get the right amount of info to maximize the effectiveness of something. ⭐️

🧠Insight #2: pre-communication and providing additional info in an appealing way may encourage more people to attend meetings. ⚡️

🧠Insight #3: The essence of liberating structures is that having small group discussions is incremental to taking small steps towards change 🧗‍♀️

🧠Insight #4: We can tackle self-doubt in meetings by using the wise crowd method (ex: people ask questions and present their thoughts before the speakers begin). 📣

✨Interesting quote: “Try to get into the practice of asking What? So what? Now what? to debrief from successes and failures.”
