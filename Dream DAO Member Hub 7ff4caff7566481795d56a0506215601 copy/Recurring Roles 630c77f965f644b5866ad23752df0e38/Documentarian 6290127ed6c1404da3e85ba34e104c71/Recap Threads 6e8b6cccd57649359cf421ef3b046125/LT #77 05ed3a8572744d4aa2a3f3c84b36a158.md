🧠Insight #1: Choose the right platform for your mission/brand in order to use relevant features and target the right audience. 🎯

🧠Insight #2: Specify or hone in on your niche instead of being too general as it could make it harder for people to discover your page. ⚡️

🧠Insight #3: Don’t discount the value of connecting with early followers ⭐️

🧠Insight #4: Get inspired by similar content as opposed to imitating it as authenticity through the creation of meaningful content is valued. 💚
