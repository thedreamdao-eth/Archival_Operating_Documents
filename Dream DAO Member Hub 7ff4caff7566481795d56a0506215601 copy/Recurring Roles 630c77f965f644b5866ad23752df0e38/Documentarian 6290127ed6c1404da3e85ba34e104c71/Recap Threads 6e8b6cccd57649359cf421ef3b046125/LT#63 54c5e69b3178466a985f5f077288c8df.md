Zac McClure works at TokenTax, an organization that helps you manage crypto taxes. On December 8th, McClure spoke with Dream DAO about crypto taxes. 

ðŸ§ Insight #1:  Always sell things for a long-term capital gain as opposed to a short-term capital gain. Ideally, a holding period of one year for crypto assets is recommended but it depends on the value of the asset(s).Â ðŸ“ˆ

ðŸ§ Insight #2: TokenTax helps DAOs and individuals do crypto taxes through offering software and accounting services. If you're interested in using this service, it's recommended that you read their Essential Guide to Crypto Taxes ([https://tokentax.co/crypto-taxes](https://tokentax.co/crypto-taxes))Â ðŸ’°

ðŸ§ Insight #3: Taxes are done quarterly. For example, let's say that you are self-employed and made $40,000 from Blockchain marketing. You would have to pay taxes in 4 quarterly increments ($10K each quarter).Â ðŸ’¸

ðŸ§ Insight #4: In short, crypto taxes are done the same way as regular taxes and it's just another name for the specific type of income that you made in crypto.Â ðŸ’š
