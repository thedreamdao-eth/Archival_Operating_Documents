🧠Insight #1: When you put money in a bank account, the bank gains custody over your money and lends it to others. The same concept applies to web3 wallets. 💸

🧠Insight #2: Non-custodial wallets give users the autonomy and freedom to use their assets/funds as they wish to and you can easily connect it to other apps and services. 👍

🧠Insight #3: Some examples of non-custodial wallets in web3 include: MetaMask, Parity, Brave Browser, and MyEtherWallet. 💚

✨Interesting quote: “Metamask is a compatible wallet in many ways but it’s important to understand that you don’t have to be limited to only 1 wallet. “
