# LT #78

Lena Hierzi is the Governor of H.E.R. DAO and spoke with Dream DAO about Web3 Hackathons in LT #78.

🧠Insight #1: Participating in hackathons allows you to meet investors for your project and mentors that can help guide you in the future. 💚

🧠Insight #2: Try to have the basic web3 libraries and tools installed before the hackathon in order to save time. ⏰

🧠Insight #3: Create a notion page, a group chat, and a timeline for your team to use during the hackathon. 💻

🧠Insight #4: An ideal pitchdeck should be 5-10 slides with no more than 3 points on each slide. ⭐️

✨Interesting quote: “You will know if someone is a good potential co-founder/team member after working with them in a hackathon.”
