# **Zane Huffman is the founder of Governor DAO and spoke with Dream DAO about the new political economy on March 22nd.**

🧠Insight #1: Capitalism isn't a perfect economic system and neither is socialism. Because there isn't an effective balance between efficiency and equity. ⚖️

🧠Insight #2: DAOs can be a solution to our current economic models because they prioritize open participation, incentive aligned contributors, and are governed by members. 🪄

🧠Insight #3: DAOs differ from corporations because there is enforcement by code, self-governance as opposed to a board of directors, and automated administration. 💚

🧠Insight #4: The 3 main types of DAOs that exist today are investment DAOs, service DAOs, and community DAOs. ✨

✨Interesting quote: “The efficient nature of DAOs enables the practice of trying different ideas, bootstraping those ideas, and allowing the best ideas to thrive.”
