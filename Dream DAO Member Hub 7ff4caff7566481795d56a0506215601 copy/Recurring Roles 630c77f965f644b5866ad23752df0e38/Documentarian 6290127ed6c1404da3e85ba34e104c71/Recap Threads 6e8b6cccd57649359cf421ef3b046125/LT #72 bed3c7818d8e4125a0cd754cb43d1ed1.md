# LT #72

On March 30th, Dream DAO had a group discussion about how we can improve DAOs.

🧠Insight #1: Web3 is hard to navigate as a beginner due to the limited amount of resources available to learn about it. Having conversations about it with others can help spark interest. 🗣️
🧠Insight #2: Decentralization and DAOs haven't gained mainstream acclaim. Many DAOs are inefficient and have trouble finding people to do specific tasks. 🔴
🧠Insight #3: Web3 tends to have a branding issue as some countries have banned crypto and it generates skepticism. The structural aspects will likely improve over time. 📈

✨Interesting quote: “It’s really important for us to advocate for web3 because there’s not enough coverage about ReFi or public goods with Blockchain in the media.”
