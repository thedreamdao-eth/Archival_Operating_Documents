🧠Insight #1: Let's define "externality." A positive externality is the benefit of producing something and a negative externality is the result of what you produce. 📊
🧠Insight #2: ReFi is an economy that maximizes value for groups with conservation and inclusive growth. Whereas DeFi is the typical capitalistic economy. 💚
🧠Insight #3: In order to reach zero emissions, we have to talk to people and groups beyond the crypto space to implement and generate ideas. 🌱

✨Interesting quote: “We should aim to consume and regenerate continuously over time.”
