Almond Holz is a Community and Communications team member at Giveth and spoke with Dream DAO about Giveth x Web3 impact space on May 8th. 

🧠Insight #1: Giveth is a web3 donation platform where donors can fund impactful projects and projects are supported. 🤩

🧠Insight #2: Nonprofits typically have access to limited funding, aren’t able to reach their target audience, and have limited access to networks and partnerships. Web3 can solve this. 

🧠Insight #3: Giveth utilizes Blockchain technology to reward funding in a way that’s low-barrier to entry and has zero added fees. 🌱

🧠Insight #4: The GIV Token is used for governance, reward systems, community culture, and the common pool. 🪙

✨Interesting quote: “The end goal is for projects to become DAOs that create economies that are powered by the GIV Token.”
