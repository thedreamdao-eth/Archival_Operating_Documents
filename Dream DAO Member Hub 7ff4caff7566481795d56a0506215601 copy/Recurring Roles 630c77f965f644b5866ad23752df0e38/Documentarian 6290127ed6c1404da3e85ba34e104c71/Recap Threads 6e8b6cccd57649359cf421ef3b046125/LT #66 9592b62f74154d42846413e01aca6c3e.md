Madison Adams is a former Community/Coordination Wizard at Dream DAO. On February 1st, Madison spoke with Dream DAO about networking in web3. 

🧠Insight #1: Networking doesn’t have to feel awkward or inauthentic. The best way to avoid this is to network with people that you’re genuinely interested in and focus on adding value. 🤝

🧠Insight #2: Networking with people that you like allows you to build a long-term relationship with the person, gives you opportunities to add more value, and it’s more exciting. 

🧠Insight #3: Some web3 networking ideas include engaging with content on Twitter, attending virtual and irl events, joining DAOs and discord servers, and cold outreach. 

🧠Insight #4: Some non-transactional ways to network are to ask people about their hobbies/interests and personal life, share contebt you think they would enjoy, and do fun activities together.
