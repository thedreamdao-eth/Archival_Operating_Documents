🧠Insight #1: Imposter syndrome is when you doubt your skills and achievements and worry about being exposed as a “fraud.” 🤯

🧠Insight #2: Successful people also struggle with Imposter Syndrome! It sometimes might not go away regardless of how much success you achieve. The solution is found internally by acknowledging your talents/abilities. 🏆

🧠Insight #3: Learn to recognize the villain voice (negative) and radical hero voice (positive) in your head and actively choose to pay more attention to the radical hero voice. 🗣️

🧠Insight #4: Maintaining a state of mind with curiosity allows you to be a student for life abd gives you the confidence to fail and ask a lot of questions. 🔭
