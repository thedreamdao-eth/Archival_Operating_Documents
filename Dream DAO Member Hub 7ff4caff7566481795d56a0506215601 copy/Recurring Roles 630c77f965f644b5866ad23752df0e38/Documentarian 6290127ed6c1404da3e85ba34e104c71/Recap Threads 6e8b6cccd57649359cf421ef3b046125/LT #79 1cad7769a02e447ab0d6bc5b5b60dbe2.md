# LT #79

Kris Millar spoke with Dream DAO about using DAOs to scale regenerative systems in LT #79. 

🧠Insight #1: DAOs will most likely enhance traditional companies as opposed to replacing them. 📣

🧠Insight #2: Traditional companies have a hierarchy and a clear path for promotions but may lack transparency and autonomy. 📈

🧠Insight #3: DAOs have a more adaptable structure and transparency in funding but may lack coordination and a legal status. ⚪️

🧠Insight #4: Community building and proper delegation are great ways to optimize a DAO’s output given a lack of hierarchy. 💚

✨Interesting quote: “Decentralised governance reduces reliance on individual actors
and mitigates the risks of central points of failure.”
