The typical post-event recap thread consists of these tweets:

- INTRO
- RECAP BY...
- THE GUEST + WHY WE INVITED THEM
- INSIGHTS pt 1
- INSIGHTS pt 2
- INSIGHTS pt 3
- *could have more insights beyond 3*
- CALL TO ACTION

Here are two examples of a Drafting Page that you can duplicate:

For the INTRO section, itâ€™s helpful to add a screenshot of the event that serves as a good representation of the vibe/presentation/discussion. For example:

![Screen Shot 2022-02-12 at 12.40.55 PM.png](How%20to%20Create%20A%20Post-Event%20Recap%20Thread%20954927a3fa284f2e980d95363eee15f6/Screen_Shot_2022-02-12_at_12.40.55_PM.png)

Throughout the Tweet Thread body. Please feel free to include more images.

You should also add a graphic to the end of the tweet thread. One of these tends to work well:
