# How To Coordinate Agreements

> The main responsibility of anyone performing this role is setting up the process for voting.
> 

### Before doing all the steps you will need the below things to start

**Full access to these Notion pages:**

[](../../Design%20Documents%20&%20Braindumps%2096c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae.md) 

[Governance Proposals](../../Governance%20Proposals%205d412cf3fc7743baaa779bd95bf06dc5.md) 
[](../../Community-Approved%20Agreements%208a69d0fe98644312a618f9f7dbd985a2.md)[Community-Approved Agreements](../../Community-Approved%20Agreements%208a69d0fe98644312a618f9f7dbd985a2.md) 

### **What are you supposed to do?**

1. Every Monday: Sending sanity-checked ideas/ braindumps to DreamerZ.
2. Every Friday: Turning Briandump(s) into proposal(s) and sending it.
3. Setting up I Voted POAP.
4. Organizing Notion.
5. Doing all the work that involves Snapshot(and voting.
6. Working on communication that comes under a one-off task.

- Timing is very important for this role so sending proposals at a similar time is suggested. It is not necessary but mail should be sent between 9 AM EST and 3 PM EST(This is the time when most of the DreamerZ are active).

**How would you know which ideas are ready to be sent on Monday?**
Most of the time Co-Steward will inform you or the creator of the brain dump will send it to you. The ideas/braindumps should be checked by at least 2-3 other members and it should be in this format to provide voting members with a clear idea to give feedback(Sometimes you will need to do this).

Every Monday you will need to create a Discord thread for discussion for each idea in the #ideas-and-proposals channel. Don‚Äôt forget to provide the link to the thread on the notion page for ideas.

### After everything is checked you have to send these ideas to voting members on Monday. You can use the below format for email:

Subject: **[DREAM DAO] Call for Comments**

Hey DreamerZ,

For this week's ‚ÄúCall for Comments‚Äù, we have the following to be reviewed before turning into the proposal:

- [Name of the Idea(Hyperlinked)] with link to Discussion Thread
- [Name of the Idea(Hyperlinked)] with link to Discussion Thread
- [Name of the Idea(Hyperlinked)] with link to Discussion Thread

You have until Thursday at [Time, mostly 6 PM EST] to give feedback.

If you have any issues, reply to this email or ping me on Discord [Your Discord ID].

Yours¬†sincerely,

[Your Name]

*Now post this in the #DreamerZ-Announcemet channel on Discord.*

After the feedback period is over, the creator of the brain dump has the option to decide whether to go with the idea or not. If they decide to go ahead for the voting, you will need to create a proposal according to the brain dump.

### Here‚Äôs the guide for that:

### How to change an Idea into a Proposal?

1. Go to this [Governance Proposals](../../Governance%20Proposals%205d412cf3fc7743baaa779bd95bf06dc5.md) 
2. Create a new block using this template [PROPOSAL TEMPLATE](../../Governance%20Proposals%205d412cf3fc7743baaa779bd95bf06dc5/PROPOSAL%20TEMPLATE%20d9e8266691274cd08bb257700320ee69.md) 
3. Now update that according to the brain dump/idea. Feel free to check previous proposals to get an idea about how to write goals and other things about the proposal.
4. Always put the link to the brain dump/ idea in the description.

**After creating the proposal with the detailing it needs.** 

### Here‚Äôs the next step to be done on [Dream DAO‚Äôs Snapshot Hub](https://snapshot.org/#/thedreamdao.eth):

[How to Setup Snapshot](How%20To%20Coordinate%20Agreements%2042dec2b23cce4d5685d0e10a7885902b/How%20to%20Setup%20Snapshot%20fc7ecc3f5aba4d059f5e5c2b8ea1efbf.md)

After publishing proposals on snapshot update this  [Governance Proposals](../../Governance%20Proposals%205d412cf3fc7743baaa779bd95bf06dc5.md) accordingly.

### **Now, draft a mail using the below template:**

Subject:  **[DREAM DAO] Call for Vote**

*After sending mail to voting members post this in the #DreamerZ-Announcemet channel on Discord.*

Now after doing all the above things, you will need to link Snapshot Proposals with an I Voted POAP.

### Here‚Äôs the guide for that:

[How to Link I Voted POAP](How%20To%20Coordinate%20Agreements%2042dec2b23cce4d5685d0e10a7885902b/How%20to%20Link%20I%20Voted%20POAP%20569720dbeb1b45f3a4972264b199db0c.md)

After voting ends update these notion pages accordingly:

1. [Community-Approved Agreements](../../Community-Approved%20Agreements%208a69d0fe98644312a618f9f7dbd985a2.md) 
2. [Governance Proposals](../../Governance%20Proposals%205d412cf3fc7743baaa779bd95bf06dc5.md)
