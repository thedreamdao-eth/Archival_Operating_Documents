# January

Digest: We had eight braindumps/ideas this month, seven of which went for snapshot voting. The DAO successfully agreed upon six proposals, including the proposal for a Social Media Coordinator (we voted on this twice, as we could not reach the quorum the first time).
The authors of one proposal (Integration Program for S3 builders) decided not to proceed with snapshot voting after receiving feedback from the community.
This month, we also successfully implemented shutter voting on Snapshot. 
Additionally, we received 20 votes each for the last three proposals after failing to reach the quorum. Some of the proposals are already linked with the I Voted POAP; some are in progress.
No. of Proposal Successfully created : 7
