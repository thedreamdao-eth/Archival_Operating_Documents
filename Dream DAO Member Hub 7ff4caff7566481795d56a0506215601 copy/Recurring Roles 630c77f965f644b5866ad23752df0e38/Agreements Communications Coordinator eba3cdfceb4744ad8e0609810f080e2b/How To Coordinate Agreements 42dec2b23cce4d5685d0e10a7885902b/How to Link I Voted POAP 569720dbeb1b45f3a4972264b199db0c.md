**On the page that follows, fill in the details accordingly:**
*Everything on this page (except the POAP image) can be updated later using the edit code.*

1. Name of event: [DREAM DAO] <insert name of the Proposal e.g. “Proposal #41”>
2. Description: <Insert an event description eg. “This POAP was distributed to Dream Dao's voting members who voted on Proposal #42.” >
3. Click Virtual Drop
4. For the Start Date, put the same start date as the proposal
5. Website is [https://dreamdao.xyz/](https://dreamdao.xyz/)
6. Upload the POAP artwork - it should look good cropped in a circle
7. Write down the “Edit Code” somewhere
8. Put your email in the email section
9. For Amount of Codes, put 0.
- Notice that you got an email confirmation from POAP

## **Step 3: Link your proposal to the POAP drop**

Go to this google form [https://forms.gle/t7Cwd7TjqmNanhwb6](https://forms.gle/t7Cwd7TjqmNanhwb6)

### What are people voting on? *

*In as few words as possible, tell us what someone is voting for in your proposal*

DREAM DAO's PROPOSAL #40: Sending Builders to Web3Conf

### Additional context

*Optional. Is there anything else we should know that would help expedite our review process?*

We have asked for POAP for snapshot voting earlier as well(Event #38792), but our proposal hasn't yet been linked with the POAP. We will be requesting POAP for all our upcoming proposals, I want to know if there is any way that will ensure seamless linking of POAP to our proposal.

### Discourse Topic

*Optional. If you have a case open on [https://discourse.poap.xyz](https://discourse.poap.xyz/) please link to the topic here*

[https://discourse.poap.xyz/t/event-38792-drop-date-13th-april-poap-is-not-yet-linked-to-our-snapshot-proposal/4714](https://discourse.poap.xyz/t/event-38792-drop-date-13th-april-poap-is-not-yet-linked-to-our-snapshot-proposal/4714)

### Things to remember:

Curators will link POAPs once the voting has finished.

Every POAP needs unique artwork. Adding the proposal title, date and/or a sequential number to the artwork would be sufficient.

You don't need to request any mint links for snapshot proposals.

Create a case [here](https://discourse.poap.xyz/), if the snapshot is not linked with POAP after 24-48 hours.
