    Thank you so much for your time today! It was awesome and exciting to learn more about you, your career, all the work you have done so far, your interests/passions, plans, projects and your experience in web3.
    
    I just gave you the role "Friend of DAO" in our server, this gives you access to more channels here and to be able to attend some Learning Together Sessions if you wish. Feel free to use the #👋｜introductions channel to introduce yourself and browse the other channels like #📚｜learning-togethers,  #🌮｜community-love, #🤩｜opportunities and the others.
