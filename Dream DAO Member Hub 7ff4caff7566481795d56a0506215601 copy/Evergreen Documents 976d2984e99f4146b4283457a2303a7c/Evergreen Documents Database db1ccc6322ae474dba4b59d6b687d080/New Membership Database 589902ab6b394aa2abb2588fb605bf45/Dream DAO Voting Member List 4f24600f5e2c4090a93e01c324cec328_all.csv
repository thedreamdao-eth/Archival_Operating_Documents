https://twitter.com/Aabhas_Senapati,"I am 17 y.o. a young social-entrepreneur from Ahmedabad, India with the vision to change the mindset of people, I strive to reform education.
I run a start-up ThingFinder(tag-device to help Alzheimer patients & elderly keep track of their day-to-day objects), which is incubated at GUSEC, and have raised about $4000 in grants for it.
https://to.aabhass.in/ThingFinder
Having participated in 20+ international hackathons and won 7 (3 MIT-Challenges), I have got to expand my network and furnish my skills. And through global communities, I have been able to expand my horizon of perspectives.
I have worked through Social Entrepreneurship and Hardware-Development, to devise solutions towards solving issues of Alzheimer’s, Mental-Health, Data-Bias in Clinical-Research, Emergency Safety, Accessibility of Health-Care & Education.
I have been working as an advisory board member of UNICEF’s Young People’s Action Team, to raise voices of youth in policy advocacy and applying efforts like YoungWarrior Movement at the grass-root level. And it has been great being a bridge between youth and UNICEF.
https://to.aabhass.in/UNICEF
I am also part of Human Impacts Institute's Youth Advisory Council, working towards climate artivism and youth advocacy for the same.
I also sometimes blog with friends, exchanging views on socio-psychological issues to bring a positive impact, and also have community discussion to burst my own bubbles and learn new perspective of the world to navigate better. Here on https://beyondbubble.org/
I feel that “Everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler”. In life, satisfaction is the key, and you can get satisfaction by giving rather than taking, this is what keeps me motivated to improve the world.
I believe creating an impact depends on changing mindsets, best achieved through “true education”. I want to work towards implementing this change I envision. I believe that although the world has many intelligent people, it needs wise people mostly because the attitude and effective implementation matters even more than innovation. Implementation is more important and relevant than knowing. I think that we need to realize that death is the ultimate truth of life and need to embrace the uncertainty, which will help us be much more benevolent and treat everyone better to make it a better place. And one of the best tools to achieve the same is through Openness and Benevolence, and I beleive that being decentralised (i.e. amall local quanta interconnected to each other), whoch would greta significantly to step out of echo chambers through tools like AI, and benevolence being gimbibed through our educations systems would ensure that we as humanity contribute our bit to the larger shceme of universe.
I am also one of the 100 RISE Global Winners, who will be supported for a lifetime from education to social initiatives by Schmidt Futures and Rhodes Trust to create impact in their communities.

Recently I have been doing a research internship at IIT Gandhingagar, where I have been working on electronics and hardware end to develop accesible lung health diagnostic devices through masks using sensors to monitor breath data using microphones and carbon dioxide sensors.
https://to.aabhass.in/publication
My fascination has particualrly been around intersection of Entrpreneurship, Hardware Technology and Philosophy, more specifically learning science and innovation through the lens of philosophy to ensure that intent meets it's impact, and ""effective altruism"" through benevolence and openness can be practiced. I particularly feels inspired through the ocncept of Oneness, and how we are part of the greater conciousness and destiny and how this transience in life, can help us to develop fearless optimisim and give our best.
Here's my TEDx Talk below where is hare about my steps of developing a vision beyond bubbles for life and how I want to go about creating that impact I envision.
TEDx Talk – https://to.aabhass.in/ted
“Doing what most of us failed to, Master Aabhas Senapati has turned these pandemic ridden 18 months into a process of figuring out how to burst bubbles, see beyond and contribute to humanity as an asset; telling us to peer past the selfishness and how lending aid to even one may spike into a butterfly effect of positivity. Looking over the repetition of setting one goal after the other, he sheds light on the value of finding a true purpose in life by aligning milestones that lead up to it. Through changing mindsets, preaching the necessity of wiseness over intelligence is how his vision comes close to completion.”

Apart from attending school I spend my time coding, playing a lot of video games, writing, and reading anything I can get my hands on. I've also gotten into entrepreneurship and am currently building my own passion project called Buildr (not up yet). I'm a published author, an innovator at The Knowledge Society, Young Researcher at New York Academy of Sciences and just officially became an alum of Civics Unplugged where I wrote my case brief on blockchain!! Currently my main areas of interest have been AI and I've built some cool projects such as a CV-based posture correction system and am currently building an AI to detect microplastics in food. Apart from just using tech to improve people's lives (mine too haha), I love to build cool stuff (although I try to make it a little useful at least) and when working on a very long-term project to use user data to create hyper-personalised gaming worlds, I came across how web3 would integrate into that (and knew I had to get into this space!)

My lasting relationship with Sports has made my life fitness-centric, and I have attempted to further enhance my knowledge by pursuing a diploma in sports nutrition. I am an active trader beyond the classroom and have experience of 3 years in dealing in the cash and derivatives markets, analysing charts, and interpreting trends. I have significant experience in retail, working with my father in our family business, wherein I manage the purchasing and inventory department. Having read numerous books and talks on spirituality and Indian mythology, I have evolved as an ardent cogitator and a dialectician.

Inquisitiveness about the same often leads to discussions with my family, which is my favourite pastime. I have led multiple social welfare projects in my city.

My dad used to explain to me about cars, the models and the features of the cars everytime we went to their showroom. This developed my further interest in cars. Entrepreneurship came to me naturally, I always wanted to lead teams and guide people. Perhaps, my dad’s work inspired me. But looking at others lead passionate teams made me more passionate about this particular interest of mine. I have also been an introvert, it has been hard starting conversations but once I get to know my peers, I interact normally with them. Interacting with people hasn’t been tough because I don’t care about if people judge me,because people online have been very supportive. Additionally, I am an enthusiastic, funny and empathetic person. My mom has always taught me to be kind and I started developing empathy towards others, I have helped out at local NGOs too!

,"I am Ale, originally from Peru, currently studying entrepreneurship. I am passionate about all things social impact, I've started Sigueme Voluntariado, an NGO in the poorest slums of Peru, we built 25 houses and 16 staircases. I then started Enseñame and scaled an online platform to bring one-on-one education to children in Peru whose schools closed as they had no resources to provide online classes. It scaled to 3000 kids tutored by 3000 tutors within 5 months and many professional psychologists, teachers ad big companies CSR initiatives such as IBM joined the mission to support our volunteers. My role in both NGOs was in the strategic, coordinating, and executing side to lead the teams.  This summer I interned at Fifty Years, a VC supporting entrepreneurs solving worlds problems (literally if the impact was not the end goal, it was a pass) and currently exploring my next entrepreneurial endeavour. My passion for impact started through helping these communities but I am very excited about health in particular. I am fascinated about optimizing our biology so we no longer have disease through the right nutrition, meditation, syncing our circadian rhythm, fasting, cold exposure, and choosing the actions that are individually right for each person's unique biology. We have stirred away from nature so much and lost touch with our internal biology hence creating disease. I see web3 brings immense opportunity to bring finance to the unbanked, job opportunities with those with less access to education, to use finance as a means to regenerate our environment and to create communities that can pursue passions and create value for the planet while also being rewarded for it. I see web3 as the opportunity to shift away from traditional ineffective nonprofit activity into a radical systemic change through community and redefining processes but still need a community of other builders and mentors in the space to achieve this mission.

https://twitter.com/Angelina__Sch,"One month ago, I left the small village in the south of Germany where I had grown up and moved to Berlin for an internship at a foundation in the education sector. My initial intention was to gain some work experience in the foundation and non-profit area as well as help organize workshops that would help students from non-academic backgrounds to find their dream major and navigate the college application process. What I didn’t imagine, though, is how valuable and transformative this whole experience would actually be. Taking a gap year has given me the opportunity to finally immerse myself in everything I’m interested in – ranging from art over philosophy to linguistics, community building and democracy – and to start looking at a bigger picture through drawing new connections between those topics. What drives me is the fascination for interdisciplinary questions. And this is also why the Dream DAO has caught my attention. 

Combining web3 and social impact means connecting the dots in a different way. It means raising questions and ideas that extend and challenge my thinking and that is exactly what I was looking for in my gap year. While I haven’t really had the chance to learn something about web3 before, I am convinced that web3 paired with social impact purposes has an enormous potential for the future. Civics Unplugged has inspired me to give back to society and I would like to spread this spirit among other young people as well. That’s why I am determined to be on the forefront of this innovative path and help design it, instead of just sitting in the sidelines watching someone else attempting to do so.

I live at home with my parents, who support me in exploring my identity and passions. By studying at an Online School since 2022, I have had a lot of time to devote to my activities in social justice, for example, volunteering with UNICEF to work on enhancing teenage mental health in the Netherlands. I find their mission very beautiful, as mental health encompasses everyone’s life: work, hanging out with friends, and academic life. The latter, education, is my biggest passion yet. In 2021, I did a research project on why the Dutch secondary school system was (and is) failing. Different issues were explored, including inequality in academic freedom and passion for learning and creativity being discarded.

During these last years, in addition to school and music, I have been part of different organizations and social projects both in Mexico and abroad (Civics Unplugged, Ivy House, Rise for the World, Bécalos), as well as different programs and courses of leadership and social entrepreneurship that I have had the good fortune to take, such as the Civics Unplugged Fellowship given by Civics Unplugged and the Human Leadership Program given by Ivy House.
Honestly, in recent years I have reflected a lot about what matters to me and what interests me in my life and I have come to the conclusion that I love and am passionate about many things, including music and finances, but above all, I am interested in learning and being able to develop my skills to help others, I feel that this is what has defined me as a person, being someone who is always curious to learn new things.",Fernando Cruz,fernandobcruzperez@gmail.com,Fernando Cruz#6260,0x32E4B18614006F4b6BEEc5bfF7b33c8162353794,Active Voting Member,S2 Builder 🧑‍🚀,"Gatherings 🫂, Governance ⚙️, Grants 💰",Mexico City,"October 15, 2003",,www.linkedin.com/in/fernandobcruzperez,he/him,"Dream DAO Learning Together #68: “Solarpunk” (Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20#68%20%E2%80%9CSolarpunk%E2%80%9D%205638a804cc2041918cab3b50dc078dd3.md), Dream DAO Learning Together #69: “ReFi with Beltran Berrocal” (Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20#69%20%E2%80%9CReFi%20with%20Beltran%209a80c32b28814b6d8efb0092d4bed103.md), Dream DAO Learning Together #70: “DAO: The New Political Economy” (Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20#70%20%E2%80%9CDAO%20The%20New%20Polit%20ef4a7b348195466aa6e28428463fd291.md), Dream DAO Learning Together #71: “Soulbound Tokens” (Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20#71%20%E2%80%9CSoulbound%20Tokens%E2%80%9D%20d29f27f318904bb0a66843261401db0a.md), Dream DAO Learning Together #72: “Improving DAOs” (Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20#72%20%E2%80%9CImproving%20DAOs%E2%80%9D%206ff1e83d4c9d45319758dfbffa516695.md), Dream DAO Learning Together #79: “A Novel Ideas Engine: Using DAOs to Scale Regenerative Systems” (Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20#79%20%E2%80%9CA%20Novel%20Ideas%20Eng%20123121ba1aaa415caf2a2f47dea2955c.md)"

,"I am an always-in-movement, ambitious, systematic, and critical teen. From books to volunteering to programs, I aim to find an ethical and personal growth path that combines social impact, advocacy, and deep research (in technology and politics/economy). But mainly, nowadays, I care about public policy in Brazilian cities. 
For +2 years journey, I have dug into social impact and team leadership. I engaged in 21st education (community engagement leader), conscious young entrepreneurship (director of a +500 ex-participants community of entrepreneurship), and women’s health (tampons raising) in my city. This program showed governance issues that shocked me to wanna change that I see as a technology and innovation consequence. a technology and social innovation learning journey started for me. Nowadays, I am a quantum computing course student and a New York Academy of Sciences Young Member, studying critical thinking.
More than my passions and purpose, between studies and programs, I find myself discussing the world with my dad, puzzling, reading classical books, and watching series.

,"I'm Gabrielle from Brazil, I’m 18 and my pronouns are she/her. Currently, one of my biggest passions is programming. Not just the act of programming, but the act of creating games from scratch and sending a positive message to people. I believe that everything around us is art, and games bring a very interactive way of touching us throughout both our best and worst moments. During the last two years, I've been learning to interact with different programming languages, participating in some hackathons, and even winning some. Additionally, I am involved in LGBTQIA+ advocacy and, in the future, I hope to increase queer representation within games and animations, as the current industry still harbors traits of discrimination and inequality. My goal in the game industry is to build a fantasy where anyone could see themselves in it and communicate a nice message while doing so. Last but not least, I am also involved in climate activism and had participated in two organizations that do a great job of spreading reliable information on their media.",Gabrielle Oliveira,oliveiragabrielle662@gmail.com,gabss#9375,0x52f7Baa31C9A0460Fb73eB1eC692F16805E31B4D,Active Voting Member,S3 Builder 🧑‍🚀,"Gatherings 🫂, Governance ⚙️",Rio de Janeiro,"December 28, 2004",,www.linkedin.com/in/gabriellefoliv,she/her,

https://twitter.com/kabir_burman,"Ask anyone about me at school or any of my colleagues at work and they’ll tell you that I love to talk. Whether it was when working with one of India’s first digital museums or when I interned as a high school student at a national newspaper and during the course of my tenure as Editor-in-Chief of my school magazine, I have steadily developed this ability to communicate with everyone and anyone at any given time. 

From representing and understanding a myriad of different national interests, each unlike the previous for my school’s Model United Nations team, to working with delegates and government representatives at the United Nations Development Programme, I have come to understand how much our world depends not only on the ability to speak loudly and clearly of one’s own view, but also listening and understanding opposing perspectives.  

In coordinating student run organizations which advocate for better access to mental health resources and ridding the stigma around the traditionally taboo topic, to writing for international journalists and highlighting the unseen, I have developed a passion for not only bringing light to these issues around the world–but also becoming the voice of those that cannot speak for themselves.",Kabir Burman,kabir.burman27@gmail.com,Kabirrr#4384,0xDF58525d6BF63b71b6B8B6c95F3193F2eC5BFeed,Active Voting Member,S3 Builder 🧑‍🚀,Governance ⚙️,Bangalore,"November 27, 2003",,linkedin.com/in/kabir-burman,He/Him/His,

,"I'm Luis, a teacher by heart, a learner of life, and an aspiring social entrepreneur.  When people hear my name I want to be remembered as a connector of dreams, as someone who brings joy, with a joke,  amidst the sadness, and the person who can open students' eyes to opportunities.  As a First Generation student, I work closely with low-income teens to give them the resources to succeed. In order to do so, I’m learning constantly from their perspectives by volunteering in international organizations and working on social projects. Indeed, since 2020 I have been leading a youth organization that has helped underprivileged students to learn English and boost their socioemotional skills. Because of my civic engagement, I have got some recognition:

Selected as one of the 34 Global Teen Leaders by We Are Family Foundation, in a pool of more than 500 applications, for my social innovation Edulimitless and contribution to shaping a better world. (2022)
Selected as a Young challenger by The Grameen Creative Lab (GCL), founded by Muhammad  Yunus-Nobel Peace Prize.  Got one of the 40 full scholarships to pitch a business idea in Italy out of 200 applicants. (2022)

,"I'm a Nigerian interested in climate change advocacy and environmental sustainability. As an aspiring environmental engineer, I am passionate about designing sustainable technologies that are accessible in economically vulnerable communities, especially those in third-world countries. I am passionate about youth mobilization and empowerment. I am currently on a gap year where I teach secondary school students how to make more sustainable choices. I also implemented a curriculum to educate the students on how to create systems that promote sustainability and equity. I run a blog talking about affordable and sustainable choices.


I am also very interested in the intersection between computer science/tech and the humanities. I am especially fascinated by how technology can be used to make the political process more transparent and accessible, like implementing electronic voting. I hope to continue exploring how technology can continue to intersect with other fields to create sustainable systems in Nigeria.

,"Fat, neuro-diverse, and queer would be the foremost words I would use to describe myself. Apart from being a student who just graduated high school, I am a fellow at Global Citizen Year Academy, Young Leaders for Active Citizenship, Civics Unplugged, and One Future Collective. When I am not working on creating solution-based news for school kids in my role as Outreach Manager at Via News Didi, you can find me writing articles for YKA, watching movies and dramas, listening to K-Pop, or procrastinating.


Being queer and seeing resistance all around me just because I identify as something that is not conventionally in society's imagination made me feel even more rebellious. Writing articles in the Justicemakers Writer's Training Program under Youth Ki Awaaz was my first time channeling that inner rebel and churning out words out of my experiences and my pain and since then I haven't stopped writing. As a queer student what I felt inside the school or as a recent high school graduate what I felt about the rat race for colleges or as an avid movie watcher what I feel about certain of them are the catalyst for my writing. Writing, thus, often has been a space to unburden my inner feelings in the form of words. Writing and even painting are forms of rebellion for me.


The line between personal and political for me is blurred. My hobbies are a representation of my political views. May it be painting which in turn turned into a weapon when I was featured on the Queer Muslim Project’s page with an artwork series on online safety for queer people. May it be reading which turned political when I created a book club under Belongg Library Network that focused on representing Indian women authors into the spotlight. May it be writing, may it be movie watching, or even listening to songs, there is little that anyone does that is not somehow a form of advocacy.


I consider myself a rebellious teenager. Maybe that’s why I have tried to make other teenagers who work in Via News Didi be open about their views however wild they might be. As part of our “Re-imagining Media Program”, I mentored 26 kids to understand fake news and about courageous journalism practices. As part of GCYA, exploring community building around gender sensitization and the need for the introduction of gender studies and sex education in the Indian curriculum is the focus of my social impact proposal. One Future Fellowship for me is the gateway into feminist leadership and the cornerstones of feminist theories. My teenage years even now are filled with exploring different my own space in the gender spectrum and advocating for a society beyond the binary.",Sahil Pradhan,sahilpradhan1109@gmail.com,demigodofpaints#1633,0x9be70af48A7885E0A7Bd4457186C30E5CC69317e,Active Voting Member,S3 Builder 🧑‍🚀,Gatherings 🫂,Bhubaneswar,"September 11, 2004",,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahil-pradhan-6a328a231/,they/them,
https://twitter.com/SamRadOfficial,"Hello there! I am Sam Rad. I don't even know where to start with the story of how my journey intersected with this new way of thinking, living, and collarborating. It was probably long before I got into tech as an entrepeneur. I was always questioning about how we could do things differently, shape a different reality, manifest the future. My background was actually in theater (as a writer, performer, and director) where I created a NYC based theater company for senior citizens 65+ to participate in plays that addressed socially relevant issues. I expanded this to all demographics, and incorporated tech. During that time, I was finishing my undergrad degree in anthropology and wrote my thesis on the virtual world, Second Life. I came across digital assets, bitcoin, and the ideas of decentralization and my mind was blown. I ended up on a PhD track to research virtual economies (in 2011) but started a company and, well, 3 companies in blockchain/web 3/crypto and here I am today. I found that over the years, my super power has been educating about the WHY of web 3 because so many folks would dive deep into the what it is, how it works, without showing WHY we need it. I ended up joining Singularity University in 2017 for blockchain faculty, have continued my research and participation in DAOs, give keynotes around the world, and have written an introductory guide called Bitcoin Pizza: The No-Bullshit Guide to Blockchain. I'm now the CEO of a Web 3 Communication Platform called LOVE, which aims to decentralize and democratize personal communications (and take on the Facebook monopoly!). We believe communication platforms (and the internet) should be a public utility. My super power is being a storyteller and catalyzer. I can equal gravitas stand on a stage as a keynote speaker or behind the stage as a director and empower folks into action. (If I believe in and my values align with the cause). As I have reflected over the years, I've realized that this shift in my consciousness is something that will never change and I will work the rest of my life to advocate, educate, and empower folks to imagine new models of cooperative governance, value creation, and more.",Sam Rad,samantha.radocchia@gmail.com,Sam Rad#5213,0xa9BfDBC5639D18876b67c583d39Cae7cE63FAAfc,Active Voting Member,"Founding Champion 🏆 ",,New York City,,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/samantharadocchia/,she/her,
