# Daksh Khanna

About me: My name is Daksh, and I am an Afghan person who is born and raised in the Netherlands. I love writing and reading poetry, dancing, and cycling in the dunes next to the beach in order to relax. I live at home with my parents, who support me in exploring my identity and passions. By studying at an Online School since 2022, I have had a lot of time to devote to my activities in social justice, for example, volunteering with UNICEF to work on enhancing teenage mental health in the Netherlands. I find their mission very beautiful, as mental health encompasses everyone’s life: work, hanging out with friends, and academic life. The latter, education, is my biggest passion yet. In 2021, I did a research project on why the Dutch secondary school system was (and is) failing. Different issues were explored, including inequality in academic freedom and passion for learning and creativity being discarded. In the future, I will work to improve the equality that is built during the education of a teenager in high schools worldwide.
