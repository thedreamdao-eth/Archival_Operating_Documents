# Cameron (Cam) Chase

About me: My name is Cam Chase, I am nineteen and am from Bellingham, Washington. At the moment, I am a student at the University of Utah who is majoring in an Honors Bachelor of Science in English. I love to write, and aspire to be a content creator on the internet. I also am working as a content writer at the Sorenson Impact Center, which is a major group based at my university which produces reports and does data analysis on impact-based programs for philanthropists, non-profits, and impact investors. I am very interested in politics and "impact" and really want to find a community of other young people who also want to make a difference with their work. I also am super interested in traveling, and am about to embark on a five-month long trip to Europe, where I will be studying in Florence as well as at Oxford University. My absolute dream job involves all of my passions, writing, traveling, and impact, and I am currently searching for the best path to that!
