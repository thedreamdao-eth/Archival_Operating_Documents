# Aabhas Senapathi

About me: I am 17 y.o. a young social-entrepreneur from Ahmedabad, India with the vision to change the mindset of people, I strive to reform education.
I run a start-up ThingFinder(tag-device to help Alzheimer patients & elderly keep track of their day-to-day objects), which is incubated at GUSEC, and have raised about $4000 in grants for it.

Having participated in 20+ international hackathons and won 7 (3 MIT-Challenges), I have got to expand my network and furnish my skills. And through global communities, I have been able to expand my horizon of perspectives.
I have worked through Social Entrepreneurship and Hardware-Development, to devise solutions towards solving issues of Alzheimer‚Äôs, Mental-Health, Data-Bias in Clinical-Research, Emergency Safety, Accessibility of Health-Care & Education.
I have been working as an advisory board member of UNICEF‚Äôs Young People‚Äôs Action Team, to raise voices of youth in policy advocacy and applying efforts like YoungWarrior Movement at the grass-root level. And it has been great being a bridge between youth and UNICEF.

I am also part of Human Impacts Institute's Youth Advisory Council, working towards climate artivism and youth advocacy for the same.
I also sometimes blog with friends, exchanging views on socio-psychological issues to bring a positive impact, and also have community discussion to burst my own bubbles and learn new perspective of the world to navigate better. Here on https://beyondbubble.org/
I feel that ‚ÄúEverything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler‚Äù. In life, satisfaction is the key, and you can get satisfaction by giving rather than taking, this is what keeps me motivated to improve the world.
I believe creating an impact depends on changing mindsets, best achieved through ‚Äútrue education‚Äù. I want to work towards implementing this change I envision. I believe that although the world has many intelligent people, it needs wise people mostly because the attitude and effective implementation matters even more than innovation. Implementation is more important and relevant than knowing. I think that we need to realize that death is the ultimate truth of life and need to embrace the uncertainty, which will help us be much more benevolent and treat everyone better to make it a better place. And one of the best tools to achieve the same is through Openness and Benevolence, and I beleive that being decentralised (i.e. amall local quanta interconnected to each other), whoch would greta significantly to step out of echo chambers through tools like AI, and benevolence being gimbibed through our educations systems would ensure that we as humanity contribute our bit to the larger shceme of universe.
I am also one of the 100 RISE Global Winners, who will be supported for a lifetime from education to social initiatives by Schmidt Futures and Rhodes Trust to create impact in their communities.

Recently I have been doing a research internship at IIT Gandhingagar, where I have been working on electronics and hardware end to develop accesible lung health diagnostic devices through masks using sensors to monitor breath data using microphones and carbon dioxide sensors.

My fascination has particualrly been around intersection of Entrpreneurship, Hardware Technology and Philosophy, more specifically learning science and innovation through the lens of philosophy to ensure that intent meets it's impact, and "effective altruism" through benevolence and openness can be practiced. I particularly feels inspired through the ocncept of Oneness, and how we are part of the greater conciousness and destiny and how this transience in life, can help us to develop fearless optimisim and give our best.
Here's my TEDx Talk below where is hare about my steps of developing a vision beyond bubbles for life and how I want to go about creating that impact I envision.
TEDx Talk ‚Äì https://to.aabhass.in/ted
‚ÄúDoing what most of us failed to, Master Aabhas Senapati has turned these pandemic ridden 18 months into a process of figuring out how to burst bubbles, see beyond and contribute to humanity as an asset; telling us to peer past the selfishness and how lending aid to even one may spike into a butterfly effect of positivity. Looking over the repetition of setting one goal after the other, he sheds light on the value of finding a true purpose in life by aligning milestones that lead up to it. Through changing mindsets, preaching the necessity of wiseness over intelligence is how his vision comes close to completion.‚Äù
