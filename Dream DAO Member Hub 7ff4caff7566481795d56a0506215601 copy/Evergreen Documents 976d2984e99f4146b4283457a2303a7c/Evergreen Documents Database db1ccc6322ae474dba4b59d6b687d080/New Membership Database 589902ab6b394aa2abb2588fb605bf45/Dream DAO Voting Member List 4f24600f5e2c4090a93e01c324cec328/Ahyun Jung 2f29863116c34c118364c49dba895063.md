# Ahyun Jung

About me: I'm a 16-year-old activist and advocate for empowering everyone in combating global crises together, especially in tackling poverty and malnutrition, climate change, abuse, and the improvement of education. I don't have deep knowledge on web3 and how it can create social impact, but I am intrigued by how we can harness various tools to make positive change, especially with rapidly evolving ways of interaction and increasing threats of monopolisation in the industry.
