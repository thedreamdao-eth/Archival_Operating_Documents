# Thainá Silva de Paula Theodoro

About me: I am a self-starter passionate about youth development. My main interests are product development, product management and community development. While my main causes are women's, gender, sexuality and health (with an emphasis on education). As an alumna from Latin American Leadership Academy and over 4+ years of philanthropic work, I have directly impacted over 70,000 youths around the globe. I have my own non-profit, called Sem Medo, which recently has started a new path with MIT Solv[ED], there I teach sex education to the Brazilian youth. My job is being a community manager at Força Meninas, an organization that in the last year has helped over 30 thousand girls aged 6 to 21 in their educational and professional paths. Next year, in March I will be partaking in the Take Action Lab in South Africa with a full-ride scholarship, where I will better my understanding of philantropy.
