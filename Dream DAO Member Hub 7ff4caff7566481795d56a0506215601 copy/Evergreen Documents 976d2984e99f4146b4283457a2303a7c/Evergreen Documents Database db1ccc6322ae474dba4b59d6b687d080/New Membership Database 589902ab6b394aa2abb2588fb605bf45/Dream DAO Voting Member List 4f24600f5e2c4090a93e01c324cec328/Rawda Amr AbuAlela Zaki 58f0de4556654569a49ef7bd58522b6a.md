# Rawda Amr AbuAlela Zaki

About me: It's Rawda, a young Muslim woman, launching to begin my 20s. I am an undergraduate student majoring in Sociology. I have diverse interests outside of university, from scientific research and the entanglement of data science with artificial intelligence and quantum computing that drives it all. I work in the field of climate research in the Middle East with LINGO, which aims to isolate the use of fossil fuels that raise the climate temperature. Recently, I volunteered as a student researcher at IEEE Cairo University Student Branch in the fields of science, journalism and communications. I also volunteered last summer with Dr. Aditya at the Summer Stanford Session as a Climate Researcher in a research study aimed at raising children's awareness of the scientific material taught about climate and the Earth in general. Ultimately, I am a bilingual Arabic and English storyteller, I have strong knowledge of managing the content industry as I worked on it during my training at global citizen year.org.
