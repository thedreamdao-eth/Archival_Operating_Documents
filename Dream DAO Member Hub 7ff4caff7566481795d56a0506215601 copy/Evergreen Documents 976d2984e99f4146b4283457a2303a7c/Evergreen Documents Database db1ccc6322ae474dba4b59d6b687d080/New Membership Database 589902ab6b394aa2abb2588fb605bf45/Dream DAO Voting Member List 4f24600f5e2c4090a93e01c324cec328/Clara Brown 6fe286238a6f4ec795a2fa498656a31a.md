# Clara Brown

About me: I am a passionate coder and am always looking for ways to explore new coding languages and technology. I recently attended the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program (SIP) and am familiar with multiple coding languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, and Scratch. I also volunteer with multiple organizations like YOUNGO, UNICEF, Plan International, and UN MGCY, including the Canadian Association for Girls in Science (CAGIS) who bring STEM topics and opportunities to young girls and gender non-conforming youth eager to pursue topics like coding. I am an associate board member of Coding for All, an association dedicated to providing girls with fun opportunities to participate in coding activities.
