# Kabir Burman

About me: Ask anyone about me at school or any of my colleagues at work and they’ll tell you that I love to talk. Whether it was when working with one of India’s first digital museums or when I interned as a high school student at a national newspaper and during the course of my tenure as Editor-in-Chief of my school magazine, I have steadily developed this ability to communicate with everyone and anyone at any given time. 

From representing and understanding a myriad of different national interests, each unlike the previous for my school’s Model United Nations team, to working with delegates and government representatives at the United Nations Development Programme, I have come to understand how much our world depends not only on the ability to speak loudly and clearly of one’s own view, but also listening and understanding opposing perspectives.  

In coordinating student run organizations which advocate for better access to mental health resources and ridding the stigma around the traditionally taboo topic, to writing for international journalists and highlighting the unseen, I have developed a passion for not only bringing light to these issues around the world–but also becoming the voice of those that cannot speak for themselves.
