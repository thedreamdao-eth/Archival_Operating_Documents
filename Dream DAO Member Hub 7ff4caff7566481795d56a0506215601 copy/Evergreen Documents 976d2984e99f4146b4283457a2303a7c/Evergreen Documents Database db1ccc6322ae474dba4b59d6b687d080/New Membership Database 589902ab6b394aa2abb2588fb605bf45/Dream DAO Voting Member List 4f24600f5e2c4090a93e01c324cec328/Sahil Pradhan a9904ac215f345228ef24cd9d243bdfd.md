About me: Fat, neuro-diverse, and queer would be the foremost words I would use to describe myself. Apart from being a student who just graduated high school, I am a fellow at Global Citizen Year Academy, Young Leaders for Active Citizenship, Civics Unplugged, and One Future Collective. When I am not working on creating solution-based news for school kids in my role as Outreach Manager at Via News Didi, you can find me writing articles for YKA, watching movies and dramas, listening to K-Pop, or procrastinating.


Being queer and seeing resistance all around me just because I identify as something that is not conventionally in society's imagination made me feel even more rebellious. Writing articles in the Justicemakers Writer's Training Program under Youth Ki Awaaz was my first time channeling that inner rebel and churning out words out of my experiences and my pain and since then I haven't stopped writing. As a queer student what I felt inside the school or as a recent high school graduate what I felt about the rat race for colleges or as an avid movie watcher what I feel about certain of them are the catalyst for my writing. Writing, thus, often has been a space to unburden my inner feelings in the form of words. Writing and even painting are forms of rebellion for me.


The line between personal and political for me is blurred. My hobbies are a representation of my political views. May it be painting which in turn turned into a weapon when I was featured on the Queer Muslim Project‚Äôs page with an artwork series on online safety for queer people. May it be reading which turned political when I created a book club under Belongg Library Network that focused on representing Indian women authors into the spotlight. May it be writing, may it be movie watching, or even listening to songs, there is little that anyone does that is not somehow a form of advocacy.


I consider myself a rebellious teenager. Maybe that‚Äôs why I have tried to make other teenagers who work in Via News Didi be open about their views however wild they might be. As part of our ‚ÄúRe-imagining Media Program‚Äù, I mentored 26 kids to understand fake news and about courageous journalism practices. As part of GCYA, exploring community building around gender sensitization and the need for the introduction of gender studies and sex education in the Indian curriculum is the focus of my social impact proposal. One Future Fellowship for me is the gateway into feminist leadership and the cornerstones of feminist theories. My teenage years even now are filled with exploring different my own space in the gender spectrum and advocating for a society beyond the binary.
