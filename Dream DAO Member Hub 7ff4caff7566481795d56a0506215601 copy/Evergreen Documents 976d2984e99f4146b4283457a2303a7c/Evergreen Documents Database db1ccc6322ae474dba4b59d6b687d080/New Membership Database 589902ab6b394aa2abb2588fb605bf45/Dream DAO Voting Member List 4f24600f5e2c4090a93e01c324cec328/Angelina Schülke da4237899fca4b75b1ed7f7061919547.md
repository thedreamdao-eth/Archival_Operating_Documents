# Angelina Sch√ºlke

About me: One month ago, I left the small village in the south of Germany where I had grown up and moved to Berlin for an internship at a foundation in the education sector. My initial intention was to gain some work experience in the foundation and non-profit area as well as help organize workshops that would help students from non-academic backgrounds to find their dream major and navigate the college application process. What I didn‚Äôt imagine, though, is how valuable and transformative this whole experience would actually be. Taking a gap year has given me the opportunity to finally immerse myself in everything I‚Äôm interested in ‚Äì ranging from art over philosophy to linguistics, community building and democracy ‚Äì and to start looking at a bigger picture through drawing new connections between those topics. What drives me is the fascination for interdisciplinary questions. And this is also why the Dream DAO has caught my attention. 

Combining web3 and social impact means connecting the dots in a different way. It means raising questions and ideas that extend and challenge my thinking and that is exactly what I was looking for in my gap year. While I haven‚Äôt really had the chance to learn something about web3 before, I am convinced that web3 paired with social impact purposes has an enormous potential for the future. Civics Unplugged has inspired me to give back to society and I would like to spread this spirit among other young people as well. That‚Äôs why I am determined to be on the forefront of this innovative path and help design it, instead of just sitting in the sidelines watching someone else attempting to do so.
