# Luis Gustavo Heredia Vasquez

About me: I'm Luis, a teacher by heart, a learner of life, and an aspiring social entrepreneur.  When people hear my name I want to be remembered as a connector of dreams, as someone who brings joy, with a joke,  amidst the sadness, and the person who can open students' eyes to opportunities.  As a First Generation student, I work closely with low-income teens to give them the resources to succeed. In order to do so, I’m learning constantly from their perspectives by volunteering in international organizations and working on social projects. Indeed, since 2020 I have been leading a youth organization that has helped underprivileged students to learn English and boost their socioemotional skills. Because of my civic engagement, I have got some recognition:

Selected as one of the 34 Global Teen Leaders by We Are Family Foundation, in a pool of more than 500 applications, for my social innovation Edulimitless and contribution to shaping a better world. (2022)
Selected as a Young challenger by The Grameen Creative Lab (GCL), founded by Muhammad  Yunus-Nobel Peace Prize.  Got one of the 40 full scholarships to pitch a business idea in Italy out of 200 applicants. (2022)
