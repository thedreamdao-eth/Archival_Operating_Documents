# Aishah binte Syamsul Bahri

About me: My name is Aishah, and I'm currently 17 specializing in accountancy and finance.
I care about equal opportunities and fair treatment as best as possible. I consider myself a people person because I love interacting with new people. I will try to use that connection with people and build friendships and networks while at the same time discussing what I love with like-minded people. I find it always motivating to see teenagers my age make such a big difference in society. This is my motivation to keep pushing myself and remember that I should have faith to continue by educating myself on various issues and even starting projects. Web3 is a new aspect I'm willing to explore and learn.
