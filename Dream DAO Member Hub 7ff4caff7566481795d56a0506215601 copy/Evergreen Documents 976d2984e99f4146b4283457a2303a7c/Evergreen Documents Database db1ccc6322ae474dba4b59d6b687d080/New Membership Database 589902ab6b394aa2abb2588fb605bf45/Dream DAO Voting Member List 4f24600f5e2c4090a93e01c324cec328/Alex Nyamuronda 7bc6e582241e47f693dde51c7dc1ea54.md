# Alex Nyamuronda

About me: I am a teenager from Zimbabwe who loves traveling, exploring and learning new things, meeting and interacting with new people, supporting others and having fun. I have main interests in media, business, science and technology. I am focused, intelligent, smart and very responsible. I am an aspiring businessman with a lot of business plans up my sleeve and also I have got a lot of plans for inventions and broadcasts as I am interested in Media and sciences also. I am also into sports like chess, soccer, valleyball and athletics. I care about my environment and the people living in it, so my worries evolve global warming and other environmental and technological hazards. Though I care a lot about these and other things I have little access to opportunities that can develop me into a better person to tackle the problems, and seeing such an opportunity like yours has given me hepe that Chang is possible.
