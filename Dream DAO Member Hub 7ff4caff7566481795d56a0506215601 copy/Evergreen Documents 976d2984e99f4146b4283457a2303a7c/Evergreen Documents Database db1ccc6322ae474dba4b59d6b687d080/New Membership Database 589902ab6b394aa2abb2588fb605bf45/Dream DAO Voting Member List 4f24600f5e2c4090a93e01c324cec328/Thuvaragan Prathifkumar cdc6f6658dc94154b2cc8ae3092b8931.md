# Thuvaragan Prathifkumar

About me: I am Thuvaragan Prathifkumar, a grade 11 AP student at Central Peel Secondary School in Ontario, Canada! As an AP student, I love to challenge myself. I am passionate about technology and currently taking any opportunity to expand my knowledge in the tech realm. I have dived into AI and Machine Learning ever since it peaked my interest. I am an AI Lead at App Dev League where I have done many things such as hosting AI workshops for hackathons, one on one mentoring, creating content for the curriculum. I have delved into Game Development with Unity and with my co-op over the summer I have done some iOS App Development. I aspire to become a software engineer so as a tech enthusiast I spent my time researching new technologies so I could be innovative and make contributions to society. I have also been to hackathons so I can use my passion for technology to contribute to my community by creating useful solutions such as apps.
