# Kanha Korgaonkar

About me: I'm a 16 year old high school student and technologist from Mumbai, India. Having built multiple hackathon winning projects using web2 technologies, I'm now learning and building in web3 (more on that later). I like describing myself as a technooptimist - I strongly believe in web3 and its capacity to revolutionize our society. In my free time, I learn, run my nonprofit, volunteer, organize events, and work for the causes I care about: community, sustainability and accessibility.
