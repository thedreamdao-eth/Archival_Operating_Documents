About me: I am a Mexican activist, currently focused on the education system and women's rights in my country. My main activities in recent years have been to turn around the Mexican youth with a vision and learning towards financial education, mental health, self-knowledge and leadership. On the other hand, I am concerned about women's rights and eradicating an unfortunate problem that still exists in the world, female genital mutilation.

My main activities in recent years have been to turn around the Mexican youth with a vision and learning towards financial education, mental health, self-knowledge and leadership. On the other hand, I am concerned about women's rights and eradicating an unfortunate problem that still exists in the world, female genital mutilation. I think that being able to solve these problems and help these causes motivate me in my day-to-day life and has defined me as the person I am now and the person I want to become in the future. Making a difference and the power that we have shown the youth in these last generations.
