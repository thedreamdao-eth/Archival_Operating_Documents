# Bhavesh Gupta

About me: I am Bhavesh Gupta from India. I am a Sophomore at Indian Institute of technology, BHU, India. I am pursuing my B.tech degree in Mathematics and Computing. In past I have worked as full stack developer and made some projects. Then I shifted to Web3 as I found it quite interesting and i believe this technology has a great future ahead. Exploring this field I got to know about 'Dream Dao' and its contribution to use web3 along with creating a social impact. I also feel that building a technology with a positive impact on society is must for wellness of every individual or community.
