# Gabriela Zanolini Pisarewski Mois√©s

About me: I am an always-in-movement, ambitious, systematic, and critical teen. From books to volunteering to programs, I aim to find an ethical and personal growth path that combines social impact, advocacy, and deep research (in technology and politics/economy). But mainly, nowadays, I care about public policy in Brazilian cities. 
For +2 years journey, I have dug into social impact and team leadership. I engaged in 21st education (community engagement leader), conscious young entrepreneurship (director of a +500 ex-participants community of entrepreneurship), and women‚Äôs health (tampons raising) in my city. This program showed governance issues that shocked me to wanna change that I see as a technology and innovation consequence. a technology and social innovation learning journey started for me. Nowadays, I am a quantum computing course student and a New York Academy of Sciences Young Member, studying critical thinking.
More than my passions and purpose, between studies and programs, I find myself discussing the world with my dad, puzzling, reading classical books, and watching series. I am all the deep conversations I have with people and my biggest discoveries of the world.
