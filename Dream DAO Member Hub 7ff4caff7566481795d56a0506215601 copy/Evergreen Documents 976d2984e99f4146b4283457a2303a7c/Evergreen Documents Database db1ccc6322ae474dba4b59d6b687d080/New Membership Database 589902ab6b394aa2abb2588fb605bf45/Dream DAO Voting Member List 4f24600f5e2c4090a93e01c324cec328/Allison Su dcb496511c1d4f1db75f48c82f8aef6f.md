# Allison Su

About me: Hi! My name is Allison. I use she/her pronouns. I am a high school junior currently residing in Cleveland, Ohio. Besides being a student, I do a ton of volunteering in organizations that aim to create a better future such as educating the world on issues relating to social justice, spreading awareness, and as well helping campaigning, doing projects in hopes that we can change the future generations by being more compassionate and understanding each other. I want to explore the intersection of web3 and social impact because I find it very fascinating on how we can leverage cryptocurrency/NFT to allow Gen Z to access funding and as well create change in the world through it.
