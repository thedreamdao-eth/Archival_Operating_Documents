# Aaryan Chadha

About me: I'm Aaryan Chadha, a 16 y/o from India who's very into physics and tech and been exploring a lot of different stuff in both those fields. Apart from attending school I spend my time coding, playing a lot of video games, writing, and reading anything I can get my hands on. I've also gotten into entrepreneurship and am currently building my own passion project called Buildr (not up yet). I'm a published author, an innovator at The Knowledge Society, Young Researcher at New York Academy of Sciences and just officially became an alum of Civics Unplugged where I wrote my case brief on blockchain!! Currently my main areas of interest have been AI and I've built some cool projects such as a CV-based posture correction system and am currently building an AI to detect microplastics in food. Apart from just using tech to improve people's lives (mine too haha), I love to build cool stuff (although I try to make it a little useful at least) and when working on a very long-term project to use user data to create hyper-personalised gaming worlds, I came across how web3 would integrate into that (and knew I had to get into this space!) My main goal in life is to build something that can positively impact billions and I think web3 is the right place to start!
