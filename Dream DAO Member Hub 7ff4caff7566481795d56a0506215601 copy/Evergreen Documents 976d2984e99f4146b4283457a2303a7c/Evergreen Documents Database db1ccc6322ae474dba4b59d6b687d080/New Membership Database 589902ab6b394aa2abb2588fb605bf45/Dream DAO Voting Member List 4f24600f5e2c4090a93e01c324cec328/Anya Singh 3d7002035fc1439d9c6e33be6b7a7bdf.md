About me: I enjoy building things and working on new projects. Recently, I've been reading a lot of papers and having interesting conversations with people on pilotting projects and finding first principles causes of world problems. At the moment, I care a lot about the climate. As I'm developing my skills in ML and AI, I've worked on a few projects including a tool to synthesize undercited climate reports and a graph neural network to model global weather. The project I'm working on now is a way to improve the discovery of catalysts for chemical reactions to increase the use of renewable energy.
