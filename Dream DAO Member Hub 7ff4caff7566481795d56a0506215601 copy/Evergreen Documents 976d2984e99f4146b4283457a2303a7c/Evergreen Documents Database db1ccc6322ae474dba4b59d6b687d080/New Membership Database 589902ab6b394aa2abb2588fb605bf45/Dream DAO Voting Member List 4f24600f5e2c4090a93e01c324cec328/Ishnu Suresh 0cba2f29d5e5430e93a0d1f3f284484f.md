# Ishnu Suresh

About me: Hey there! My name is Ishnu Suresh and I’m a grade 11 AP student at Central Peel Secondary School in Ontario, Canada! Currently, I’m passionate about the field of Technology, and work towards any opportunity to learn and expand my knowledge with said field. I’ve been interested in Technology, and its applications within the real world since the Ninth grade. I’ve explored many different sub-categories of development within the realm of technology such as Web Development, iOS App Development, Game Development and Machine Learning and AI. I’m currently an AI Instructor at App Dev League, where I’ve had the amazing opportunity to mentor students and construct lessons and articles for the curriculum. I’ve always loved to learn new things and topics, and share that knowledge with others, and I’m able to do that as an AI Instructor. I’m working towards becoming a Software Engineer and creating my own start-up, and so, I jump at any possibility to learn new things within the field of technology.
