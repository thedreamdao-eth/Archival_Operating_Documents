# Sara Yamba

About me: I am Sara Yamba. An aspiring changemaker and transformational leader. My goal is to bring change into the world by overcoming the injustice that plague myself and the people of my kind in today's society. I happen to be a congolese refugee, and due to this factor I have experienced the type of limitations I did not know was possible with the 4th Industrial Revolution around the corner. But because I have now understood that all my minorities make me stronger I have decided to stand up. Now, what I do is change. I fight injustice. I advocate for my all my minorities that make me who I am. I do this because I care about the scary, growing number of African refugees who have not realised what I have realised. That change is possible and they can overcome whaterver injustice they are faced with too. I do this because I was a part of that number and so were my family members and closest friends. I am a person who is excited for change because its the only way to break the cycle that many refugee women and myself were born into.
