# David Golden

About me: I have recently developed an interest in how I can make a difference in fostering a more sustainable lifestyle in my school. I was given the position of co-president of the Sustainable Living Club at my school, a club which seeks to inspire the student body to break down sustainable living into personal and practical steps which students would feel empowered to take. The club also seeks to inspire students to care about their environment through mindfulness and reflection. Iam deeply passionate about raising awareness on the importance of sustainable living in the survival of the earth.
