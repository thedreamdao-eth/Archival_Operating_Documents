# Gabrielle Oliveira

About me: I'm Gabrielle from Brazil, I’m 18 and my pronouns are she/her. Currently, one of my biggest passions is programming. Not just the act of programming, but the act of creating games from scratch and sending a positive message to people. I believe that everything around us is art, and games bring a very interactive way of touching us throughout both our best and worst moments. During the last two years, I've been learning to interact with different programming languages, participating in some hackathons, and even winning some. Additionally, I am involved in LGBTQIA+ advocacy and, in the future, I hope to increase queer representation within games and animations, as the current industry still harbors traits of discrimination and inequality. My goal in the game industry is to build a fantasy where anyone could see themselves in it and communicate a nice message while doing so. Last but not least, I am also involved in climate activism and had participated in two organizations that do a great job of spreading reliable information on their media.
