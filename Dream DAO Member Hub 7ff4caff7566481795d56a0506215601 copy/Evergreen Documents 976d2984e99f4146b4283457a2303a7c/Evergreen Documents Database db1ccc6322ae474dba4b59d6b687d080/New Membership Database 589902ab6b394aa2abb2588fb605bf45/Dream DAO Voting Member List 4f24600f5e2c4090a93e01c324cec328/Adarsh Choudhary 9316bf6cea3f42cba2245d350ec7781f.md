# Adarsh Choudhary

About me: I am a gap year student currently exploring new things for myself and working on developing a project for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. In the next few days, I will be graduating from a Gap Year leadership academy which is Global Citizen Year Academy.

In the last 11 months, I worked and been involved in developing myself and my community on the understanding of social impact. I am new to the web3 thing and eager to learn more about it.
