# Oluwanifemi Ibrahim

About me: I'm a Nigerian interested in climate change advocacy and environmental sustainability. As an aspiring environmental engineer, I am passionate about designing sustainable technologies that are accessible in economically vulnerable communities, especially those in third-world countries. I am passionate about youth mobilization and empowerment. I am currently on a gap year where I teach secondary school students how to make more sustainable choices. I also implemented a curriculum to educate the students on how to create systems that promote sustainability and equity. I run a blog talking about affordable and sustainable choices.


I am also very interested in the intersection between computer science/tech and the humanities. I am especially fascinated by how technology can be used to make the political process more transparent and accessible, like implementing electronic voting. I hope to continue exploring how technology can continue to intersect with other fields to create sustainable systems in Nigeria.


In my free time, I love listening to afro beats and watching an unhealthy amount of documentaries.
