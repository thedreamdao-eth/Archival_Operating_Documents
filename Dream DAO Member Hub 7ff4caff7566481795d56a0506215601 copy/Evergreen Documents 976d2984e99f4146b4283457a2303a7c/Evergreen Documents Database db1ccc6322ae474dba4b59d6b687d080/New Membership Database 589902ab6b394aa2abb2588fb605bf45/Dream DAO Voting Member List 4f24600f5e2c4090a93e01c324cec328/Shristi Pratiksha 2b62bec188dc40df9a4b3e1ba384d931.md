# Shristi Pratiksha

About me: I am Shristi Pratiksha a 17 year old teenager from India, currently pursuing Law (B.B.A., LL.B(Hons.) from one of the top law colleges of India. I am currently the part of 'Hello World' as their Community Engagement Assistant and through this organisation I was able to meet and interview people like Dr. Phyllis Wakefield, Robyn Glaser (Senior Vice President of the Krafts Group). And also  go to know some amazing peers and about their organization and the work they're doing towards the thing that they're passionate about and making this world a better place. I care about mental health (currently in the process of opening up a mental health committee in my university) and aiming to work in eradicating injustices happening around the world. The thing that I am planning to work on in the sector of injustices is the cyber crimes (which are increasing rapidly nowadays) and with the introduction of new things such as crypto, AI and blockchain we would need laws to for the better regulation of these things. And so that others will not misuse these things and harm others.
