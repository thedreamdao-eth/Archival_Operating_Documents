# Rithika Karthikeyan

About me: Hi! My name is Rithika and I'm a junior at the International Academy East, which is an IB school in the US. From my experience, knowledge is the single most powerful tool one can utilize  and I'm dedicated to making access to educational opportunities equitable through advocacy and my own technology skillset. Outside of school, I love to paint, run, and cozy up with a good book. I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow both personally and professionally, whether it be while coaching middle school Science Olympiad teams or volunteering at my local HAVEN shelter. I'd love to put my technology skillset and passion for advocacy to use through the Dream DAO program and learn more about the impacts of web3 on creating positive change!
