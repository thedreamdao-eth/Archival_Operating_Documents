# Sruthi Pereddy

About me: Hi! My name is Sruthi and I'm a current junior at an IB school in the US. I consider numbers and code my first language and have a passion and eye for graphic design. Outside of school, you can find me cozied up with a good science fiction book or dreaming up initiatives to increase STEM education access in my local area. I hope to major in computer science and use those skills to create effective and lasting change in my community to help contribute to education reform.
