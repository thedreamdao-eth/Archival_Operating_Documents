# Amanda Garcia Maritan

About me: I am a CU 2030 Builder, passionate about politics, art and communication. I am currently a student, preparing myself for Film School and an aspiring writer. I am deeply motivated by the search for equity, which I believe we can achieve through education. I want, in the future, to have helped in the evolution of education. I believe, especially in my country, that education does not open as many doors as it should. Businesses and universities do not stand together on behalf of young students, and our education teaches us more about theories than practices that we use in everyday life in the real, common world. I believe that using web3 will be a way to innovate education, democratize knowledge that companies expect young students to have, share knowledge in politics and the arts (helping society to become less ignorant and more respectful), as well as enable our community to turn democracy into something more direct, in practice, rather than indirect, since we will be helping decentralize information from the huge capitalists companies.
