Just wanted to share that I just minted a SkywalkerZ NFT (which is an awesome new NFT collection that just dropped today). The money raised is going to the Dream DAO, whose mission is to train and fund Gen Zers seeking to leverage the power of web3 for social impact. SkywalkerZ NFT holders vote on which projects and people to fund. It's the brain child of an established 501(c)(3), Civics Unplugged, and is one of the most exciting web3 experiments I've seen so far! Check it out and join the party: [getskywalkerz.com](http://getskywalkerz.com)
