How many SkywalkerZ NFTs can I mint?,"You can mint up to 30 SkywalkerZ, up to 10 at at time. If you are accepted as a member of the Dream DAO, you must have 1 NFT to maintain membership, and additional NFTs do not give you more voting power."
"How do the NFTs work? ","Each NFT is unique, with different NFTs having different attributes (e.g. background, helmet, hat, chest plate) of different rarities.

Why are we giving a Gen Zer and NFT for every SkywalkerZ NFT minted,"For every SkywalkerZ NFT purchased, one SkywalkerZ NFT is given to an active member of CU’s existing Gen Z community to maintain an intergenerational balance of decision-making power and to ensure all members—older and younger—are all incentivized to contribute to the success of Civics Unplugged's youth-centered movement.

This system incentivizes Champions to hold their SkywalkerZ NFT(s), so that Gen Z members (called ""Builders"") will benefit from the rising asset value of the NFTs.

Giving Gen Zers NFTs is not just a great way to help them generate wealth, it also helps accelerate their financial literacy—especially of decentralized finance—by virtue of having skin in the game."
What is Civics Unplugged doing about the environmental impact of NFTs and Crypto?,"Civics Unplugged understands the impact NFTs and the crypto world has on the environment, and we are exploring methods of carbon offsetting to ensure our mining and DAO experiment does not cause damage to the world our Gen Z leaders will hold in their hands."

In Phase 2, the members of the Dream DAO will collectively review and select new members from applications. In Phase 3, membership is managed by a dedicated working group."
