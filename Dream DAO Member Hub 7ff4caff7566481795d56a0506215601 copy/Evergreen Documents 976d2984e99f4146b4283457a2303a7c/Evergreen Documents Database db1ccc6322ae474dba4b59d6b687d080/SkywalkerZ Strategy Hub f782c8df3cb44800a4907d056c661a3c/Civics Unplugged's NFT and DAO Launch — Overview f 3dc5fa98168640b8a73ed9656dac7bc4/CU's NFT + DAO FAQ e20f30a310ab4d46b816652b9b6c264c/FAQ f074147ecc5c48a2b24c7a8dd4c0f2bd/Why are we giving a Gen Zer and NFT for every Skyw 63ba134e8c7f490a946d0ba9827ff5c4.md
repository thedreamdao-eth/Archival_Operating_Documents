# Why are we giving a Gen Zer and NFT for every SkywalkerZ NFT minted

Answer: For every SkywalkerZ NFT purchased, one SkywalkerZ NFT is given to an active member of CU’s existing Gen Z community to maintain an intergenerational balance of decision-making power and to ensure all members—older and younger—are all incentivized to contribute to the success of Civics Unplugged's youth-centered movement.

This system incentivizes Champions to hold their SkywalkerZ NFT(s), so that Gen Z members (called "Builders") will benefit from the rising asset value of the NFTs.

Giving Gen Zers NFTs is not just a great way to help them generate wealth, it also helps accelerate their financial literacy—especially of decentralized finance—by virtue of having skin in the game.
