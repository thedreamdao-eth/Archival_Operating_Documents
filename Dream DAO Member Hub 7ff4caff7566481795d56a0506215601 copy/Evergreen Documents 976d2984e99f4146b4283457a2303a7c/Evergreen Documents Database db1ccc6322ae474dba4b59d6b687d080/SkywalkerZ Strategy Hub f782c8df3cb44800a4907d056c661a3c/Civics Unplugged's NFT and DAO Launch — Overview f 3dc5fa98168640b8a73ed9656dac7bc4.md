# The Overview

---

On October 11th, 2021, [Civics Unplugged](http://www.civicsunplugged.org) launched SkywalkerZ: CU's NFT collection whose proceeds will raise a **philanthropic fund dedicated to investing directly in Gen Z changemakers who are leveraging blockchain technology to build a brighter future across the globe.** 

Each NFT is priced at 0.1 ETH, and all proceeds will be held by the Dream DAO.

The Dream DAO is a first-of-its-kind intergenerational community of builders, investors, and thinkers committed to investing in the future. Members of the DAO will be able to collectively decide on who they want to award Dream DAO Grants to. Dream DAO Grants will be initially valued at 1 ETH.

Ownership of a SkywalkerZ NFT is required to become a member of the Dream DAO. Donors can still opt to just support the fund itself, without participating in its allocation. Additionally, donors who are interested in investing in the DAO, but not holding a SkywalkerZ NFT, can do so by contacting the CU Team directly.

üßëüèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ **Some examples of what the SkywalkerZ look like.**

Each SkywalkerZ is unique, and assembled from 100+ possible traits. The contracts are standard ERC-721 compatible with any Ethereum-based NFT exchange.

Supporters can purchase an NFT at [getskywalkerz.com](http://getskywalkerz.com). Almost every NFT is randomly assembled, but there are some pre-designed "legendary" 1:1 SkywalkerZ in the collection as well!

## The Dream DAO

---

The philanthropic fund raised from NFT purchases will be managed by the Dream DAO, whose members collectively decide to whom they want to award "Dream DAO Grants."

The value of each Dream DAO Grant is pegged at 10x the SkywalkerZ mint price‚Äîso if the price at the time is 0.1 ETH, the grant amount will be 1 ETH.

In addition to receiving a grant in the form of ETH, each grantee will be awarded a SkywalkerZ NFT, which secures their membership in the Dream DAO.

The idea behind a Dream DAO Grant is that it will provide a talented Gen Z leader with the financial freedom to launch their leadership journeys and build their dreams. There are no strings attached to the grant, unlike grants from almost any other grant-making institution.

For every SkywalkerZ NFT purchased, one SkywalkerZ NFT is given to an active member of CU‚Äôs existing Gen Z community to maintain an intergenerational balance of decision-making power. **A SkywalkerZ NFT is someone‚Äôs entry pass into the Dream DAO community.**

Civics Unplugged's existing community of thousands of young leaders around the world and extensive partner network will help curate potential grantees, until a DAO committee can be established. Grant proposals will be in a simple written or video format. 

Only 4,060 SkywalkerZ NFTs will ever be created: 2,030 for "Champions" of Gen Z leadership purchased through CU's official NFT-minting website, and 2,030 reserved for Gen Z members of the DAO.

We have designed the DAO such that the Gen Z members of our community always have significant voting power in the DAO.
