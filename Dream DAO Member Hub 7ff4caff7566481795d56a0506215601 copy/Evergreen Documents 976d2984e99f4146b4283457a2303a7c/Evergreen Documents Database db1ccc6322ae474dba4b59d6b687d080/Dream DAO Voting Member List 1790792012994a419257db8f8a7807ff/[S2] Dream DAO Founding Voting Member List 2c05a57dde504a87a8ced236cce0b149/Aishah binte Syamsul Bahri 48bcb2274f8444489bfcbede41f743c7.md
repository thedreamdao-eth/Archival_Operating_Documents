# Aishah binte Syamsul Bahri

About me: My name is Aishah and I'm currently 17 specialising in accountancy and finance.
I care about equal opportunities and fair treatment as best as possible. I would consider myself a people's person as I love talking haha and I try to use that connect with people and build friendships and networks while at the same time, discussing what I love with like minded people. I find it always motivating to see teenagers who are my age make such a big difference in society and this is my motivational drive to keep pushing myself and remember that I should have faith to continue be it educating myself on various issues and eve starting projects. Web3 is a whole new aspect that I'm willing to explore and learn.
