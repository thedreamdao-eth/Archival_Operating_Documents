Also, I'm co-founder of Next Web Capital, a crypto fund based in Singapore.
We focus on helping the new generation of Web3 entrepreneurs and being the best bridge between Asia and the rest of the world.
I have been contributing to the startup ecosystem for about 8 years as a member of a collective impact community called Mistletoe, founded by Mr. Taizo Son, brother of Mr. Masayoshi Son of Softbank. Mistletoe is working to solve social issues around the world with a long term vision. With what I learned there in mind, I started a Web3-specific community. The crypto industry has a strong short term thinking, but we are working for long term and public good in Japan and Asia.
