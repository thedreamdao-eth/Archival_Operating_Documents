# Seokhyun (Nathan) Baek

About me: For background, I'm Nathan, a 15-year-old rising junior located in South Korea. My interest lies in the intersection of diplomacy and social impact. I am also the Founder & CEO of the Microphone Initiative, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit specializing in expanding access to SDG education. Apart from all the professional shenanigans, I'm a person who takes passion and personality seriously. Self-discovery is what opened my eyes to civic responsibility and social impact. During the pursuit of passion, I discovered the importance of social impact and ultimately produced a product based off my personality. Although I was lucky enough to have an array of platforms to kick start my passion and social impact project thanks to COVID, not many Gen-Zers have the place to instill their passions and convert them to impact. I care about providing students and youth with a place to really adventure and juggle different things to pursue social impact.

Can help how?: I believe that using the Explorers Program can help introduce me to the field of contributing to web3 and using it to make a social impact. Moreover, I can make the best use of the IRL Web3 Gatherings as a place to dig deeper into the purpose of web3 and meet people with relevant interests to collaborate. Then, after experiencing a handful of these gatherings, perhaps I can become an asset that people can use to explore Dream DAO just like me.
