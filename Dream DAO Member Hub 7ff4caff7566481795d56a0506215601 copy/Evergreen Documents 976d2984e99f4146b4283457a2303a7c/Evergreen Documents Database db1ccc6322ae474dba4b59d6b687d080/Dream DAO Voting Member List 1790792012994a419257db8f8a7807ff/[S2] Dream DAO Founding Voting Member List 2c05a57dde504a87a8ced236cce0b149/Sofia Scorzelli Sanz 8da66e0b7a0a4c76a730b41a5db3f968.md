# Sofia Scorzelli Sanz

About me: I am a 15-year-old Brazilian-Argentinian interested in factors such as education innovation, diplomacy, climate change and preserving the environment. I care about helping the others, preserving the Earth and sending time with people I appreciate. I like playing tennis, reading, learning new languages and travelling. I speak Spanish fluently since I was 5 and started learning English since I was 3.

LinkedIn: Sofia Sanz
Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: I hosted a latin america hangout with Joshua, a founding builder, in CU! It is the first experience I have ever had in virtual community organising and I loved it
Fellowship cohort: Spring 2022
What's your birthday?: May 15, 2007
Can help how?: The Dream DAO could introduce me to many people from different places with similar perspectives to mine. I could work with them and learn from their experiences. The Learning Togheter sessions would show me how powerful the web3 is and teach me more about it. THE IRL Regen Web3 Gatherings will allow me to live my love of travelling and get to speak at different conferences and lots of insights on how Blockchain and sustainability can get along. Getting opportunities to work in working groups will allow me to scale my skills in coordination, events management and community building, and thus subsequently promote my interests in community organising, not just in real life, but also in virtual settings. Finally with lots of experiences and stores that I would get to hear with my friends throughout season 2, I'll get to apply my learning and working experiences, with the internship programme of the Dream DAO.
