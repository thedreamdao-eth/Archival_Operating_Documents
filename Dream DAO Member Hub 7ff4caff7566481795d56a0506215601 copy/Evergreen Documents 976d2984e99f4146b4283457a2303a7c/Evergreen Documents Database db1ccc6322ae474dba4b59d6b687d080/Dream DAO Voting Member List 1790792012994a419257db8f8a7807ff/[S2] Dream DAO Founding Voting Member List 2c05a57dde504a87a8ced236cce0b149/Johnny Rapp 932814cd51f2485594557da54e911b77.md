# Johnny Rapp

About me: I am a professional memer turned human rights activist who utilizes his deep psychological understanding of technology to globalize holistically nurturing spaces and infrastructure. My journey started in 2011 when I created a network of entertaining social media accounts and meme pages that grew to reach over a billion impressions each month by 2016. I now make use of my digital networks to popularize projects and causes I care about more effectively and globally. My main goal is to use his vast network and resources to build a ‚ÄúSolarPunk‚Äù world. SolarPunk is an aesthetic and concept that perfectly demonstrates our ideal world experience. SolarPunk organizations are about working together to make the world a better place throughout our lives, and that's what I plan to do. A better world is possible through our collective attention, action, and creativity.
