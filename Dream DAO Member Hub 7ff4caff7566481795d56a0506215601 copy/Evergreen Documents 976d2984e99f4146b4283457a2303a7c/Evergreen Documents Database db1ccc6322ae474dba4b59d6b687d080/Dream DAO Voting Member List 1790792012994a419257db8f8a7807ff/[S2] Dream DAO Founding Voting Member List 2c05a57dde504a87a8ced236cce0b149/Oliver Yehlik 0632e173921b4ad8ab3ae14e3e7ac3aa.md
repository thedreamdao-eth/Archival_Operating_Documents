# Oliver Yehlik

About me: I am a 17-year-old student from Minnesota who is interested in learning nearly everything. A seven-word bio that describes what I often find myself thinking about is "practically applying philosophy to humanity's greatest challenges." While many people think of philosophy as isolated and abstract, I think it is truly powerful when practiced together in a concrete way. Especially by focusing in on our communities and communication, we can become more effective in making change while better understanding the principles that drive us. I think there could be a lot of potential in exploring how these ideas could be used in web3 spaces.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: A virtue I've realized is truly important is one of partnership. To me, partnership means valuing openness, listening, and accountability in our relationships. I think long-term partnerships, even through challenges, can build much-needed trust in our communities. I think this perspective is something I could bring and explore within the Dream DAO.
