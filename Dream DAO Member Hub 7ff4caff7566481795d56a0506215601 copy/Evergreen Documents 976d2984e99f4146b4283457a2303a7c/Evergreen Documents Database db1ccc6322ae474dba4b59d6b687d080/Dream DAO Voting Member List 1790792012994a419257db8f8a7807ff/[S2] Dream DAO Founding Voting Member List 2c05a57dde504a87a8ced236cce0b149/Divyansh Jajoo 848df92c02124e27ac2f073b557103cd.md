# Divyansh Jajoo

About me: I'm Divyansh and I'm currently a rising senior from Indore, India.
I love debating philosophy and engaging in activism ( it gets me going p:)!
After multiple experiences in volunteering, leadership projects, and internships, I'm currently launching "the civic project", a project that works on the intersection of diplomacy and actual social impact. You can check out a brief overview of the project here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WQwwuSCpczc-yWH-Y97GWuLN0FcUmKML_8K3AA-0DxE/edit
I also love creating content on social media - with 2m+ views on my page!
Having been raised by 2 amazing financially independent sisters, I've come to nurture and appreciate feminist values. It's also the reason I've had countless debates on "causal sexism" in schools, workplaces, and the internet. I'm also vocal about proper education for everyone, which I feel is one of the pillar-stones in tackling poverty.

Can help how?: As someone very interested in learning about web3, I feel this would be a great start. I'm super excited to learn and contribute to the project in any way I can utilize my skills. Through the resources and opportunities, I aim to refine my skills in various areas like developing campaigns, social media marketing, outreach, business/product development, etc. With these skills and learning of technical knowhow of the world of web-3, I aim to work on projects where I can see DAO would help, take on internships and broaden my experience in the professional world as well as participate in offline events, which I feel would be a great way for networking with amazing people from the industry from whom I can further learn a lot! Overall, Iâ€™m super excited about the opportunities in Dream Dao and the concept as a whole.
