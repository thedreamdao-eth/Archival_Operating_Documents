# Ash Kranti Srivastava

About me: I'm a community organizer and learner based in Chicago, IL. Most of my work centers around empowering others, especially young folx, to find their voice and you-shaped hole in society. The organizations I've worked with include Kaiya, the Illinois Safe Schools Alliance, and United Northwest Side, all of which have taught me to work with differing age groups in professional and casual settings to develop leadership skills and passions. I want to explore how we can use web3 to put power in the hands of young people, further empowering them to find their voice and passions.

Who is one person you DO personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: I would love to get Shreya involved in the Dream DAO. Every time she gives feedback in a meeting, it is insightful and helps push projects forward. She works a lot in the coding space and has provided tons of helpful support to GenZers across the globe.
Who is one person you DON'T personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: I would love to get Julia Terpak involved in the Dream DAO. I follow her on Instagram and she's taught me to be more open-minded about many topics through her bite-sized, research-driven explainations.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: I've been paying attention to the Dream DAO since day one, and firmly believe in its ideals. I had the privilege of giving feedback in the whitepaper early on, and I'm exicted to continue building this project however I can.
