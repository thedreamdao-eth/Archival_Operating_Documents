# Kiran Topiwala

About me: I am an artist in the way I live my life. My background is in Industrial and Systems Engineering, but I currently am studying for a Masters in Development Practice at Emory University. At the moment, I am working for a grassroots-level sustainable development organization in the foothills of the Himalayas in India, but also have experience working at large international NGOs.
What I do, has to do with community mobilization, engagement, and empowerment in low-resource and marginalized communities. I strive to localize the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, and work laterally at the grassroots level to find convergence with and synergize collective efforts towards solving problems such as poverty, hunger, health and well-being, and more. I am also an artist. I use photography as my primary medium to communicate stories, and create art for change, but also use it as an educational tool to give unheard voices a way to communicate their stories.
