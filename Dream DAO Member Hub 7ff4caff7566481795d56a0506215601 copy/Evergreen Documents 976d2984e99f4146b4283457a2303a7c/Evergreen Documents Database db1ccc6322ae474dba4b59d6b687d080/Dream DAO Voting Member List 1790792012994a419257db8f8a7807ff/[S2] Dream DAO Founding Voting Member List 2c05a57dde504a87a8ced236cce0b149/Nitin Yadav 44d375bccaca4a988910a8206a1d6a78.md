Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: My father was a farmer, and I saw him working hard on our farms, and suddenly due to whether the crops get affected, or the middle-man doesn't gave a good price for the crop produce. so, due to these reasons, I decided to find solutions to these problems in 2020, in this time I get to know about many new technologies (one of them is blockchain), and I found blockchain a promising one so started to get deep in this.

Can help how?: I can make the best use of these resources with the help of the supported community of creative thinkers and problem-solvers who are other Builders, try to make good collaborations with them, and with these resources, we together can build a platform for farmers which I talk about above.
