# Nathan Yan

About me: I've been an options trader for almost the entirety of my post grad working life, now currently self employed as of late 2020. My work and past experiences don't really have much direct correlation to web3 and youth empowerment, but I will say that in my line of work, mastering emotional control has been a key to success. I think in an objective manner. I believe in honesty, meritocracy, and really just hate bullshit. In a field with so many hot buzzwords like crypto, DAO, web 3.0 etc, it'll be easy for many, especially younger kids, to get caught up in the greed and money grab opportunities. I can provide a level headed voice of reason to help bring these kids back down to earth, to refocus on the bigger picture. I'll make it my mantra to make sure my influence on this DAO makes it as fair as possible for everyone involved.

Can help how?: Funding, Mentorship
# contributions: 1
Other comments: I only work around 35-40 hours a week and have pretty much all my weekends free. I can also provide some funding (up to 10k) if need be if it seems appropriate. I'm not really looking for any financial/monetary gain opportunities here, just looking to get more involved in the web 3.0 space, and I trust that Gary isn't doing this for financial reasons either. Which seems pretty rare in the crypto space.
