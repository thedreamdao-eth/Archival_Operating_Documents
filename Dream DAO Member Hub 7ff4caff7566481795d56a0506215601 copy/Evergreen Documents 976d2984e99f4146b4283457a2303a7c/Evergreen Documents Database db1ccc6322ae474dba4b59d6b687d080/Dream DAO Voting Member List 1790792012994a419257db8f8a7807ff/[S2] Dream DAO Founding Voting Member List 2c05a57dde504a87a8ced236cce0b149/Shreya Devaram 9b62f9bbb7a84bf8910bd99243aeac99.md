# Shreya Devaram

About me: My name is Shreya Devaram and I'm a junior at Guilderland High School. I'm a leader in my community through my involvement as PTSA Representative for Student Government, Secretary of UNICEF club, Treasurer of Speech and Debate club, and Campus Workshop Facilitator for Kode With Klossy. Most importantly, I'm a sister, daughter, and friend. I'm a Spring 2021 fellow, Civics 2030 Builder, and a CU Guide. I have contributed to CU by becoming a CU Guide for the Fall 2021 Fellowship and Spring 2022 Fellowship where I will facilitate meetings with a group of fellows every week, by being a regular attendee of Steering Committee meetings to offer feedback/thoughts about XYZ, being active on Slack and Discord with both the fellows and builders, regularly attending events such as treks, democracy discourse, MSOM, spontaneous hangouts, and etc, participating in two opportunities for Unplugged Strategies, used to be a fundraising subcommittee member before it was dissolved, volunteered to help Dariel create fellowship certificates for the Spring 2021 Fellowship and volunteered to answer questions from fellows through a Run the World event, and I'm planning to run for the Steering Committee. I care about the flourishing of humanity by tackling important issues such as climate change, education, and civics. And because I care about the flourishing of humanity, I also deeply care about Civics Unplugged. It's the reason why I show up everyday to do whatever I can help the community thrive. I would like to explore the intersection of web3 and social impact because we're in an era that is similar to the the rise of the internet in the 1980s: If we don't learn how to utilize fundamentals of web3 to create social impact, we'll be going backwards as opposed to creating a better future for humanity. Web3 will people to create unique applications, personalize the internet according to their needs, change human collaboration, and provide more transparency. But the problem is that many people don't know about web3 and how it can be harnessed to create a better future for humanity. I would like to be a part of the web3 revolution and use what I learned to create a capstone project in the social impact space.
