# Marco

About me: I'm Marco (24M) an entrepeneur from Italy with a US based company with the goal of using web3 to power project that fight Climate Change. I'm working on Gitcoin on Solarpunk Nomads, Fund Solarpunk Artists and Impact NFT Academy and much more.
I'm also personally running an artistic project called ''Climate Change Countdown'' where I create and post an art to spread awareness about Climate Emergency every single day.
I am in love in education and when not at home I love teaching while travelling. I've teached english in Czech republic and Taiwan in the last years. I would love to find ways to teach on web3.
I'm also a fan of alpinism, hiking and wild camping and I have been a mountain guide in the past.
