Can help how?: To harness the power of web3 and understand and be a meaningful part of the web3 x social impact ecosystem, I look forward to being a part of the Learning Together sessions that are hosted twice a week.
I am a believer in Research and Innovation, and I know that Dream DAO is a perfect place for me to understand and delve into my interest in Research through the Dream DAO Explorers Program. It is an amazing opportunity that I will engage in to get hands-on experience and knowledge on how web3 is currently impacting communities and contribute to the web3 x social impact organizations and create Learning Artifacts.
The IRL community gatherings sound like an interesting way to interact and collaborate with fellow web3 enthusiasts. In-person gatherings are an interesting way for me to not only meet new people, but exchange diverse perspectives and learn more about different approaches on how we can create social impact.
I am a...: curious, opportunity-focused, and passionate student
