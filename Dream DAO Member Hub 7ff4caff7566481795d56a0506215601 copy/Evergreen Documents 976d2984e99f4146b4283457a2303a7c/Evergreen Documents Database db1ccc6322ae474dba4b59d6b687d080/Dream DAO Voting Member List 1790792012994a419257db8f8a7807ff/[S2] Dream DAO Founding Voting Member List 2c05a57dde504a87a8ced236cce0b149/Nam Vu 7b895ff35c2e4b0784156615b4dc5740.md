# Nam Vu

About me: I am a student of business administration at the University of Greenwich Vietnam. I live in an old apartment building in Ho Chi Minh city, which is a community that has not paid much attention to climate change. After experiencing the venture capital industry, I immediately realized the emergency of always creating innovation in climate technologies. I'm working on developing a blockchain hub in the university and establishing an investment DAO built up from a solid network of web2 communities on climate.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: Is it possible to launch a Dream DAO community for the area of Vietnam/ ASEAN and host gatherings?
What's your birthday?: September 1, 2002
Can help how?: After attending some events, my favourite session was Learning Together, led by Colton Orr and Kate Eldaly. I'd like to use the sessions to share, learn, and create a learning artefact about the relationship between web3 builders and climate change, as well as the opportunities for blockchain in Vietnam, which is a good test market for climate technology.
The Explorer Programs enable me to contribute to Dream DAO and collaborate with other web3 communities in climate change or deep tech funding, potentially allowing me to have more global relationships and a know-how mindset when it comes to launching, hiring, and operating the DAO.
If Dream Dao is a great fit for my passion, I would love to set up a community for Vietnam/ South East Asian Dream DAO Builders, and host gatherings with regen web3 fellows in the area.
