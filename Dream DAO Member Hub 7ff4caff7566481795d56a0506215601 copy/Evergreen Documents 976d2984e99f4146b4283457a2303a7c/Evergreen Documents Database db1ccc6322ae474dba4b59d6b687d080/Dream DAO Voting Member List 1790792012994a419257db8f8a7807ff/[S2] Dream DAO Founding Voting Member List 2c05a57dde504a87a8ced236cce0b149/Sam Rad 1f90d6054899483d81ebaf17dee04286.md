# Sam Rad

About me: Hello there! I am Sam Rad. I don't even know where to start with the story of how my journey intersected with this new way of thinking, living, and collarborating. It was probably long before I got into tech as an entrepeneur. I was always questioning about how we could do things differently, shape a different reality, manifest the future. My background was actually in theater (as a writer, performer, and director) where I created a NYC based theater company for senior citizens 65+ to participate in plays that addressed socially relevant issues. I expanded this to all demographics, and incorporated tech. During that time, I was finishing my undergrad degree in anthropology and wrote my thesis on the virtual world, Second Life. I came across digital assets, bitcoin, and the ideas of decentralization and my mind was blown. I ended up on a PhD track to research virtual economies (in 2011) but started a company and, well, 3 companies in blockchain/web 3/crypto and here I am today. I found that over the years, my super power has been educating about the WHY of web 3 because so many folks would dive deep into the what it is, how it works, without showing WHY we need it. I ended up joining Singularity University in 2017 for blockchain faculty, have continued my research and participation in DAOs, give keynotes around the world, and have written an introductory guide called Bitcoin Pizza: The No-Bullshit Guide to Blockchain. I'm now the CEO of a Web 3 Communication Platform called LOVE, which aims to decentralize and democratize personal communications (and take on the Facebook monopoly!). We believe communication platforms (and the internet) should be a public utility. My super power is being a storyteller and catalyzer. I can equal gravitas stand on a stage as a keynote speaker or behind the stage as a director and empower folks into action. (If I believe in and my values align with the cause). As I have reflected over the years, I've realized that this shift in my consciousness is something that will never change and I will work the rest of my life to advocate, educate, and empower folks to imagine new models of cooperative governance, value creation, and more.

Who is one person you DO personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: Christopher Schlaeffer, founder of my current company, board member at Amnesty International, previous Android founder -- he could be a great connector on the Champions side. As for Builders, our company has been recruiting exceptional folks in Gen Z through a variety of casting calls. As part of their auditions they have shared what impact they want to leave on this world, and I was brought to tears watching the thousands of submissions. Our winners could be folks that could be incredible builders if given the infrastructure and support.
Who is one person you DON'T personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: I would have to think on this and how it would strategically align. Of course I would immediately say Greta Thunberg or other activists that work for the betterment of society, but let me think on it.

Other comments: Curriculum development, technical / product design (I'm also an engineer ex CPO, CTO, etc.) so I love to dig into making the Web 3 tooling easier for folks to understand (so we can onboard more!). I'm also working with some friends and family members on a new DAO concept to create the largest ever collective march in human history and well, who knows, maybe we can do this as a Dream DAO thing!!
