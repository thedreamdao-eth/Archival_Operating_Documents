# Kunal Baldava

About me: I'm a 16 year old high school senior from Mumbai, India who wants to understand society in a data-driven manner and have a significant positive impact on the world. To these ends, I plan to study economics and how it can be bolstered by the use of technology. Throughout my high school years, and especially during the pandemic, I've explored various fields by participating in competitions, conducting research, talking to people and just generally being curious to learn about new things. Currently most of my time outside of studies is dedicated to helping organize one of the largest student run conferences in the world(https://hpair.org/)(We are also planning to have a panel on Web3!). In 2020, I was part of an entrepreneurship bootcamp by TiE(the world's largest non-profit in the entrepreneurship space), post which I collaborated with 5 other students to build an ed-tech and peer-to-peer learning startup called Notefynd. Through this experience I learnt a lot more about what it takes to build a startup, got to interact and learn from various people in the ecosystem(angel investors, a VC, incubators, etc.) and also furthered my interest in education reform. This spring, I joined the International Socioeconomic Laboratory as a research fellow and, with 6 other team members, conducted a study on disparities in access to high quality parks in New York City.
I'm also attending a bootcamp on Effective Altruism and forming my own views about how to contribute to the world positively. I think that having access to the right education can change your life and hence I really care about reforming the education sector and providing students with more relevant and practical knowledge. As detailed in the next answer, I also love to learn about the happenings in the Web3 space.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: I learnt a lot in the two (and a half) Learning Togethers I've attended and even if I'm not selected as a builder I'd love to keep attending these sessions and learning more. As a CU Fellowship alum who has been on the Dream DAO discord server for a while, I'm really hoping to contribute to the community in a greater capacity and make full use of this opportunity if it is provided to me.

Can help how?: The primary reason I want to join the Dream DAO is the community of amazing, motivated people who are always ready to help you understand anything related to Web3 and share opportunities to learn more. Apart from engaging with the community, I will attend as many Learning Togethers as I can and be actively involved in the sessions by asking questions and sharing my thoughts. I also hope to be a part of the explorers program and implement my learnings in a real world environment to have a positive impact. Finally, if I get the opportunity, I will attend IRL Web3 events in my region and also host Gatherings to learn more from the larger Web3 community and spread the word about Dream DAO.
