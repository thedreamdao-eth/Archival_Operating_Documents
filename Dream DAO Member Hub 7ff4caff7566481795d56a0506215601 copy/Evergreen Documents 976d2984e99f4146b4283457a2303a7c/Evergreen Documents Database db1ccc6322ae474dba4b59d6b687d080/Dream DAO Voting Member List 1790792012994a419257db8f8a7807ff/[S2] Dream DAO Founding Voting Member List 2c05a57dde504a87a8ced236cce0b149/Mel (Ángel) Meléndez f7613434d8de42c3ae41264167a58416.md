About me: I'm a web developer and I work as an IT consultant for cloud solutions. I've been involved in ethereum since 2017 and have been discovering projects and uses for the technology. After DeFi summer, I started to get more into web3. After learning how to develop in web3, I've been ideating how the technology can be used for community strengthening. I've learned about some DAOs and people who are involved in it. After ETHMexico Hackathon, I got a better insight of the community, the connections and the potential. I partnered with some of the DreamDAO members and learned about the DAO. I definitely want to help the society newcomers (youth) to embrace the technology and help them to solve problems today, for tomorrow.
