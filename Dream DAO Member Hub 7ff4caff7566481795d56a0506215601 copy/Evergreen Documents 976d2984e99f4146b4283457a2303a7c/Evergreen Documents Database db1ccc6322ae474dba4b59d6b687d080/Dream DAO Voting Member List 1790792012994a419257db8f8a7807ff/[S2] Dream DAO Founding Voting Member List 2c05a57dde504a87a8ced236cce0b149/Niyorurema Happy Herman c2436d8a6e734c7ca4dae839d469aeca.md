# Niyorurema Happy Herman

About me: My name is Happy Herman Niyorurema, a grade 11 Law and Political Science aspirant of change for a better society. With that in mind, I founded Street Bridge Foundation, a youth-led initiative mandated to voice for the voiceless, but most especially the invisible society e.g Street kids and child mothers in countries south of the Sahara.
Although it's a small benevolent campaign, it really means a lot in my life since it has not only changed the lives of more than 18 street kids in Rwanda but also defined the very essence and ability of youth in social impact.
Additionally to benevolence, I am also a passionate debater and orator on my country’s debate national team.

Can help how?: “Seldom is indeed, the new lives are born from the pairs of the old” one poet said. With the team of fellow builders, mentors and friends at Dream Dao, I hope to germinate and discover more about how ABCD (Asset-Based Community Development) approach can spearhead social impact in my country. I look forward to selflessly contributing to my society by building and collaborating on decentralised projects that enhance efficiency, user ownership and privacy.
Additionally, I also hope to connect with a plethora of disciplines from al corners of the globe with whom I will connect for a common cause. (United we stand)
If possible, I also look forward to starting a Dream DAO club/community at my school where I will train fellow students on what Web 3.0 means in the world of today.
