Can help how?: I would utilise the Learning together sessions to expand on my knowledge of Web3 and be made aware of its potentials so that we as a community can work together towards reaching that potential.
As someone who has a variety of interests, I would love to be a versatile figure and in order to do that, I would need to have a network of people to learn from so therefore, I would take advantage of the IRL Regen Web3 gatherings to build up a network of people and maybe be able to work on projects together irl that fuels my passions. I would also be able to learn from people who have more experience in the Web3 world and be able to get involved with like-minded individuals on a personal level.
