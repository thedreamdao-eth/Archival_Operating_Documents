# Archi Kanugo

About me: Hi! My name is Archi. I love exploring my own passions to view the world through a tangible lens. The young me has always been passionate about doing something new. Making art is one of my favorite things in the world. I've been doing it for quite a long time. I care about the things I want to pursue and which keeps me going from civic innovation to quantum computing. Diving more into the sciences makes me more aware of things that already exist and the path which will finally lead to new innovations.
