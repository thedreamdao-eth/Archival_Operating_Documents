# Yubahwe Tresor

About me: I am an 18 year old student from Rwanda who deeply cares about Gender Equity and access to education. I like hanging out with new people, new friends. Like I am not too social but I like listening to others and knowing if they are okay, listening to their problems to help them feel relieved. I also like reading the history of successful people, their backgrounds and how their life path was like mostly through reading their biographies. I care a lot about women's rights. After recognizing how some people are experiencing hard times and sometimes miss some opportunities that they deserve just because they are girls, I wish I can offer my contribution through helping those who are taken as unable, invisible and less valued maybe through their advocacy or operating an organisation that supports them!

Can help how?: I wish to expand on my skills as a writer and thus wish to be involved in Documentation needs in the Governance working group and grant writing in the partnerships working group, as they would help me best expand and learn about the same.
Getting the opportunity to learn through various learning togethers and solarpunk discussions can inspire me to come up with novel narratives and historical revivals of ecological harmony in Rwandan history and culture.
Utilising the benefits of the explorers programme to apply my learning and work at the DAO for writing and public speaking, or get a chance to work around creating narratives for Web3 x Afrofeminism!
Getting a chance to travel and speak across the world through the gatherings opportunity can deeply bless me with realising my potential to speak for myself, the communities and the friends I care for.
