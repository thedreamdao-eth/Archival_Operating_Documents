# Adarsh Choudhary

About me: I am a 1st-year college student from India pursuing a B.S. degree in Sustainability & Analytics Studies at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences. I am interested and have been constantly involved in the area of social impact, especially quality education and have been involved in developing different projects and working with organisations like Teach for India.
I am passionate about working for the social impact and sustainable development goals of the UN with the integration of web3, technology and regenerative finance. I define myself as an explorer who is open to new learnings and tread in challenging environments.
