# Reid Starzl

About me: My name is Reid Starzl. I care about a lot of things, but I would say I care especially for the state of the current world. The ecosystem on our planet is changing rapidly, and I care deeply about guiding that change in a good direction. Social impact, as this form puts it, is another subject that holds my passion, and I am equally passionate about making a difference that way. On my own time, I compete for my school district on the speech team in the category of discussion, which involves staking a plan as a group to change an issue that we are presented with. Our robotics team is another thing I care strongly about, as I am absolutely fascinated by electronics and their workings, and I am the lead Java programmer for that team.

Nearest major city: Minneapolis
Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: The thought of being involved in the Web3 space is very daunting, so an opportunity to learn about what it is and what it does is super enticing. I would appreciate the opportunity to be involved in such a thing, and appreciate what is being offered by the DAO.
Fellowship cohort: Fall 2021
What's your birthday?: January 17, 2006
Can help how?: The Learning Together sessions, of which I have only attended two, already seem like a great way to become more educated about things such as real-life applications for solarpunk views and ideas. They also provide a good way to talk with peers about the ideas brought up in the DAO that are hard to find locally.
The Explorers Program offers a way for people like me to actually have a direct involvement in the Web3 space aside from discussion. I would really look into what I can contribute with. Additionally, I have a strong interest in cybersecurity, which I plan to work with professionally, and programming. While I know these skills are not necessarily needed, I am passionate about them and would appreciate any way to be involved regarding them.
The IRL Collaborations are very exciting to even think about. I live in a fairly rural area, so the possibility to talk with people in real life about these digital Web3 ideas is enticing. Additionally, traveling to a place like New York to meet with likeminded and diverse people sounds like it would be an unforgettable experience and help myself be involved deeply.
