# Roman Messali

About me: Living in the political epicenter of the United States, I have a lot of interest in policy and government. I participate in many policy-driven advocacy groups like Generation Ratify to change build a fairer democracy and civil society for all. Yet, I believe that we are living in an age where individuals, organizations, and companies are moving at a much greater pace than government is. In large part, this is due to the rapid technological innovation we've experienced in the last 20 years. While citizens are able to create cross-national digital advocacy groups, governments are barely able to create functioning websites. Through web3 technologies, I hope that we could create a better democracy; that we could build greater government transparency, faciliate organizing, and speed things up.

Who is one person you DO personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: While this may be a tough sale, I would like to invite my AP Comparative Government teacher, who is relatively young and has always made it a point to support youth leadership and projects. He has also talked about his regrets of not investing in cryptocurrencies when first introduced in the early 2010s, so I wonder if this could be an opportunity for him to fulfill both. 
Who is one person you DON'T personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: I'm going to assume he's already applied, but if not, I see the most potential in Madhav Goyal, a recent builder from the Fall 2021 Fellowship. Not only has he explained many of the fundamental web3 concepts to me in incredible clarity, but he's currently running an incredible blog on upcoming technologies, especially web3 ones. I see immense potential in him; I truly believe he can create the next big thing!
