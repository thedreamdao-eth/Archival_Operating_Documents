Can help how?: I will make the best use of the provided resources by exploring my fields of interest and their connections with web3. I would also like to learn about regen web3 as I am sensitive to climatic changes around the world and the current cryptocurrency practices might not be the most energy efficient. I feel that we can pitch ideas about cryptocurrency and web3 only when we have a utopian vision in which these ideas do not take from the nature and actually give back (and also work towards achieving that utopian vision).
I especially liked the learning together session and would like to attend more of them!
