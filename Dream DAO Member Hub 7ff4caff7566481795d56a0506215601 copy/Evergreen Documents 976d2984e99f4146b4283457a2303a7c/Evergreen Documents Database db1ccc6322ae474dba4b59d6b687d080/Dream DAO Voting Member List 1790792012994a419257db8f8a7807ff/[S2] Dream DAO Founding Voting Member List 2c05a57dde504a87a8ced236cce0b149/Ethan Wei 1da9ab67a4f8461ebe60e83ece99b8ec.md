# Ethan Wei

About me: I am a new web3 enthusiast with a background in business strategy, product management, and effective altruism. I've always been looking to impact as many people as possible, and want to take an active role (both as a participant and builder) in the cultivation of Gen Z talent. Having recently learned about cause areas and impact metrics in effective altruism, I want to take those learnings and apply them to my new interest in web3. Thus, I think DreamDAO with its social impact emphasis meshes well with my aspirations.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: I think my background helps me a lot in the ideation/execution phase. I work well with metrics, timelines, and KPIs/OKRs and it should help with early-stage organization as a DAO. Hopefully, I can put it to use even when (and if) I become a builder in terms of organizing teams on initiatives, suggesting action items for others' ideas, and setting goals for the group.
