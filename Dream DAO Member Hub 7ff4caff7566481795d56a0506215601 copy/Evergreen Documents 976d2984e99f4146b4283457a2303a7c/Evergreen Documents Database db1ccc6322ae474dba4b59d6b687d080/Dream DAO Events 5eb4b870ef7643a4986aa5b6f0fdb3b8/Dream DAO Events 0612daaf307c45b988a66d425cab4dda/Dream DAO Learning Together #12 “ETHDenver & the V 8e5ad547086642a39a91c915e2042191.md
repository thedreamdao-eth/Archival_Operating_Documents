## Kickoff (10 mins)

Impressions from Gary:  There was an amazing regenerative finance meet-up on the first day that brought together multiple DAOs and groups.  It was held in a collective space (with solarpunk vibes).  Denver is a really cool city with lots of art.  The longest-running Ethereum conference is in Denver, which makes sense because Denver is technologically advanced while still grounded.  There are a lot of people on a post-conference ski trip to reconnect with nature.  Thursday had a Gitcoin event.  People thinking about design - even people initially critical - were there.

Thessy:  There are different types of events from ETHDenver, but ETHDenver is really community-oriented.  It has a specific focus on collaboration and open world views.  This is separate from the environment of, say, Bitcoin events.  NFT-only communities occasionally lose their message because they don‚Äôt bring people in and instead keep people out (exclusive can mean unattainable).  At the conference, I went to an event focusing on web3 and inclusion and the interaction of those ideas with a governance structure.

- Gary:  I felt a real desire to make social impact.  Other conferences missed this value.
    - Thessy: Lots of NGO and UN people at conferences.
        - Gary: It‚Äôs very important to have people intersect in different areas.

Gary:  In the first few days of the conference, there was a hackathon.  Each day had a ton of talks and side events.  I met with a lot of people in-person and went to curated side events.  I spent a lot of time with groups I wanted to get closer to, including the Coinbase team.  I want SkywalkerZ to be listed on their platform at the next launch.  It‚Äôs a valuable experience to get to meet and understand a person‚Äôs energy face-to-face.

## Provocation/Question: Would someone without experience abroad or at conferences be welcome?

- Gary:  Especially at web3 conferences, things can work out.
- Kevin:  The preparation is super important.  Go with intention, and things can work out.
    - Gary:  Preliminary work is crucial, especially for young people.  You can get the best of both worlds if you have a plan but give yourself permission to deviate.
- Saf:  Understand that there will be culture shock and that things will feel very different.

## Provocation/Question: Were the ‚Äúside events‚Äù you referenced invitation-based or open to everyone?

- Gary:  A lot of them require invitations - friends being invited to private events, etc.  If you don‚Äôt already have a lot of connections at the conference, there needs to be a lot more intention ahead of time.  Networks may have to be facilitated.  It‚Äôs important to properly document what makes a conference attendee successful to help others succeed.
- Chabu:  A unique concern - if you meet someone at a conference, you need to make sure you are being safe while being taken seriously.  Being young and identifying as a woman means that you have to be cognizant of your surroundings.
    - Saf:  Demographics will be barriers to inclusion or feelings of comfort.  We would need to be very intentional.
- Gary:  The chance of a minor attending is very low unless there is an explicit chaperone.
- Thessy:  It would be great to have more Builders engaged with Women in Blockchain - side events such as these are important.

## Provocation/Question: Do Builders have experiences at conferences?

- Chabu:  I have some experiences at conferences.  They used to be the most energizing moments ever; as I got older, I realized they were somewhat useless.  The same conversations were happening over and over.  That being said, my frame of reference comes from the AU and UN conferences, so others may be different.
- Kevin:  If there was a collaborative project that everyone was working on at each event, that might help make the conference more valuable.  (As opposed to getting together for the same intention over and over.)
    - Goals across conferences.
- Chabu:  One approach I have is going with a pre-set agenda.  Networking is usually the primary result from that.  Who do I want to meet?  Do I meet them?  I can put myself out there and have a ‚Äúpitch‚Äù already put together.

## Provocation/Question: What comes next?

- Gary:  I‚Äôll leave this open.  If someone has a compelling reason to attend a conference, create a proposal.  We should create side events at conferences as a DAO.  The creation of a temporary working group for this purpose might be helpful; if interested, let‚Äôs post the idea in one of our Discord channels!  We can create a thread in the take-on-quests channel.

## Provocation/Question: How do you keep the energy after a conference and maintain your connections?

- Gary:  ETHDenver was an energetic space unlike any other event I‚Äôve been to.  We should bring more Builders and Champions to the conferences in general.

## Provocation/Question: Plans for social impact conferences?

- Gary:  Civics Unplugged is hoping to hold a summer conference.  Web3 x social impact or civic innovation could be the theme of the conference.
- Thessy:  Could be held in October before DEFCON.
- Gary:  We could hijack another conference and bring social impact to the space.
    - Thessy:  Everything has impact - it needs to be good social impact.

## Provocation/Question: Did ETHDenver partner with any nonprofits or other groups?

- Gary:  The conference‚Äôs biggest partner was Gitcoin.  Almost all of Thursday was devoted to the group.

## Provocation/Question: What were some of the most exciting people that you met?

- Gary:  There are a lot of people that I met that would be amazing for Learning Together sessions.  Some attendees - only a little bit older than the Builders - would be great.
    - I met one of the leading civilizational design experts in the world.  He was impressed with the goals and experiences of Civics Unplugged.  It‚Äôs easy to forget that this community doesn‚Äôt happen everywhere.  We don‚Äôt get caught up in any sort of culture war as well.
    - I want to create public goods superheroes to show the world the power of committed people.  We are in a make-or-break decade, with issues intersecting and escalating.  We need to think, gather, and work together.
- Thessy:  I mentioned the Dream DAO multiple times at ETHDenver - loved to share about it.

## Reflections and Takeaways (10 mins)

*What is one thing you learned from this conversation? What new questions did you develop during this session?*

- Saf:  It was great to see and hear about the value of in-person events.  There are real people behind the screens of web3.
- Kevin:  It was amazing to have this discussion.  This event made it easy to understand and comprehend what was happening.  Chats like these would be great in the CU or Dream DAO community when big things happen.
- Gary:  I learned a lot about making the most of conferences.  ETHDenver was mainly ‚Äúfree‚Äù but it cost money.  It‚Äôs important to have guidance and intention.
- Thessy:  Use SkywalkerZ to pay for conferences?
    - Gary:  Floor price is incredibly high right now.
    - Saf:  Would minting ever be a consideration for fundraising?
    - Gary:  Not a bad idea...
    - Kevin:  Similar to ear-marking donations, etc.  We could create generations.
    - Saf:  Another solution is to not do SkywalkerZ but another type of collection.
        - Gary:  Hesitant to over-complicate ideas.
- Ahyun: This session was really interesting! It was a little different from other ones, but I think that‚Äôs what made it all the more compelling! Conferences and events are great opportunities to interact with other people around the world and collaborate on projects, but it‚Äôs crucial to build a common vision or agenda, as well as consider how we can make them a seed for new ideas to grow. I personally have only been to Model UN conferences, but I see the common importance of adopting an effective systems approach and continuing the momentum beyond the conference. Lovely meeting everyone!

*What can we do better next time? How can we improve our next Dream DAO Explorer session?*
