## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by <Rashmika Vinakota>

- “Why web3 hiring is unique?” - web3 has a lot of unknown factors. web3 is viewed as “old-school”, no singular direction. It’s important to be open with the path you take. It’s perfect for people still deciding on their careers. Autonomy. token allocation + traditional compensation.
- Talent transparency is unique in web3 | Tons of visibility | Non-developer crypto talents (non-technical), building a whole new role and opening up a lot more opportunities for people from all fields
- One of the qualifications recruiters look for is “self-starter”. A disadvantage to DAOs is not having proper onboarding plans to help technical and non-technical participants understand web3, the mission and vision of the DAO, etc. **Self-management** is important.
- Finding a role is not as traditional/predictable as it used to be. For example, being active in communities, on Twitter, and going to in-person events, (palette?).
- Venture capitals are funding projects, leads to the creation of job opportunities. **“What is your portfolio hiring for right now?”.**
- Attending In-person events is where you connect with people

## Provocation/Question: Effective altruism and its intersection with web3

- Effective altruism is a moment started by a philosophy professor from oxford a decade ago and explores how we can use empirical methods and data to determine how the best areas to work on. Supported by Sam Bankman(?)
- Often misunderstood, figuring out how to benefit others to the best of your ability. web3 is naturally about doing good owing to it’s decentralised nature. Web3 is about community and doing good. Web2 is needed but also isn’t anything web3 has to offer.
- There is a lot of opportunity for it to get intertwined with web3

## Provocation/Question: Fun question - If not a recruiter, then what?

- Strategy and operations, building strategy processes for organisations. Having influence and making impact.
- Whether you’re in the beginning of your career, or the middle ask yourself “what are your core missions”. Be true to your core values.
- Arman - The way strategy works in onboarding, system is important. Enforces strategy building.

## Provocation/Question: Do you think different structures is because of the new market or the community?

- **Culture**
- Web3 is naturally decentralised, hence non-traditional. Community and culture is natural.

## Provocation/Question: In traditional large organisations it is difficult to prioritise teams,

<aside>
💡 Book Rec - Reinventing Organisations

</aside>

Understanding the organisational structure of a big company, resources for teams, how they will be supported. 

The hierarchy structure is different in web3 organisations as opposed to traditional companies. 

One thing all web3 companies have in common is their desire to be connected and have transparency, however becomes difficult to maintain transparency. Some people do need that kind of structure. Based on personal preferences. Understand personal needs

## Provocation/Question: Why is "team" given so much importance in startups but an afterthought as you mentioned in big organizations?

- Things get lost in big organisations. With start-ups, decisions are initially collective and systematic. As the company gets bigger, visibility decreases as it becomes an afterthought.

## Provocation/Question: How will web3 intersect with different forms of arts?

- NFTs - Non-Fungible Tokens
- Widens job opportunities for artists

## Provocation/Question: Recruiting is essential but might become more of a factory situation - Arman

- If an organisation is not planning properly
- Recruiting tends to be an afterthought for most organisations but talent is essential to building it.
- wThere are layoffs, redundancies, as people elect to wait to observe the market but you get at a point where you’re behind and are in competition with other talents. Anxious, impulsive for want of security.
- Interest and passion are VERY important when choosing a career, especially in web3. It changes your perspective on life and your job.
- The state of the economy, how things are going on in the world.

💡 Book Recommendation - How to Move My Cheese by Spencer Johnson

</aside>

## Provocation/Question: I'm curious to see how web 3 intersects with STEM fields esp. Physics maybe space science too? Could you shed some light on it? - Ibtesam

- Intersection of regenerative science with web3, we’re not seeing it yet. There is something new in web3 every single day.
- Set up a google alert / research (consistency of research)

## Provocation/Question: Do you think that once web3 becomes more mainstream, we will see the same factory situation repeating in this space?(just due to the sheer scale at which organizations will have to recruit)

- There need to be dedicated people, leadership that bring on talent that will utilise web3 in the right way.

## Provocation/Question: if there's public policy oriented roles in this space too? and if yes, how does that look like? both in corporate and social impact spheres? - Gauri

- Public policy is a big area in public sector
- Government relations, lobbyists, CBDC partnership roles. Will depend on the mission of the organisation
- Roles that are/will be hiring/hired

## Provocation/Question: Could you speak about the different types of roles in a typical web3 organization(both technical and non-technical)?

- Non-developer crypto talent can be the hardest position. Understanding work design in the organisation’s mission.
- Technical - Web services, core engineering team, blockchain engineers, payments team, the product team
- Non-technical - HR, operations, design, marketing, communications, finance, legal
- Depends on the needs of the organisation and where they are (established, founding, etc)

## Provocation/Question: I face problems in find jobs for my age which is I can't work if I am under 18 years old. Could you help to know some organizations to work, please? What do you recommend me?

- Difficult to find work as a minor, based on school schedule. Paid internship are allowed. Also depends on employment policies in respective countries. Explore what kind of options you have.

## Provocation/Question: Non-traditional recruitment - Arman

- “What the person offers us rather than the other way around”. It’s the essence of community, and engages trust within members of a community.

## Provocation/Question: How do benefits work in web3? - Ash Kranti

- A lot of web3 companies do provide benefits. If you take talent from web2 - necessary. Web3 companies mirror start-ups. Employees are offered health, dental, etc. Long-term employment depends on the location of the employee and of the entity (you can negotiate higher salary). If you are brought on as a contractor, you will be paid a premium. Understand the role before you commit.

## Provocation/Question: I face problems in understanding token negotiation, can you share your experience about your journey understanding it? - Arman

- Minimal experience with crypto/blockchain (non-technical). Building trust with your partner / asking questions / curiosity / reaching out to the community. The more you know, the better you can navigate it.

## Provocation/Question: As a recruiter, how do you convince the best talent to join the web3 space over traditional companies, especially in a market like this when trust in web3 isn't very high? - Kunal

- Recruiting is fundamentally broken as it became something of a transaction. What motivates you, and what are you interested in. Sharing information with talent so they understand the mission and vision so that they WANT to join the company. (motivating factors - finance, philanthropy, security, etc). People who join web3 need to WANT to join.

## Reflections and Takeaways (10 mins)

*What is one thing you learned from this lecture + conversation? What new questions did you develop during this session?*

*What can we do better next time? How can we improve our next session?* 

Ash Kranti - Thank you for coming! Young people are often undervalued even in web2. It’s really insightful and I appreciate the support
