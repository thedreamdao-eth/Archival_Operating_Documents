- Camila wanted to experience more about what LatAm can offer to the world.
- One of the things that Camila wondered was what Latinoamerica could offer (natural resources, people, knowledge) to the world.
- There are some aspects in Latinoamerica that makes it great in terms of web3, that is legislation.
- Panama, as part of some countries nowadays, is taking discussion using crypto,
- The cryptocurrency of Latinoamerica is growing up more and more with the passing of the year.
- Other aspects increasing the relations from Latinoamerica with web3 and blockchain are the events happening there, Devcon Bogota, and Et[hereum.Rio](http://Thereum.Rio) in Brazil and Labitconf in El Salvador.
- With crypto you can save, you can pay, you can earn.
- During the pandemic, using Celo crypto, Ecuareceivedeive humanitarian aid kits.
- In Celo, there is a community that manages events related to ecosystems and climate change, and sustainability on social media (lives, messaging channels,).

## Provocation/Question: Why in Brazil there is a huge community dedicated to nature and sustainability projects?

- There are different reasons, one of them is that in Brazil there are many ecosystems and natural resources.
- In the political aspect, people are conflicted about what is happening with climate change in the world.
- Another reason is that Brazilians are so creative, they have many relevant social movements in for sustainability.

## Provocation/Question: How do the events from Latinoamerica are different in content from the USA or Europe?

- One aspect that is different is the vibe of the events.
- Other aspects that are different from the events of Latinoamerica and Europe are the feelings and the onboarding objectives in each one.
- The size of the events also changes depending on the country, and one thing that varies depending on the country is the language that people use.
