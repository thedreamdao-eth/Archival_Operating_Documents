### Open Design Questions

In the communities you're in - how do you describe the members that are the most valuable? 

- Initial Thoughts
    
    @Chabu Kapumba: People who embrace self-reflection, recognizing patterns and processes, systems thinking approach, jamming, feedback, etc. These are usually seen as 'soft skills' but are actually key when broaching uncharted territory. I will add that it's hard to prove/test for these skills but that doesn't mean we shouldn't actively look for these qualities
    
    @Gary Sheng: What does this look like for both Champions and Builders? Reading documents. giving thoughtful feedback, making warm introductions, and really thinking through their network 
    
- Thanasi: Community members who know how to contribute their key skills effectively
- Tyler: The most passionate members contribute the most
- Madison: "People who can curate culture"
- Chabu: Community members who can support you inside and outside the community
- Roman: Finding the balance between support and taking a step back
- Jae-Hee: "Individuals who evoke a new dimension of you"
- Jae-Hee: People who are comfortable being uncomfortable
- Jacob: People who keep you connected to the team
- Chauncey: Autonomy, mastery, and purpose (values of motivation)
- Luna: Investing in community building and getting to know people outside of the DAO space, being seen as a whole person
- Luna: Welcoming feedback and fostering discourse
- Luna: People who celebrate contributions
    - Tyler: Can we build that into government?
    - Roman: Can we tie this into merit badges?
    - Gary: "Community choice merit badges"
- Josh: Community members that challenge and push the team
- Gary: People willing to do things that aren't cool or interesting

What communities can we be introduced to where we can meet potential Champions that can ensure that the Champion community has the diversity it needs to be as valuable as it can to the Builder community?  

- Initial Thoughts
    
    @Jae-Hee Bae: One interesting or "unique" idea would be to sync with a potential mentor figure. But instead of an interview, the applicant goes through a friendly hypothetical problem-solving simulation in real-time. Plans are fragile but persistence / problem-solving skills are enduring. By observing how they approach problems and pose solutions, we can get a feel of what kind of thinkers they are. This can also be a great learning opportunity for both parties.
    
    - @Gary Sheng: Merit badges!
- Tyler: We can use the silicon valley as a case study for ways to address the challenge
- Josh: CU has a strong foundation and is pulling from the community
- Chauncey: Reduced identity barriers because everything happens online
- Thanasi: How can we use language that welcomes people who are curious?
- Roman: Tech and finance attracts a specific crowd. It's important to craft a narrative that attracts a diverse group
    - Gary: Leverage case studies to prove it
- Jae-Hee: Include people who are hesitant in the design process and allow them to act as advocates
- Tyler: Explaining the potential of this base concept and how else it can create impact
- Chabu: Narrative and framing is key
    - What other narratives can we create and cultivate?
- Roman: What people of influence can help draw in skeptics?
- Jacob: Diverse perspectives have different questions, priorities, and concerns (e.g. adults asking if this is still tax deductible)
    - Do we want that connotation so early on?
- Tyler: What is the overlap between this space and gov/politics?
- Josh: Important to focus on people who are naturally excited about this space
    - Thanasi: We should be open to bridging the gap

## Key Design Choices + Experiments

---

- Gary: Let's create content that features speakers that have different personal stories to resonate with diverse audiences
    - Jae-Hee: What other languages can we use? (and cc)
- Thanasi: What will the first vote be?
    - Tyler: No special voting for first NFT members
    - Gary: Not every badge can be leveraged for voting
- Chabu: What community building experiments can we run in the discord?
- Roman: Focus on what this tech can do in the future while describing the power of the DAO (narrative)
- Jae-Hee: How can we make sure the tech stack isn't a barrier to understanding/getting onboarded in the space?
- Gary: We need a what's new equivalent for the DAO
