Notes by <Fernando Cruz>

- Jody Weiss brings capital technology like blockchain.
- She was an executive director in 1980.
- She worked in the sports industry, related to athletes.
- Jody founded a company that was destroyed in 1990 by hurricane Sandy.
- She¬¥s been many years involved in the business environment.
- As part of the LT, Jady asked everyone in the session to describe on a peace of paper to themselves.
- After writing their ideas, Jody told them that what they wrote on their pieces of paper was a list of their personality and identity.
- As another activity, Jody practiced with everyone a meditation exercise in which everyone closed their eyes and just focussed on their minds. (5-10 minutes)
- In the second part of the activity, Jody asked to look at a specific object near everyone and she asked us to see them for 1 minute.
- After doing this activity, Jody explained that this practice was helpful and developed our intellect and she also added that this activity is super powerful because we deconstruct our minds in the process.
- After doing the activities, she told that she loves doing these because, for her, this practice demonstrates that our minds, our intellects, and our egos are tools for our lives.
- Also, she recommends using the meditation activity as part of our daily lives, she asked us to do this activity when we feel anxious, when we feel angry, and when we can not get concentrated.
- Finally, she closed her lecture by saying that she hope we can get inspired by these activities to experiment deeply with our minds

## Provocation/Question: What other exercise can help us with this?

- The principal objective of these activities is to inspire us to use more our minds.
- Another exercise that you can practice is to manage your thoughts, when thoughts come to our minds, our mind runs. Thoughts come in, like our energy and as our energy, we can manage our thoughts when we let them enter our body, and when we let them go, the thing is to practice with our minds trying to mange our thoughts, letting the enter to ur body nad letting the leaving it.

## Provocation/Question: What is the purpose of these activities?

- The purpose of doing these activities is to understand how our mind works, it is interesting the fact the connection that exists between the intellect and the brain and how they can help us to describe our identity and our actions in our daily lives.
