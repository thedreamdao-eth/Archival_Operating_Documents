## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Charlotte

- Antoni Gaud√≠ in Barcelona used solarpunk strategies and concepts (in design, gathering rain water, etc.).
- Broadacre City had great access to nature combined with technological advances.  F.L Wright has designed a number of amazing architectural pieces.
- In cities, there is a concept of keeping services and ideas close to the the citizens.
    - 15-minute Paris - necessities are available within fifteen minutes of travel.
    - Barcelona has a number of city centers within the entire city.
- We should try to reduce transit and shift into public transportation and bike infrastructure.
- In the 1960s in Copenhagen, a research group contrasted scientific studies with cars by studying human behavior in cities.  Where there was more social life, there were less cars.  Thus, a movement began to limit cars.
    - The same strategies were implemented in New York City and in Times Square.
- Self-sustainable cities are being developed in places like China.  The buildings will generate their own foods, reuse organic waste, have solar panels, etc.
- Although often overlooked, materials can be an important aspect of solarpunk building.
- There are unique innovations like 3D-printed earth construction, etc.  There are a lot of possibilities.

- Solarpunk means more than just ‚Äúgreen.‚Äù  Don‚Äôt be fooled by aesthetic - look beyond towards components like infrastructure, etc.
- Concrete is not a sustainable material - from its creation to the end of its use.  Other materials can be better to use.  We need to manage the forest with sustainable materials in order to prevent fires, for example.
- Our communities are becoming more isolated.  Families are spending less time interacting with other families.  This can be adjusted with housing options that share certain spaces (common kitchen, common laundry, etc.).  It‚Äôs a way to build a network.
- Ownership does not have to follow current models.  Cooperative management, etc.

- There are also learnings that we can take from co-ops and DAOS.
- As an individual, ask yourself about how you interact with a space.  Understand what makes you feel safe, comfortable, good, etc.

## Provocation/Question: How can old/existing buildings be retrofitted to become more solarpunk?

- One of the best strategies is to insulate buildings - they have to be energy efficient.  We can also change windows for this purpose.  After that, we should work on infrastructure.  Harvesting rain water, using solar panels, creating protections from the sun, etc.
- Thessy: Places are being retrofitted right now.
- Traditional architecture can give us the key to how we have to build right now.  Old + new.
