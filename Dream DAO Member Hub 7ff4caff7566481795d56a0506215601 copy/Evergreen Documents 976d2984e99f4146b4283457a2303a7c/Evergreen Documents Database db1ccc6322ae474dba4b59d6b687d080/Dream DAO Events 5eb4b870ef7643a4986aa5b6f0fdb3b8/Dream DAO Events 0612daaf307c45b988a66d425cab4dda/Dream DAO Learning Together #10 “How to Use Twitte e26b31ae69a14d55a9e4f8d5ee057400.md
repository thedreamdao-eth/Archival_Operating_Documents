## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Safder: 

Uses for Twitter (Matt):

- Education: Curating your feed
    - - eg; learning about Regenerative Finance and social goods
- Networking; unique to Twitter: when you reach out to someone or tag them in a thread, they are very likely to respond. Very collaborative vibes. Opportunities to engage in real conversations
- Leveraging Twitter for personal brand: have your own base, expend your own voice; supercharge your ability to connect with people and mission that you/your community is driving
- Staying up to date: Fast-moving space
- Different perspectives: people have many different ways of thinking about the varying topics in web3; important to gain all the perspectives so you can form your opinion and see the greater picture

Getting started (Tom): 

- Who to follow?
    - - Oliver has put together a list of Dreamers/Builders on Twitter
    - - Who you’re following is what you’re going to extract from Twitter
    - - Who you’re getting in your feed is extremely relevant to what you’re going to get out of the platform
    - - Follow journalists, web3 people
    - - If I see anyone who says something I like, I follow them
    - - Constantly curate your feed to figure out what’s best for you; follow/unfollow people
- Topics: Tweets sorted by “most recent” or general content - great mechanism for discovering new folks and getting a wide swathe of information on topics you’re interested in
    - - You can “follow” topics
- Spaces: NFTs spun out of “Clubhouse” sessions; Spaces is used for AMA sessions, when mints are happening as a mechanism for talking through onboarding, and having conversations with random people; observe real-time conversations between pioneers in the tech space; you can raise your hands and jump into the conversations
- Notifications: Timing is important in web3 - turn notifications on/off for people you are following

Allocate Time (Matt): 

- Set intention: Intentionality is key to unlocking the benefit of the platform; instead of unlocking your phone, going to Twitter, ask yourself why you’re going on Twitter
- Time blocking: Make sure to time-block certain things you want to accomplish throughout the day (set a time limit for Twitter)
- Reflections: At the end of your time on Twitter, spend 5 extra minutes to reflect on what you learned/what excited you etc. After you have those reflections, you can post them for the world to see to further grow your personal brand

The Ugly of Twitter (Prof): 

- Trolls: if you’re writing comments on Instagram, they get lost; however comments on Twitter are a lot more intentional; you may be getting poked and prodded by people who are just trying to provoke you, can be very difficult not to respond; Block and Mute buttons are your friend
- Beware of FOMO: Very easy to spin up new projects in web3 due to the code being open source; be careful when jumping into new projects; influencers may be getting paid to pump something that could be a scam; make sure you’re double-checking sources, doing your due diligence

Accelerating Dream DAO on Twitter (Prof):

- Tagging people to create a positive feedback loop/network effects; lift people from the DAO up by tagging them/retweeting etc.
- Don’t be afraid to expand your network by commenting;
- Post/share/engage, even if it’s not about Dream DAO; the more you engage, the more you’ll learn
- Spread the solarpunk love!

## Provocation/Question: Do you use TikTok for entertainment or education?

- Karl: TikTok is banned in India, but I use Instagram in the same way; I use it primarily for educational stuff
- Ash: I refuse to touch TikTok because it’s so easily addicting; curated an Instagram feed instead of educational content
- Charlotte: 50/50 accounts I support (Washington Post, climate action groups) vs. entertainment
- Jae-Hee: I have TikTok on my phone, but I can’t use it for very long; it feels like it’s rewiring my brain; can’t see an educational TikTok happening in the near future

## Provocation/Question: What jumped out/was surprising from today’s discussion?

- Karl: Twitter Spaces; I didn’t realize they were so cool. I’m not a podcast person, but the Spaces discussions help me get an understanding because they’re not in one direction
- Ash: Have found cool people to follow that don’t have big followings
- Charlotte: Always thought of Twitter as a wasteland of thought and it never seemed very productive; now see how it can be more targeted and reach people in different ways
- Oliver: How I use social media has changed a lot over time; being able to engage is a really interesting part of Twitter; Twitter introduces the idea of intentionality and that flows into other activities

## Provocation/Question: Were you on Twitter before Dream DAO?

- Arath: Yes, but only following celebrities/news accounts
- Ash: Gary made me; I post/retweet things when Gary asks me to
