## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Josh

- Nishant is one of the co-founders of Lomads, a platform in which DAOs can organise themselves, make payments based on tasks, milestones and certain points to make a DAO organisation very clear and decentralised.
- NFTs are art pieces in the market that are unique and non-fungible, this means that cannot be bought by someone else if you hold the piece.
- Nishant explained us that a soulband token are digital identity tokens that represent the traits, features, and achievements that make up a person or entity. He told us that are non-transferable tokens representing a person‚Äôs identity, this could include medical records, work history, and any type of information that makes up a person or entity.
- Soulbound tokens can record music and be more active instead of passive. This is possible cause of music tastes and preferences.
- In Lomads platform you can see soulbound tokens in your dashboard and use add-ons like notion for you organisation and operations part.
- The advantage of blockchain is that being more organised, you will succeed in your operations field.
- You use encrypted information to protect your identity and perms; when you are designing the contract you can either decide if you want to make some information encrypted or not, that depends on what Dream DAO wants to share or make public.
- The concept of Non-Fungible tokens are art piece that you can give it to other by sold them but cannot be transfer to others as an NFT cause you hold it.
- Your souldbound token can make a register of your favourite artist and music.
- In Lomads the tasks you do, milestones and duties are recorded in your soulbound token as the music example, here you can see all your work and gain voting rights in the DAO you are based on the soulbound token. If you are working in 3 organizations you will have 3 soulbound tokens and this helps your profile in governance and reputation!
- You cannot give your soulbound tokes to anyone else - this is very important!

## Provocation/Question: In a token, can I control with info i want to show?

- Nishant: Yes! the person that is controlling the smart contract can control what information to show before they minted.
- Mirna: the organization is going to control this?
- Nishant: every organisation decides how to encrypt the info of the soulbound token.

## Provocation/Question: Is a soulbound token can be a reputation token?

- Nishant: Yes! people can decide how it takes this, it can be part of governance and part of a reputation system.
