## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by <Aaryan>

- Mission: regenerate global ecosystems of Fifth World
- Kris is working on a DAO incubated by them since 2022, he‚Äôs exploring the relationship bw traditional companies and DAOs
- We will be looking at: i) what is a company, ii) what is a DAO, iii) how can they co-exist, enhance each other
- He believes DAOs will not replace but enhance traditional companies
- As companies grow, innovation becomes harder to complex structures and further incentive for profit. In traditional companies, structure of employment is very rigid (board, chief executives, vice presidents, managers etc‚Ä¶) All successful web2/traditional companies follow this
    - benefits: clear order, hierarchy, accountability, responsibility, clear career path of promotion, growth, forms internal communities and collaboration culture automatically, automatically creates learning opportunities from seniors for professional development
    - drawbacks: lack of innovation, transparency, autonomy, coordination, employees dont have voice
- DAOs: exist for global coordination (Across borders, disciplines, fields), help share resources
    - benefits: permissionless innovation, anyone can contribute, adaptable structure, they can flex and change, efficiency using smart contracts will reduce bureaucracy, transparency: funding and decisions are managed publicly, all participants get a voice
    - drawbacks: hacking, legal status is not sure, voting can be slow, lack of coordination to no centralised authority
    - DAOs add anti-fragility to the concept of companies, mistakes help it grow and single points of failure are not as important
- Other Topics Discussed:
    - Co-existing of DAOs and Companies
    - Benefits to companies and DAOs
    - Process of Decentralization
    - the 5th world mission
    - Regeneration ‚Üí we are part of nature/ecosystems and we need to design systems to fit and benefit that, not deplete and harm it
    - V Dao ‚Üí working with artists to imagine what life in a regenerative earth would work, and also funding scientific work for regeneration in agriculture and promoting this message to traditional agriculture

Most Notes are within this document itself, very self explanatory and the session is mostly just a reading/explanation of this

## Provocation/Question:

- Agraforest DAO is similar to V Dao
    - this is a global effort requiring collaboration and lot of change makers
    - V Dao‚Äôs

## Provocation/Question:

- question: are there any optimization methods to increase a DAO's output/decrease time delays that generally come with the lack of a hierarchy?
    - in terms of community building
    - delegation is v important
    - there are some DAO members not involved in everyday management and decision making, delegation solves a lot of that

## Provocation/Question:

- if DAOs start to become more mainstream, what are ways to ensure that they can maintain or exceed the efficiency of communication and delegation in traditional organisations.
    - dao‚Äôs are remote first generally
    - requires active communication
    - DAO cultures promotes responsibility and technology like smart contracts will play a big rol
    - I shared the link to session on liberating structures to talk about communication more!

## Reflections and Takeaways (10 mins)

*What is one thing you learned from this lecture + conversation? What new questions did you develop during this session?*

*What can we do better next time? How can we improve our next session?* 

Unfortunately, due to poor internet I disconnected towards the end and the speaker had left, the session ended before I could facilitate the reflectionüòü
