## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Charlotte

- Verina went to Baruch College and studied Economics, as well as Political Science and Cognitive Science.  She went into traditional finance at JP Morgan.  She rotated between different areas and finally found a blockchain product role.  In February, she joined Coinbase as a Business Development Manager to push Coinbase in different directions.  Verina is now returning to JP Morgan in a role to try to bridge traditional finance and web3.
- Money has evolved over time.  We‚Äôve used barter systems and a gold standard.  We introduced bank notes for convenience.
- Money has to have three things to be considered money.  There must be a medium of exchange (we‚Äôve agreed to accept it as currency), store of value (it holds its value), and unit of accounting (set definition of value).
- Ryan Adams believes that ETH falls into the definition of a Triple Point Asset.
- A $1 is a $1 because that is the value assigned to it.  When the gold standard disappeared, fiat money was the replacement - the government backs the currency.  What happens when the government is no longer able to back or protect the value of the money?
- Payment systems right now include market participants - B2C, B2B, C2C.  Business to consumer, business to business, consumer to consumer.
- Payment systems also have different channels.  There are paper-based checks, RTGS (wires) (high value), RTNS (ACH) (low value, usually recurring), cards (credit/debit), and RTP (new system that combines high and low value, 24/7).
- There are issues with current systems.  Payments are expensive, with limited visibility, the risk of trapped liquidity, and long timeframes for transfers.

- Blockchain could change the entire future of payment systems.  However, there is a currently a lot of regulation and scrutiny, so it isn‚Äôt being employed right now.
- David: How hard will it be to make that change?
    - It‚Äôs not going to be one change.  These rails have been up forever, so it has to be done in increments.  Banks are trying, but it‚Äôs difficult.  This is why we see FinTechs - they have more room.
- Afghans weren‚Äôt able to withdraw their money; there was a run on the bank.  This happened because of the banking system, and it‚Äôs something that can be solved.  Web3 can give people access to their money.  Crypto can be a lifeline.

## Provocation/Question: How do you see JPs role in crypto compared to like Celo or HBAR who are also focusing on international bank transfers?

- Verina: I think they‚Äôre different.  In general, Celo and HBAR are much smaller - they might be focused one aspect of the value chain.  JP Morgan has a wider range and will be working directly with the big names.

## Provocation/Question: How large is the crypto focused wing of JP Morgan, do you feel like most members of the company see its value or is there still lots of skepticism?

- Verina: Actually, one of the main reasons I was okay with going back to JP Morgan is because I see a lot of people that are okay with it.  When I was a product manager, I saw skepticism and had a hard time navigating the bureaucracy.  The role I‚Äôm coming into now is better suited to me.  We‚Äôll be showing the value of JP Morgan to crypto protocols at conferences, etc.

## Provocation/Question: How did you get into economics and learn about payment systems?

- Verina: Honestly, it was something that happened by accident.  In high school, I was interested in the housing crash.  In college, I realized that learning economics makes you a worldly person.  Other careers also didn‚Äôt interest me.  Once I started at JP Morgan, I became more specifically involved with payment systems.  (I did a lot of networking to start it.)
