Notes by <Rashmika Vinakota>

- Involved in crypto from 2015 / previously a lawyer
- Legal hackers - 2000 volunteers from various backgrounds. Hacking the law, to solve real world problems. variety of subjects including what blockchain tech could do.
- What did we do as legal hackers? Learn. hack. Discuss. Something related to verticals but it gave structure/instruction to the community.
- A lot of freedom and it has some basic principles through which they grew their movement
- It started around 2012, Camila joined in 2015.
- Believes in crypto/blockchain
- Lawyers only usually act when the problem is out there, not much room to be creative when the problem is already out there. It changes lawyers‚Äô way of thinking when they reach out to the larger community, to structure projects to make them compliant.

## Provocation/Question: How does Celo select the projects they want to contribute to?

- Celo is opensource and available online
- Anyone can build on Celo without explicitly asking for permission
- How can you engage within Celo? There are individuals, DAOs, etc that collaborate with and within Celo.
- Celo camp - incubator for projects. A committee will assess your idea, upon acceptance, you will get access to a bootcamp. how to build your website, how to do token economics, etc. Competition. Get funding and help
- Engage in other projects. Connect the World.
- Go to Celo‚Äôs discord and ask.
- People want to build for diversity, inclusivity, things that empower the community.

## Provocation/Question: DO you think we‚Äôll see a lot of other professions involved in web3?

- The way I see things are working is through **collaboration**
- The more diverse people are in terms of backgrounds, the more (wholesome?) it will be
- Maybe why some professions aren‚Äôt getting involved in web3 right now is because they don‚Äôt get the ‚Äúclick‚Äù on the integration between their profession and web3. They are not aware of the opportunity.
