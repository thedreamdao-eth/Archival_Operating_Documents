## Provocation/Question: Culture, [mimetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimesis), art, and regeneration...

- Kevin: DeFi summer took Twitter by storm and happened very fast.  Degen systems or regen systems?  Solarpunk and a sustainable future for humanity can be created by web3.  My values were different than a lot of those in the space (solarpunk, not just cyberpunk).  Quadratic funding and public goods infrastructure funds the commons in non-coercive ways, which brings groups together.
- Gary: Web3 is a game-changer for people that feel boxed in by labels/groups.  Gitcoin has fanatics that range the entire political spectrum.  Impact unites people.
- Kevin: Mimetics and understanding of mimetics is super important.  If you can get people to spread your ideas, the ideas will spread.  Things that are viral are often the things that create an emotional reaction.  How can things like ‚Äúgreen-pill‚Äù be engineered into something that will be spread?  If regeneration can be added in, that‚Äôs how we can make a difference in a network age.
- Kevin: Art was a way to get people in to Gitcoin.  It was a conversation starter with investors in the beginning.  [In reference to robot learning to love] I love the intersection of mechanical robots and the heart.  There is a business model for art; it helps fund the matching pool.
    - Dream DAO art stood out to me.
- Public goods are underfunded because there is a failure to communicate and coordinate.
    - [https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)  Coordination failure is a demon lording over us
    - The Greatest LARP website - level one is to read a comic on fighting coordination failure.
        - Related game in the community w/ NFT auction
    - Dream to write a similar Moloch comic with impact DAOs

## Provocation/Question: What did the transition from company to DAO look like?  What was leftover?  How is participation now encouraged?

- Kevin: There is an obligation to maximize shareholder value.  Kernel, hackathons, and grants are the three sides of Gitcoin.  Nonprofit to DAO, for-profit to company, etc.
- Kevin: Nobody actually uses governance tokens to vote.  They don‚Äôt have the mental bandwidth.  In the Quadratic Lands, voting rights are delegated before tokens are claimed.
    - Other governance systems don‚Äôt have the consent of the governed because people don‚Äôt vote
    - This problem is solved with delegation - FOUNDATIONAL innovation
- It was designed for a lack of governance.  Participation in Gitcoin grants feels like discovering different projects you like but is, in essence, governing.

## Provocation/Question: Transition to a DAO

- Kevin: The Quadratic Lands launched May 2021.  [https://quadraticlands.com/](https://quadraticlands.com/)
    - Rewritten economic laws to fund the commons
    - Turned the program over to the community (company to DAO)
- GTC is the token of the governance network.  Gitcoin should be governed by the group it serves.  I didn‚Äôt want to be stuck in between investors and users.  Closed loop would avoid this issue - ‚Äúconsent of the governed.‚Äù

## Provocation/Question: Is it a question of financial capital constraints or scarce human support?

- Kevin: Gitcoin connects people that are building with people who have capital.  Necessary to match people and capital evenly.  Both sides need to be grown together.  ‚ÄúNetwork effect‚Äù - for every worker that joins Gitcoin, the system gets better for the funder (and other way around).
- Kickstarting this network effect was difficult at first, but Gitcoin succeeded.  Avoided landmines.
- Answer: both matter.  The coordination in between is difficult.  People with capital want to find projects that meet their value systems but have limited time... the system needs to be coordinated so matches can be made.

## Provocation/Question: How do we make sure that people donate to projects that will make the biggest impact?  Is there a roadmap to convene people or promote coordination?

- Kevin: My personal values don‚Äôt matter.  Gitcoin creates a real democracy that help the community hear their own values.  What if the community has bad preferences?  Quadratic funding is subject to this issue - we only fund what we see.  Imperfect mechanism.
    - Community can debate preferences and values - don‚Äôt want to be seen as tipping the scales
- Kevin: We haven‚Äôt figured everything out yet.  Impact DAOs are the scalable unit of regenerative cryptoeconomics.  Currently focused on meeting DAOs and showing people they exist - collaboration will fall into place.
    - [https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-vision-for-a-pluralistic-civilizational-scale-infrastructure-for-funding-public-goods/9503](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-vision-for-a-pluralistic-civilizational-scale-infrastructure-for-funding-public-goods/9503)
    - Do no harm; aligned set of incentives that don‚Äôt elbow each other out or compete
    - 

## Provocation/Question: Gitcoin‚Äôs Founding

- Kevin: Open source software = digital infrastructure
- There was no business model for open source software - people had to work nights and during their free time.
- Gitcoin corrected that.  Money is sent to open source software.  Double-sided marketplace.
- Growing platform: bounties, grants (quadratic funding!), hackathons, etc.
- [https://gitcoin.co/results](https://gitcoin.co/results)
- Focus on open source software to all digital public goods (many categories)
    - Space for global public goods that transcends borders
- Quadratic Funding
    - ‚ÄúMathematically optimal way to fund public goods in a democratic community‚Äù
    - Optimized for grants with the broadest base of support, not the deepest support
    - Gets past the ‚Äúfreerider‚Äù problem
- Ale Borda: Huge inspiration to see.

Are there thoughts on if we should start shifting towards giving more info on the impact of projects and the potential to add value to the ecosystem so people can make best decisions? Or does this go against free decisions? And to support projects beyond funding to make collaborations between them as well as give them resources!

- Additional questions/provocation
    - Madison: What specific things must be done to ensure that crypto is a regenerative tool as opposed to degenerative?
        - Charlotte: What are the current pitfalls of cryptocurrency that need to be addressed in the coming years?
    - Oliver: How can crypto address the multi-faceted environmental problems we face in a way other systems cannot? (What are its unique advantages, and is crypto more suited for adressing the complexity of the issues)
    - Ale: How do you see crypto playing a role in not only regenerating our environment but also redefining the underlying systems creating other societal issues
    - Jae-Hee: I feel like there's been a general trend across history where humans have become better and better at quantifying, packaging, and commercializing many aspects of our lives. How do you think crypto ‚Äî which relies on a fundamental system of owning and trading and transacting ‚Äî will play into how society sees & engages with itself?
    - Ale: Thinking about global coordination to what extent is this achieved by setting strong values and frameworks where strong coordination and collaboration naturally happens vs having people/DAOs play the role of stewarding this coordination across changemakers. How do we reach STIGMERGY!
    - Ale: What is the biggest barrier/opportunity ahead to achieve the vision of a global, pluralistic Public Goods Rebel Alliance to support all public goods
    - Rashmika: Can crypto help us create a better and more efficient education system and how?
    - Ale: How does he approach the role of a steward and leader of Gitcoin DAO as someone who establishes an ever evolving north star and enables all contributors to co-create? What have been his biggest learnings stirring Gitcoin forward and what would he recommend to others who want to positively lead their organizations forward
    - Ethan: Also, "what effect might ubiquitous regenerative cryptoeconomic projects play for the behavior of people? will people rationalize the depletion of even more resources because they know it can be regenerated?‚Äù
    - most inspiring leaders in the regen world right now?
    - role of memes (shareable ideas) in regeneration

## Reflections and Takeaways (10 mins)

*What is one thing you learned from this lecture + conversation? What new questions did you develop during this session?*

- Roman: Thanks for hosting this session.  Thinking about new ways to fund public goods is eye-opening.  Coming into the Dream DAO, I didn‚Äôt know about all of these avenues.
    - Kevin: Ethereum/web3 is a point for the hopeful
- Jared: Seeing climate as a topic of importance is very encouraging.
    - Thanks for joining us today! If you ever need anything from Mayo Clinic, please drop me a line ‚Äî¬†there could be some public health public goods we might help inform/contribute to
    - Kevin: Proof of stake transition can make this topic explode.
- Chauncey: Thank you so much for your time here Kevin! greatly appreciated, and would love to connect again in future on what we're doing with Angel Protocol and planning for public goods funding on Terra.
- Madison: i really want dream dao to contribute to solving low voter turnout in daos. when people are paying for membership they clearly want to participate just don‚Äôt have the mental capacity to do so. let‚Äôs get creative and make it more accessible! it‚Äôs our job!
- Angelina: Thank you so much for this lecture! I didn't realize until now how many things can and should actually be seen as public goods - def changed my perspective on that
- Ale: Seeing everyone who stands for building new systems is inspiring and exciting.  Vision and mission is crucial.
- Carl: Watching this work evolve has made me excited.  How can we create a new, optimistic and hopeful narrative?  Thank you for your work.
    - Kevin: Next epoch is about impact DAOs finding each other.
- Allison: Thanks so much for this! Although I‚Äôve been on here for 20 minutes (had dance right before this) - I never realized how much web3 and DAO can really help solve certain issues by building new systems!
- Jae-Hee: I am blown away by how capital is leveraged to unite us with Gitcoin.  How can we convince Gen-Z peers that crypto can be positive?
    - Kevin: Actions speak louder than words.  Check out the results.
    - Jae-Hee: I was able to help reassure a friend about NFTs today - good sign for the future.
    - Compare web3 and web2.  Art doesn‚Äôt have a business model in web2.  Web3 has new business models - shift the framing.
- Fran - Joined DreamDAO to use some of the tools of crypto for good. I‚Äôm encouraged to see multiple people thinking about this thoughtfully and making the most of our capitalist system.
- Oliver: I am hopeful, especially after this conversation, because of the systems.  Not despite them.  The systems can be built for hope specifically.
    - Kevin: Transferring from industrial age to information age institutions.  There is a future - still, we need to work to build the systems.
- Ahyun: This was so inspiring! The constant thing I realise when diving into the crypto world and web3 is that we have the potential to solve existing divisions and problems AND nurture new ways in which societies can grow. It‚Äôs interesting to look at this in a new perspective! Must go now- thank you so much!
- Charlotte: Thank you so much for your insight! I really enjoyed hearing your perspective, especially on the future of coordination and the implications of coordination failure.
- Gary: Gitcoin and those involved helped get the Dream DAO going.  The Dream DAO took inspiration from Gitcoin imaging to create and promote solarpunk.

*What can we do better next time? How can we improve our next session?*
