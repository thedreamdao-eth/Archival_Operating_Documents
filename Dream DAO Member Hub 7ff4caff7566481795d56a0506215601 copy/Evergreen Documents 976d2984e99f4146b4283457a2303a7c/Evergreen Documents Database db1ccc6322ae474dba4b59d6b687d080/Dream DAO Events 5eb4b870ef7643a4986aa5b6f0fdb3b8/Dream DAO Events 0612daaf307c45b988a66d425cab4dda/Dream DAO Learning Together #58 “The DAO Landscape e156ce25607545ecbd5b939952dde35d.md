## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Prabhat

### Introduction:

- what are DAOs- Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. a distributed collective structure. People work together towards a shared goal. DAOs efficiently organize work. Core members (high context) + freelancers (low context). DAO: a group chat with a bank account (informal).
- you can bring people from all over the world together- give tools for membership and voting and incentives!
- DAO ideal (you can bring people from all over the world together- give tools for membership and voting and incentives!) vs. DAO in practice (no healthcare benefits, need to look into third-party providers, etc.)
- Who has heard Nouns, Gitcoin, Uniswap? 50% of the people in this LT have heard about these DAOs.

### The DAO landscape:

Impact DAOs

- impact DAO is a DAO that works towards a social cause. Work on both online and offline ecosystem: create digital infrastructure (work on online stuff), to create an eco village/address climate change (work on offline causes). Basically work on positive social impact. E.g. Klima DAO, ReFi DAO, Ukraine DAO (raised ~$40m for Ukraine), Proof of Humanity.

Protocol DAOs

- oldest, msot established DAOs. goal to create important infrastructure for the internet and make sure it runs smoothly. Create code (smart contracts) that are intended to run forever and push minor improvements over time. E.g. POAP, Uniswap, Maker DAO (DAI stablecoin), Aave (lend/borrow protocol), Lido (staking), etc.

Grants DAOs

- DAOs that give out money (non-equity funding) to fund projects that enhance a particular ecosystem! e.g. Gitcoin (uses QF), Optimism (L2 that helps scale Ethereum), MolochDAO (distribute funding to different projects on Ethereum), Spirals (helping people stake their coins and the yield is given to imapct projects). These DAOs are really important- fund projects that are really new and help them flourish (doesn‚Äôt involve outside players).

Media DAOs

- they‚Äôre projects that try to decentralize media. e.g.- Rehash (decentralized podcast- people vote on who they want on the podcast), Rekt (content about privacy), Forefront (work with freelancers to create a decentralized editorial column), Mirror (writing), bankless (podcast, newsletter, work with writers about crypto and web3).

Service DAOs

- hire people expd. in a particular industry. e.g. LexDAO (lawyers), Developer DAO (software devs), YGG (Yield Guild Games - GameFi DAO: provide scholarships to people who wanna play NFT games), etc.

Investment DAOs

- people will pool their money to invest / put together an index fund. e.g. Index, Seed Club, MetaCartelDAO, etc.

Learning DAOs

- impart education by creating a platform / program about some element about web3. e.g. ZKDAO, Rabbit Hole (create content that helps onboard people into web3; learn to earn), Invisible College (based on Solana)

Social DAOs

- e.g. Nouns (NFT project, NFT ownership gives membership), Bored Ape Yacht Club, Friends with Benefits (newsletters, meetups, events, etc.), KrausHaus (save up to buy).

Creative DAOs 

- Metalabel (extend the concept of a label), DoinGud (collection of artists to support social imapct causes), SongCamp (music NFTs, distrubuted music), Incubator (on NEAR, artist/research collective)

Network State DAOs

- land/property. e.g. - CabinDAO (IRL meetups in Texas), City DAO (in the state of Wyoming), Decentraland (in the metaverse), etc.

DAO Tooling DAOs

- offers workplace benefit to DAO employees like healthcare benefits, HR, tech tools etc. e.g. - Utopia Labs (payment systems for DAOs), Clarity (organize DAO content), etc.

Collector DAOs

- e.g. - Loot (group of people that like games), PleasrDAO (collect expensive art pieces and collectively own it!), Proof, etc.

Note: Dream DAO: people think Dream DAO has aspects of a social DAO, learning DAO, Impact DAO, etc.    

### How to DAO (discussion about positives and negatives of DAOs):

- for Dream DAO, builders start with a clean slate in web3 (which is very good!)
- DAOs need legal representation since it is a very new concept (clash b/w nation state interests and web3 principles).
- there is a strong feeling of trust and solidarity in the community. People are excited to work together to work towards a shared goal.
- DAOs are good incubators of new ideas.
- How to join DAOs- join discord, what they‚Äôre working on, DMing the correct people about how you wanna contribute, propose own project. [https://twitter.com/chaserchapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman) (great resource about learning more about DAOs and how to get more involved.

## Provocation/Question: why are DAOs on a specific blockchain? - Prabhat

- DAO membership is generally through a token/NFT (that is on a particular chain). DAOs are mostly centered on ethereum tooling, however, this is changing (polygon, optimism, etc.).
