Rebeca: Web3 is huge and the space is growing and Devcon is a representative of that and it was amazing to see people from diverse backgrounds and industries interact. Even though it was mainly for developers, it was very welcoming regardless and non-technical people could also get just as involved.

There was diversity in terms of background, gender, etc.

Amanda: They really integrated Colombian culture and embraced it and gave people a glimpse of the culture. It was accessible in terms of language eg: Spanish translations etc. 

It was nice having an in person event and network with different people. It put my skepticisms at ease as everyone was humanized and you can see action being taken and impact being made. You can get insights to what people are working on.

Carl: It felt like a family gathering. This was by far the most regen and the best. A group of people united by the same values and ambition and it was developer heavy. Because it was in Colombia, it was diverse, accessible. Shelling point was a more intimate setting were regens could get together.

The only difficult thing it that it can be tiring cuz you’re exposed to a variety of things that are unfamiliar.

Julieta: the event pushed me out of my comfort zone because I learnt alot.

Joshua:  

## Rohit: How were the side events?

SBS showed how ReFi can be used to combat climate change.

There were also events that onboarded beginners to the world of Web3 b explaining the basics.

## Prabhat: How has your perspective evolved after attending Devcon?

People talked about how we can use it for good and Web3 is not as different as we think it is. There are orgs that are Web2 flavored but they are using blockchain and they are actively working towards trying to fund public goods instead of generating revenue.

## Rohit: since most of you talked about how it was for Developers. Did you find yourself being confused or lost at what was being discussed or talked about at times?

Fernando: Since I was new to the Web3 space I did find some of the topics confusing. It was ALOT of info to absorb from all the talks but at the end of the week, I wished to do it all over again because I had a new found passion towards the field so eventually it all worked out.
