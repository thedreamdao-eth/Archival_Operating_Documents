## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Ash Kranti

- Maia Monell, focuses on improving financial health through daily habit-building, co-found and Chief Growth Officer at Nav.it
- Oftentimes, people aren‚Äôt taught basic financial best practices, which can impact not only financial health but physical health (due to stress).
- 76% of Americans report financial anxiety.
- Only 4% of US colleges offer a personal financial literacy program.
- People need to be exposed to money management earlier in life.
- Web3 opens up the possibility to create a whole new system for financial health!
- Your mindset matters!
    - Resilience/Grit: Keep going! Keep working to learn how to manage your finances and bounce back from difficulties.
    - Knowledge: It‚Äôs so important to be aware of your finances and strategies you can use to manage and grow them.
    - Mindfulness: Be aware of your emotions and create mindful, proactive strategies to reduce stress. Examine why finances may cause you stress and where those originate from!
- Tips:
    - Have an emergency fund: If you ever need extra cash, saving in advance can ensure you have it on-hand. This doesn‚Äôt always have to be associated with stress or an emergency.
    - Pay off High Interest Debt: Not all debt is bad, but high-interest debt such as credit card loans can seriously harm your short-term and long-term financial health. Good debt might include a mortgage or other assets.
    - Spend less than you earn: It‚Äôs important to think ahead and save for the future.
- Banks make money on fees and lending, while you make money saving, earning, and investing.
- There are a ton of different ways to grow your wealth.
    - Real estate is one way, but it requires long-term planning and self-advocacy, as well as maintenance and the costs associated with that.
    - Investments - there are a ton of different options from retirement funds to stocks and bonds.
    - Entrepreneurship is a great way - you can go the route of freelancing and side hustles or start your own initiative (with long-term growth in mind).
    - Insurance-Wealth protection is a great way to ensure your money, whether that‚Äôs through life insurance or disability insurance.
- Risk is an inevitable part of money management. Ask yourself what your risk tolerance is - how much are you willing to risk? How does risk play into your long-term goals?
- Try putting together a thesis for your life and aligning your financial decisions with that thesis.
- Utilise the people around you to make better long-term practices! Saving circles and/or peer-to-peer lending are great opportunities to work with those around you to improve your personal and communal financial health.
- Web3 presents an opportunity to make people familiar with financial health and money management early on.

## Provocation/Question: What is your advice to parents trying to teach sustainable practices?

- Maia: Disclaimer, not a parent. Talk about finance everywhere, from dinner table to office. These conversations need to be normalize to reduce stress and stigma. Kids need to ask questions and get advice from others. Parents need to start conversations and be open about what‚Äôs happening. Break the barrier between parents and kids about financial health early so it doesn‚Äôt build up over time and cause harm. Play experiential games to accompany the conversations! Let kids get experience in thoughtful investing early, if possible.

## Provocation/Question: What mindset and focus advice would you give to a young person who wants to start their venture with little money and is pressured by that?

- Maia: Give yourself grace. We often set high expectations for ourselves, higher than we would for others. Choose a couple of mission-critical things to focus on and be okay with letting other things go! It‚Äôs completely unsustainable to do everything. Figure out how to build your income steam without burning yourself out.

## Provocation/Question: How has your passion in this field developed over time?

- Maia: Started by building a team that focused on using predictive AI to influence professional athletes‚Äô outcomes and experiences, a form of risk assessment for field performance. Found that athletes who had more wealth were less stressed, started to continue exploring how financial health was a result of chronic stress and measure its impact on their lives and athletic performance. Met a co-founder (behavioral scientist) who helped her build where she is now! Now, she measures how detrimental government and lack of social support systems impact financial health.
- Maia to group: How do we ensure finances don‚Äôt follow the same patterns as traditional financial services?
- Ash Kranti: Plethora of money in the space is life-changing. Accessibility of talented people and advisors make lessons in financial health and success easier to understand.
- Kunal: There‚Äôs less gatekeeping in web3 - people are looking for skills, not titles. +1 on Ash‚Äôs points.
- Maia: How do people feel about money mindsets?
- Ash Kranti: Usually get frustrated when people tell me to save or strategize more when I‚Äôm already going it.
- Maia: Recognition is crucial! Emotions have a huge impact on success and performance.

## Provocation/Question: How can you test risk tolerance throughout your life?

- Maia: Understand what your peers‚Äô risk tolerance is and use that as a jumping-off point for your own risk assessment.
- Maia: Many people take more risk when they‚Äôre younger because they have more time to recover from anything that goes wrong. Although, never invest more than you‚Äôre willing to lose.
- Maia: Would love to see a game that explores and simulates different investment scenarios throughout ages and generations.
- Kunal: Do you think that simulations make it harder for people to take financial health seriously?
- Maia: Peer-to-peer influence and experiences could be a solution - people have more skin in the game and responsibility to one another.
