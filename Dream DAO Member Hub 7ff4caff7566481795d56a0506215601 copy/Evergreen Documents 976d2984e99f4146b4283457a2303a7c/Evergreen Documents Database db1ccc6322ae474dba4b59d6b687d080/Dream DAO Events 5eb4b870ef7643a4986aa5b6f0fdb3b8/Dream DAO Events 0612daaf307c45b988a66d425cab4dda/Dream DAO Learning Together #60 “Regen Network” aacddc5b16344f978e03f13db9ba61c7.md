## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by <Fernando Cruz>

- Sarah has been working in climate impact for almost 15 years.
- Sarah explains that Regen Network‚Äôs infrastructure originates digital carbon assets, unlocking web3 regenerative finance.
- Regen Network is connected with many web3 developers, builders, and web3 people.
- A community can create a standard for many activities or can design a project related to climate change.
- Communities can use blockchain wallets to implement their climate projects in the blockchain by using their marketplace.
- Sarah said that using the Regen Marketplace, corporate sustainability departments and government entities striving to meet their climate commitments are encouraged to purchase, transfer, retire, and pool tokenized carbon on the blockchain for carbon offset purposes.
- Regen Network runs an ecological impact and new methodology development community with scientists, project developers, and climate impact researchers.
- Sara explains that faulty economic models around the world encourage land degradation, destroy ecosystems, and fuel climate change, and for this problem, Regen Network proposes a solution in which regenerative land use practices are encouraged, you restore ecosystems and
climate change is reversed.
- Sara comments that Regen Network features a suite of digital carbon credits with green co-benefits including CarbonPlus, City Forest Credits, and NCT.
- Regen Network Marketplace allows at least 4 blockchains by using their Ethereum wallet.
- Also, Sarah explains that Regen Registry (a part of Regen Network) allows Earth stewards to sell their ecosystem services directly to buyers around the world.
