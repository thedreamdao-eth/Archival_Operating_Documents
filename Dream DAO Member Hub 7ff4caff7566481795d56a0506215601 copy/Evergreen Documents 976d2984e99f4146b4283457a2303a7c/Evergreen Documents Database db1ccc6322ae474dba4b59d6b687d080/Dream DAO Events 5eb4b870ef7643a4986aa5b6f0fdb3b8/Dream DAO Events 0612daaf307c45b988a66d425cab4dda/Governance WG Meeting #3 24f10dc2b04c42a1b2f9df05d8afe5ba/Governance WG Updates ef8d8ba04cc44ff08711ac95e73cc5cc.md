# 🏛️Current Governance Design

## 🤝Meetings

<aside>
❗ **Meetings are now weekly, 30 mins long, and on just one topic**

</aside>

- The owner of the task leads the meeting on the task
    - The task owner should come to the meeting with a prepared agenda, which includes open questions they have along with topics from the feedback

### Meeting topic list:

1. **Chabu’s governance doc (The next one)**
2. **Prof’s Partnerships Proposal** 
3. **Treasury Management**
4. **Merit System**

## 💼Task Management

- When people are commenting on documents, they will indicate which topics they want to discuss synchronously (during the meeting) with the term “**wgd**”. Otherwise, the task owner will incorporate the feedback directly.
    - The owner of a task could have an open jam session with anyone in the DAO
- Tasks with a group of owners will be discussed/completed in a WG thread
