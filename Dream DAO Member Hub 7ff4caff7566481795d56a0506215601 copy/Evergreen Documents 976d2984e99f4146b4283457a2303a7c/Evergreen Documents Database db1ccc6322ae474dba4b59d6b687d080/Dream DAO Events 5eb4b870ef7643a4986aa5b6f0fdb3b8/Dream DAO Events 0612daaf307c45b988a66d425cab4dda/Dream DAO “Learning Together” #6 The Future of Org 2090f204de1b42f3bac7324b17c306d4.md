## Presentation (30 mins)

- Teal: Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness
- The book: *Reinventing Organizations* by Frederic Laloux
- Teal organization reinvented their strategy together and everyone was comfortable with the decisions made.  People making decisions seemed like a really good value.
- When people work together, the ability to succeed is higher.
    - Human organization has brought with it exponential GDP growth
    - Life expectancy has increased due to human organization
- However, people don’t trust current organizations.
    - Symptom: the Great Resignation
- To solve these issues, we need to reinvent our systems/organizations.
- History of human organizations:
    - Red - reactive “Wolf Packs” with short-term focuses.  One “chief” as leading authority.
    - Amber - formal, top-down control with “Armies.”  Hierarchy allows processes to repeat.
    - Orange - “Well-Oiled Machines” that work to beat competition with shorter-term focuses and goals.  Breakthroughs in innovation, responsibility, and meritocracy.
    - Green - culture and empowerment motivate employees in “Families.”  Stakeholders are equal to if not more important than shareholders.
        - A sense emerges that organizational culture is valuable
    - Teal - the future of human organizations?
        - **Self-management** over hierarchy
        - **Wholeness** = supporters bring their best selves in an environment with norms
        - Organization is a living organism with emergent and **evolutionary** properties
            - No formal strategy - listening for ideas throughout
            - Anti-fragile
        - *DAOs can lend themselves to teal-style organizations*
    - Note: all types of organizations exist and are needed in the present day
- Madison: How do teal organizations accommodate the needs of workers in larger society?
    - Teal Case Study: Celo/cLabs uses job titles externally to accommodate our current society but internally does not
- Teal Case Study: Valve has employees work on what they believe is most valuable and what they believe that can contribute to.
- Teal Case Study: Morning Star has employees write letters explaining salary raises they believe they should be given - most employees make cost-of-living adjustments, but employees that go above and beyond may choose a higher rate.
    - Employees are skilled at assessing the compensation they deserve
- Chabu: There is an interesting evolution of organizations - DAOs merge a first vision with other people.
    - Together, people can find goals and purpose in an organization.
- Francisco: What metrics are there to suggest teal organizations are more successful?
    - We don’t currently have empirical evidence that this works.  However, you can’t just measure based on profit.  Profitable companies can have dissatisfied employees, etc.
    - A lot of the world currently has orange and green structure.  Values depend on the context and purpose of the organization.
- Teal Criticisms:
    - Teal organizations can seem elitist to those on the outside who haven’t experienced it.
        - This is a valid critique, but the ideas can be shared.
    - Teal organizations are a framework - no one is adopting all principles fully.
    - Teal ideas can miss modern ideas.

## Provocation/Question: What makes it difficult to run a teal organization?

- Jae-Hee: It is difficult to place a lot of trust in people these days.  Blockchain itself is inherently “trustless.”  The Dream DAO was lucky because it came from people who already knew each other.  Teal organizations can’t scale like that.
- Madison: Top-down management is the easiest.  There isn’t a formula for integrating the interests of many in teal organizations.
- Dariel: Who would settle disputes in teal organizations?
    - Gary: Governance rules have to be established beforehand.  Many DAOs fail within the first year because it is difficult to run and variable between all groups.
- Carl: Many groups have failed from a business perspective, but the members succeeded themselves - they had more money and personal knowledge.  Co-ops expanded possibilities for the people.
- Ahyun: New approaches to organization require background.  People need the skills to properly interact and engage.  How can the education system integrate these values (of teal organizations)?  It’s necessary.
    - Gary: I’m skeptical of the potential of the education system in this manner - teachers themselves were taught in non-teal organizations.  Communities of learning like the Dream DAO could fill the hole.

## Provocation/Question: Have teal organizations emerged because they are inherently better, or because our values as a society have evolved?

- Carl: That’s a great question.  The pandemic is an example.  Green could have moved back to orange; instead, teal has emerged more because people want to connect and explore new options.  Humans think we are making forward progress - this needs mass action.
- Chabu: More of a reflection of values/needs of society right now than the “best” way.  Teal wouldn’t have made sense when people were conquering lands.  Teal works in today’s culture with today’s context.
- Madison: Maybe its more effective because values have shifted?
- Ahyun: I agree with Chabu.  It’s not inherently better, but it fits with the context of our society and the ways our goals have shifted.  We are looking towards more decentralized organizations.  Even if teal is not the end, it is a springboard to the future.
- Jae-Hee: I think it’s inherently better because it kind of mirrors the way society makes moral progress?  Teal organizations mirror the fluidity that we can now accommodate after the industrial age.
    - Carl: There is a role for anyone in a DAO.  It’s not just for people that can code.  Teal organizations are creative and evolved enough to create a new workforce.

## Provocation/Question: If teal characteristics are not enforced or growing, what design choices can be made to ensure their success?

- Carl: It comes down to intention and culture.  In some places, knowledge leads to power.  The ethos of teal is to eliminate power dynamics and decentralize as much as possible.
- Chabu: What is incentivizing the growth of other (non-teal) characteristics?  Evaluate and address.
- Gary: Young women often feel they need to display certain characteristics in companies to get ahead.  The environment and context of it is important.

## Provocation/Question: Do individuals want to be teal or have teal characteristics in every situation?

- Gary: The answer is clear.  If we can’t always be teal, however, how should we think of and understand conditional states?
- Chabu: I broke down color categories with certain characteristics.  Different situations require different responses, so it’s important to know what one you need.
- Thessy: I worked without job titles.  It was great internally, but people needed context in external situations.  There is friction between these values.
- Ahyun: There are going to be differences in power in any organization.  This can lead to the loss of some teal characteristics.
- Gary: Yes Ahyun - and it’s foolish to think everyone is equal in context / implicit power / knowledge / skills.  Structure is helpful.

## Provocation/Question: How do teal organizations find the “why” and their evolving purpose?

- Carl: We don’t know where evolving organizations will end up.  A five-year plan or strong purpose can confine the scope of focus.  While this can make goals achievable, it can also reduce our ability to look for new goals.
- Oliver: It is important to look at what you are achieving but also be open to new paths as they come up.
- Gary: Civics Unplugged is a teal organization case study.  The CU “theory of change” has been completely revamped in the last few months.  Our thoughts and goals change; people are messy.  We need to be able to get out of execution mode and instead think about our purpose.  The “why” will shift.
- Carl: We have a vision and mission.  The tactics and paths to get there can and will change.

## Provocation/Question: How do technology and networks influence the idea of human organization?

- Carl: Teal organizations aren’t the end to the evolution of human organization.  However, teal organizations bring excitement in a way that is new.
    - The ideas will be and are incorporated into DAOs and tech spaces.

## Reflections and Takeaways (10 mins)

*What is one thing you learned from this conversation? What new questions did you develop during this session?*

- Jared: There is a lot of crossover between ideas of teal organizations and my interests.  Current interactions I have are being oriented to teal ideas.  The effectiveness of top-down organizations vs. the autonomy of teal organizations is interesting to consider.  It boils down to trust.
- Gary: Trust and fear are not opposites, but they do have a relationship.  How do groups that don’t operate on fear create and promote trust?
- Dariel: There is more to decentralization than the crypto space.
    - Gary: There was decentralization *before* crypto too.
- Madison: Thank you for presenting.  This is such an important and interesting topic.
- Carl: I’m looking at things different now.
- Oliver: The ecosystem created by teal organizations - one of self-management - shows that there is a lot of work to be done in our societal groups today.  Balance is important.
- Charlotte: This was a super interesting topic.  Thank you for presenting.
- Carl: **Check out the book or bibliography in the last slide**.  There aren’t a ton of materials to learn more right now, but more will come out in the future.

*What can we do better next time? How can we improve our next Dream DAO Explorer session?*
