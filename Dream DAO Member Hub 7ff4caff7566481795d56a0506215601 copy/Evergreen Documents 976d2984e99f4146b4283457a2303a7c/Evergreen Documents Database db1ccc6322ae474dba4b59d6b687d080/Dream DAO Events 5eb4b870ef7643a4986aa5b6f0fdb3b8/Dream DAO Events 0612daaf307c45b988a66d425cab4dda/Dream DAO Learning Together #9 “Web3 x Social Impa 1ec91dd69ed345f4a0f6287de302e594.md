## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Charlotte

- web3: read, write, own.  Users have a stake in the technology they interact with on a daily basis.  Blockchain technology is the path towards this.
- Blockchain is a shared database.  Everything within the system is verified through consensus mechanisms.
    - Consensus Mechanisms:
        - Proof of work.  Computers compete to create the hash; it gets more difficult as the system expands.  Proof of work is the most secure, but it requires a lot of energy and is not very scalable.
            - Ethereum and Bitcoin are currently proof of work systems.
        - Proof of stake.  Nodes (validators) are selected to solve the hash function.  It’s less secure but more scalable and requires less energy.
    - Bitcoin.  Data only consists of transactions.  Limited (if any) smart contract ability.
    - Ethereum.  Allows smart contracts and has wider functionality.
        - A smart contract is a self-executing contract with rules already written into the code.  There is no middle man.  Interactions with smart contracts are also irreversible.
- Layer-1 is the underlying, main blockchain.  The base level is built upon with Layer-2.  Currently, Ethereum is the only blockchain with Layer-2s.
- The blockchain is *decentralized*, *trustless*, *transparent*, *permissionless*, and *interoperable.*  Blockchains are also highly *composable.*
    - Everything is recorded and viewable on the blockchain.
    - Participants aren’t required to meet certain standards for entry.
        - Huge for people without access to standard banking, for example
- **Etherisc: A Case Study**
    - Decentralized insurance protocol built on Ethereum to close the “protection gap.”  Each asset of the blockchain is recorded below:
        - It’s open-source; anyone can use or modify the smart contracts.
        - Insurance payouts are completed controlled by smart contracts.  There are no brokers.
        - Because everything is transparent and run by smart contracts, participants are protected against human error and able to check in.
        - Accessible regardless of access to traditional loan facilities.
        - Collects data from “oracles” that use data from the outside world to inform execution of smart contract.
        - Able to adapt to specific contexts with smart contracts (specialty insurance)
- NFTs “represent a unique asset on the blockchain.”  They come in many forms.
- DAOs - decentralized autonomous organizations - take unique qualities of the blockchain and apply them to organizations and groups.
- DeFi = decentralized finance.  In a lot of developed countries, we take finance and regulated financial systems for granted.  This is revolutionary for developing nations.
    - Anyone with an internet connection can use it.
    - Transfer money with minimal fees required.
- **US Paycheck Protection Program: Case Study**
    - $521 billion in loans was given out.  The program was designed to help small businesses, but money went to fake businesses (connected to President Donald Trump’s relations, and other large organizations)
        - 85% of the data was not released; we don’t know what happened with the rest of the money
    - Crypto could help provide transparency of the flow of funds from government to organizations, and from organizations to people within.
    - Smart contracts could ensure funds are only given to those that meet criteria. Can’t be evil > don’t be evil.

Blockchain can make better institutions.

Breakout Rooms held discussions on Relevant News Reader, Hala Systems, SingularityNET, and Moss - examples of the intersection of web3 and social impact.

- Moss: This group discussed carbon emissions and how Moss is working to prevent such emissions.  Carbon markets are able to be corrupted; web3 has lots of potential.  Moss has a lot of interoperability.
- Relevant News Reader: Relevant News Reader gives power to people who have been proven reliable.  On other sites, you have to source and check all of your resources all of the time.  Relevant News Reader is an accessible, healthy way to access news and information.  Reliability > “popularity”
- Hala systems: the article touched on how data generated from the company might not be reliable as it can be tampered with or mishandled. By leveraging the Ethereum network, when a report is submitted the data collected is hashed to the Ethereum blockchain where it will stay there forever and no one is able to tamper with the data. This reflects transparency in data collection with makes it more trustworthy and reliable.
In addition, Using a distributed ledger database increases the efficiency of the  System and develops it into a tool for immediate and accurate reporting of war crimes. Since it's automatically storing data onto the blockchain, Sentry is able to prove that credible data has not been changed or tampered with at any point in time. Overall, leveraging blockchain technology helps with the reliability of data which is critical for accountability and justice efforts to help prevent and mitigate conflicts.

## Reflections and Takeaways (10 mins)

*What is one thing you learned from this lecture + conversation? What new questions did you develop during this session?*

- **Jae-Hee:** This was an amazing presentation!! I feel like this was the first time an “intro to web3” was fully steeped through the social impact lens and the principles of transparency, interoperability, permissionless-ness, etc. were amazing guidelines to examine the case studies! I think it’s becoming more + more clear why these tools can bring out the best parts of our human potential. I am so hopeful!
    - I do wish that Butter would be smoother with connectivity (especially international)
    - Miro was great but I think Butter made it a bit difficult at first
    - Maybe longer breakout rooms for case studies next time?
    - The collaborative part was amazing - decentralized LT sessions! Like QZ did!
- **Arman/Karl:** I LOVED THE ENTRIE LECTURE> IT was so well planned, structured with pre-reading materials, and with content that actually made SO MUCH SENSE you know. However, low member turnout sucks, we could have certainly reached out to others in a bit more effective way to get more ppl into this Amazing LT! But honestly, I must say this was the most collaborative LT I’ve ever been a part of; if Anastasia’s LT was full of reflections for me, then this one was jampacked with Deflections from the Doubts I had initially. I feel way more connected to web3!
- Charlotte: I really appreciated going through all the basics to truly feel like I understand the environment of web3 x social impact.  I’m interested in learning more about the effectiveness/reach of these intersections.  How mainstream can they get?
- Saf: I think we were a bit too ambitious with how many people would show up and also how smoothly the breakout sessions would run. Would have been better to have more time for fewer breakout rooms, and have clearly defined tasks for each breakout room (note-taker, presenter, etc). I thought the Miro integration with Butter worked well, but actually using the platform may not have been as intuitive as I initially thought. Connection issues were a concern, I think Miro + Butter requires a lot of bandwidth which not everyone has access to
- Mirna: I never thought how Carbon credits could be related to the whole blockchain concept, and I’m fascinated by how much the blockchain can contribute towards solving social issues.
- Madhav: Carbon credits are one thing and securing with blockchain is cherry on top. There are ways we can help offset the carbon we put and there is a way to ensure that offsetting is actually happening.
- Lisa: The case studies got me super excited - there’s such cool work happening out there :)  It was really good/helpful to apply the content in the case studies. Curious to learn more about Relevant - thanks Jae-Hee for spearheading that!
- **Ash Kranti:** I think we should work a bit more on the technical end but the content was 10/10! I have so many questions about trust and I can’t wait to explore the ways in which we can apply this to processes throughout our lives. Thank you for a much-needed crash course in social impact and the blockchain :)
- Aditya: The case studies were super interesting and demonstrated web3’s immense scope.
- Aishah: After reading about Hala’s Sentry Warning systems, I realized how beneficial blockchain technology is. This learning together was an awesome and informative one.

*What can we do better next time? How can we improve our next session?*
