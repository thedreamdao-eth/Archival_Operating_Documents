## Kickoff (10 mins)

<aside>
üåû What was the single most powerful quote or idea from the piece and why?

**Put your name down.**

</aside>

- ‚ÄúDecentralized systems make it harder, but not impossible, for history to repeat itself. We might once again live in indentured servitude to the very same Web3 tools we created for our liberation‚Äù - Allison Su
- ‚ÄúWeb3 has a significant branding and design problem.‚Äù - Charlotte Bruderly
- ‚Äú**Web3 should speak plainly.**‚Äù ****It took me months to find out what the f*** a blockchain was... web3 should really start branding or at least naming their systems to more everyday human terminology. There's a huge barrier to entering the space because it simply isn‚Äôt easy to understand the terminology. - Dariel
- ‚ÄúPerhaps more so than developers and engineers, Web3 needs communicators, user experience researchers, and interface designers: people skilled at simplifying, not adding complexity.‚Äù Really enjoyed this quote - Oliver
- Not a specific quote, but I liked the focus on the ‚Äúlate adopter.‚Äù There is so much power in web3‚Äôs potential to reward all of us - and the notion of a ‚Äúpyramid scheme‚Äù should not be right in a functioning web3 environment. We should embrace late adopters! - Tom
- The beauty of Web3 is that its network value increases as its utility to more people grows. The broader its applications, the greater the benefit to us all. - Joshua

- ‚ÄúA major challenge to wider adoption of Web3 is that the gap between participants and laggards is already so vast as to appear nearly unbridgeable. The abundance of jargon and the requirement for technical sophistication make adoption feel prohibitive.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúInnovations come, promise a lot, become corrupt, and go‚Äù - Tim

- ‚ÄúDiscord servers need community managers and evangelists to welcome, guide, and engage.‚Äù ‚Äî Ethan
- ‚ÄúEvery protocol and community, from NFTs to DAOs, desperately needs onramping guides and how-to manuals.‚Äù Lucy

## Reflections and Takeaways (10 mins)

***Tim***

- New experience - trying to drive a conversation at same time - not easy!
- Great convo and contribution by Builders and Champs

***Jae-Hee + Ethan***

- Ethan: +1 on new experience - quote from Anastasia: importance of diverse perspectives for web3 ecosystem
- Jae-Hee: Saf brought a great question about lack of compelling narrative around web3; global south could particularly benefit; charlotte + emmani had great point

***What is one thing you learned from this conversation? What were particularly thought-provoking questions brought up? Any new questions did you develop during this session?***

- Ethan: Idea of owning things in web3; we pay gas because we have agency
- Gary: Web3 can make the most impact in areas with little existing tech infrastructure
- Tim: web3 could lay a new foundation for the web, it‚Äôs also important to keep up with developments
- Madison: It was interesting how web3 makes us think ab ownership
- Anastasia: actively reflecting - changing perspectives as listening to the discussion; think about implicit power dynamics of thinking you‚Äôre a ‚Äúlearner‚Äù and not agent shaping web3; **be a participatory designer - you have the power + responsibility to teach the ‚Äúweb3 OGs‚Äù -** you need to speak to your needs and experiences; unless they hear from you, they will only have so wide of a design philosophy
- Oliver: New question from the discussion, how can we build partnerships with communities and people (beyond organizations and existing structures) in regard to web3
- Dariel: The concepts and certain phrases were hard to comprehence, but that ties with the topic.

***What can we do better next time? How can we improve our next Dream DAO Explorer session?*** 

- Tim: Liked the decentralized approach
- Gary: it didn‚Äôt feel as crowded as the last one
- Ethan: We coul‚Äôve make guidelines for convos to make them more organized
- Madison: It would be a good experience to try smaller groups, bc it‚Äôs more difficult to talk in front of 18 people. It might add more value to convos + deeper exploration of topics
- Gary: We can try smaller (10-12) groupd next time
- Lucy - likes the format over treks because it enables people to hang back and just listen
- Gary: 3-4 volunteers from different groups to distill info
