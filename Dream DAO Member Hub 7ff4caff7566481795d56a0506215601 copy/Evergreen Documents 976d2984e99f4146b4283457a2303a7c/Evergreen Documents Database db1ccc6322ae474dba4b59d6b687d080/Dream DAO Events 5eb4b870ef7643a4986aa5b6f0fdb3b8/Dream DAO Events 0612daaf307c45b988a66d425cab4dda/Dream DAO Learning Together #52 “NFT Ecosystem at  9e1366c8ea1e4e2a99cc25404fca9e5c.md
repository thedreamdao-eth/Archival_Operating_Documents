## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by <Fernando Cruz>

- Mashiat work for Celo, a community that has for mission to build a financial system that creates the condition for everyone¬¥s prosperity.
- Celo as a community offers an infrastructure for a leading Refi ecosystem.
- Celo¬¥s vision is focused on growing and robust the ting ReFi NFT ecosystem to create equitable and accessible systems for creators and builders around the world to take ownership of t own financial prosperity.
- For Celo, Regenerative Finance (ReFi) is a movement where mission-driven communities empowered by blockchain technology have the potential to address climate change, and biodiversity loss and to redefine underlying social structures into systems that promote equitable access to resources for How which Celo NFT Ecosystem supports ReFi is by:
- The way in which Celo NFT Ecosystem supports ReFi is by:
1. Generating sustainable and equitable value for creators, builders, and users around the world.
2. Helping aligned creators drive new utilities that resonate with their communities or needs.
3. Empowering individuals to take collective action towards regenerating the Earth¬¥s capital.
- Celo has an NFT Resource Hub that mission-alignedigned projects, creators, and builders to mobile-optimizedmized NFT solutions for the 6B+ smartphone users around the world. (This project is powered by TATUM)
- Celo has around 16 projects for builders, devel, opers, and creators to help and achieve the previous objectives.
- Also, Celo recognized that some key challenges persist in the transition, some of them are:
1. ReFi: There is a demand for natural capital-backed assets, the thing here is how you can create and verify a supply. Also, liquidity can be a struggle for chains and can be a challenge. Finally, another challenge that persists in ReFi is the fact that exists high compliance and barriers entering to ReFi projects. 
2. NFTs: In the case of NFTs, one challenge is the survivability for small creators, because is compared this survivability to commercially hyped projects. Also, some other challenges in NFTs are the Centralized Marketplaces and Security concerns, the no redeemable utility, and the siloed communities.
3. Emerging Markets: The low connectivity in remote areas is the principal challenge for emerging markets, also some other challenges are the offramp integration and pathways, the onboarding and abstraction of the emerging markets, and the cultural behaviors around money.
- Finally, Celo has some objectives to get innovation on the horizon, some of them are:
1. No code pathway for creators of any background to launch their collection.
2. Innovative Infrastructure: Dynamic NFTs, SBTs, Componsable SVGs.
3. Undercollateralized DeFi Lending for Creators.
4. Land and Biodiversity Conservation NFTs.
5. NFTs as Education or Healthcare Certificates for children in emerging markers.
6. Semi-fungible NFT pathways for creators to add more utility to understanding communities.
