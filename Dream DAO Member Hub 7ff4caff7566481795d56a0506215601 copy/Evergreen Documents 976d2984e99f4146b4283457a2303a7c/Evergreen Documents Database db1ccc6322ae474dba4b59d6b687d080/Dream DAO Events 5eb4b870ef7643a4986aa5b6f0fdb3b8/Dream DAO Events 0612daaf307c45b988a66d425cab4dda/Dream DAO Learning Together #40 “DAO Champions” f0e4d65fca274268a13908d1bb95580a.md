## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Charlotte

- Saf started as an engineer.  He realized he didn’t like engineering and began working on career development for engineering students (which he only left completely three weeks ago!).  Over COVID, he became interested in web3.  Although he originally approached web3 from a degen perspective, he quickly explored regen and social impact.  He started in Bankless DAO and joined as a writer.  He enjoyed writing but wanted to do more for a larger impact, which led him to Protein and the Dream DAO.
    - Charlotte: What were your career transitions like?  What did you have to do to adjust?
        - Saf: The first career change was the most difficult; it felt like I was leaving engineering behind for good.  My parents weren’t happy, and I had to take a pay cut.  It was a tough initial transition, but I realized that I enjoyed my life a lot more with my new work.  (My parents saw that too, and they became supportive of it.)  That first transition - and realizing it’s not a big deal - was really encouraging in putting myself out there for web3.  It’s getting easier and easier each time.  It’s sometimes hard for generalists like me, but if you are self-directed, you can find new things.
- Anastasia has always been interested in identifying the ways we can increase human thriving or decrease human suffering.  She started in politics, but she realized that that was often small-scale change.  Media has more potential.  She worked with NBC, podcasting.  But, again, she wanted to have more of an impact.  She then went to Africa and helped focus on global public health.  She worked as Communications Director at a Rwandan university and also started a company connecting job seekers to employment in East Africa.  She realized that she had to go home, so she looked for the highest leverage point in the US - tech.  After the Cambridge Analytica scandal, she worked in consumer tech and privacy.  To get there, she worked with the committee that wrote the report for the Senate on Russia’s influence on the 2016 election (New Knowledge).  In 2020, she decided to go to graduate school… and figured out nothing to solve consumer privacy issues.  Last summer, in a fit of frustration, she tried to isolate the variables that produce surveillance capitalism, and she kept going back to identity.  We don’t own our own identities - there’s always an inherent power dynamic with companies.  In order to explore this, she got into crypto.  (At one point, she also worked with NPR.)
    - Oliver: I’m registering for college classes right now, and I’m trying to focus really intently on the things that interest me.  Your experiences reassure me.
    - Saf: With all your work, do you feel like you were fine-tuning your interests?  Are you closer to your “you-shaped hole”?
        - I’m happy with what I have now - I’ve found my life purpose.  However, I couldn’t be in this lane without being exposed to all the other things I’ve done.  In tech, for example, you only build for one type of client or one group.  However, the tools that we build have impacts.  We don’t have the social technologies to think about these.  Had I just done tech, I wouldn’t have had exposure to new ideas and empathetic ideas.
- Julia was pre-law.  She started off in local politics in NYC and worked with a progressive group as well as a civic nonprofit.  In college, she joined a club that fed into venture capital.  She decided she wanted to work in tech or in tech-law and interned at a venture capital organization.  After that, she started a job on campus at the Media Lab.  She worked with design students and aided them with tech tools (Adobe, etc.).  Over winter break, she found the NEAR whitepapers and realized that web3 was discussing the tech/social issues she was interested in.  She joined the Dream DAO, did product marketing for Gitcoin, and became a media strategist for Forefront.  She is exploring her possible career paths.
    - Anastasia: What brings you joy?
        - I’m doing product marketing right now, but I don’t think it’s what I want to do.  I’m not ruling out design (or law).  I’m not sure right now.
    - Saf: It sounds like you’ve been able to find work for causes and organizations you believe in.  What are the main skills you’ve found to be helpful when putting yourself out there/reaching out?
        - I’ve gotten really good at teaching myself things - that’s how I’m able to do so many different roles.  Being in New York helps because I’ve been to a lot of networking events.  I’ve also been told I have a strong personality… I might get things through sheer force of personality?  Also, I don’t switch my personality with different groups.  I’m the same person for everyone.
- Carl grew up in a family where all the males were mathematicians.  There was pressure for him to get into math, but he was also concerned with the applications of such research and work.  In college, he started with computer science but realized it wasn’t what he wanted to do.  He studied abroad in Tanzania.  He worked in a remote village and collected land-use data.  He raised some grants, and he later went back to East Africa.  However, he was disillusioned with his work and began micro-financing.  Carl then worked with TechnoServe for development work.  He ended up in Rwanda and Ethiopia.  Eventually, he got an MBA and began a start-up (coffee sustainability) with a web2 model.  That was going well, but COVID hit.  Carl realized he had different values from his friend and looked for other spaces.  With a writing course, he found crypto and web3.  The environment was encouraging, and he loved people’s desires to solve things.  He’s been getting more and more involved - with Dream DAO, with Gitcoin, etc.
    - Saf: What would past Carl think about current Carl?
        - I think he would be psyched about how it’s turned out.  There are things you discover early on but don’t have an opportunity to pursue, but when you do get to do them, it’s very affirming.
