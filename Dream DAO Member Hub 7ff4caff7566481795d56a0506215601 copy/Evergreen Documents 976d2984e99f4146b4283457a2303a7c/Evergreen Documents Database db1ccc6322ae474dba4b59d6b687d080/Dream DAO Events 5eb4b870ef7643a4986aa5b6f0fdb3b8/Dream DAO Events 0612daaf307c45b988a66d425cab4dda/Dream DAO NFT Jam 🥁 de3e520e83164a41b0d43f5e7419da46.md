## Provocation/Question: How much are we asking for?

- We are raising money for the Accelerator Program Fund
    - The money we are raising from this v2 collection is going to a pot of funds that will at some point help a proven young web3 builder be in web3 full time for a year - it won‚Äôt be distributed all at once.
- If it‚Äôs the Accelerator Program, we can easily say...
    - We have 25 amazing kids
    - 12000 to cover the Accelerator Program

## Provocation/Question: What are the goals of this?

- Gary:
    - Top priority: raise more money
        - Madison: ... for the Accelerator Program?
            - Gary: Yes - this makes sense. We also want to prove to ourselves that people think the program is worth building.
    - Secondary priority: onboard amazing new champions

## Provocation/Question: What are the benefits of holding a SkywalkerZ?

- Learning Together access
- Access to a bunch of community Discord channels
- Ability to join our Intros club (this would be new)
- Opportunity to apply to become a Champion

## Provocation/Question: What is this drop in relation to new Champion onboarding?

- We set expectations that this drop is to join as a member of the Dream DAO and support it financially.
- We will be clear that as it relates to becoming a Dreamer (voting + core contributor type role), we‚Äôre only going to onboarding a couple dozen new Champions in the coming months.

## Provocation/Question: Price of NFTs?

- Gary: I think .1 ETH continues to be a good price, because it shows that you significantly believe in Dream DAO but don‚Äôt have to be super rich.
    - If anything, it could be less than .1, but we don‚Äôt want OG buyers to feel like they got a worse deal
    - and we don‚Äôt want people to think that we are creating a less valuable drop.

## Provocation/Question: How many released? And is there time scarcity?

- Gary: Not sure, but let‚Äôs throw out the number 500 (purchaseable). And we can say that minting closes within a week or two.
    - Overall, I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs a big deal if we don‚Äôt sell out
- **Madison: What if there isn‚Äôt a cap on the number released, but it‚Äôs purely time scarcity?!**
    - Gary: this makes sense!

## Provocation/Question: Are we using the same NFT contract + art?

- Gary: I‚Äôm leaning to yes. That‚Äôs the easiest.

## Provocation/Question: Who should we talk to before launching this? (partners and whatnot)

- Gary:
    - I‚Äôm going to catch up with Crypto Coral Tribe about marketing
- Madison: We need to create a promo kit for the new collection.
    
    

## Provocation/Question: When is this going to be launched? What are other key dates?

- Gary:
    - Depends on what I hear from the Coinbase NFT folks, who are interested in helping us promote this.
    - Just so we have time to plan this release, and so that our Explorers Program host sites have time to fall in love with our Builders, maybe it should be launched in mid-late June or first week of July.
    

## Reflections and Takeaways (10 mins)

*What is one thing you learned from this conversation? What new questions did you develop during this session?*

- Madhav: Keep asking good questions
    - Gary: Good job, Madhav!
- Madison:
    - One-pager followups after jams is amazing!
    - 3 people take on a task ‚Üí create one-pager ‚Üí lots of people leave feedback (great system!)
- Gary:
    - Smaller jams can be very efficient and helpful

*What can we do better next time? How can we improve our next Dream DAO Explorer session?*
