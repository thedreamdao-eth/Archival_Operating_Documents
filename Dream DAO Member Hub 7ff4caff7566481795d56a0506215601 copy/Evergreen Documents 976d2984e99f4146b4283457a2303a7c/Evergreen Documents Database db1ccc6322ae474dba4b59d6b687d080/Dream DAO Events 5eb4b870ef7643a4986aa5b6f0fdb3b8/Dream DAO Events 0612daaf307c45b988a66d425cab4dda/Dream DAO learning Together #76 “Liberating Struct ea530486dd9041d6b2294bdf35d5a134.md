## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by <>

- Jeremy can be found with @gospelofchange
- Bruno at @BrunoRoemers
- Bruno is trying to bridge the gap between DAOs and co-ops in his new personal venture
- Jeremy‚Äôs thought: You are possessed by an ancient spirit who has many names: Loki, Trickster God etc.‚Ä¶, what would the trickster god make you do to produce the absolute worst communication and collaboration and coordination?
    - Divided into breakout rooms for paired discussions
    - Lexical Ambiguities (especially in different languages)
    - Buzzword salads and constantly feeling the need to fill silences without contributing meaningfully
    - Goldilocks Zone for communication ‚Üí how many people is ideal for effective communication?
    - Language barriers and communication style differences (e.g. British humor, difference between what you‚Äôre saying and what you mean (explicit vs implicit))
    - Adding punishment/negative effects for communication and collaboration (especially if its implicit)
    - no matter what other people say, react agitated
    - Silence on chats
    - Shutting down ideas, being egoistic
    - Jeremy brings up how being broken into 1:1 groups forced important, topic focused communication that is meaningful which was not seen in the larger but still relatively small meeting room initially. And when we rejoined the group, we shared discussions and insights. We can take away that 1:1 interactions create safety, opportunity/open invitation to share, relate ideas, and causes more than 1 person to have that information who can bring that point of view forward in the main group (good for introverted individuals)
- Gospel of Change is an association built upon the idea that young people care and there is a feeling or burden related to ‚Äòwe must‚Äô do something to solve the everything crisis: education, politics, economy, climate and environment, the ‚Äòmeaning crisis‚Äô etc..
    - Jeremy suggests that small discussion groups bring forth small progress that leads to incremental change that will lead to more progress than being weighed down and overwhelmed by the ‚Äòwe must solve everything‚Äô mindset
- Personal transformation is individual, can be done by anybody, without need for larger action, it expands a little for interpersonal transformation and improvement, but for system hierarchy transformations, it becomes very tricky to do anything of meaning, e.g. creating new, strict laws to outlaw something that‚Äôs bad completely, which leads to second-order or exponential consequences making it almost impossible
    - Using liberating structures, and using the inter-personal liberating structures method (intended for 1-12 people) will help start the process of change. It requires only 1 person to start an interaction for value to be added, whereas in a larger, convoluted system, it‚Äôs actually harder to get started and make meaningful progress.
    - Stacking together like 4 liberating structures >>> meeting of 48 people
    - Institutions are built to resist change and transformation, and liberating structures are made to break down those barriers, try new things (weird things), challenge the status quo
    - Essence of the problem is social
    - Brains are super expensive, 2% of body weight but 20% of body weight is used by them, they are the biggest payroll expense for the human body, so they must be used effectively! Bringing us the bandwidth vs throughput challenge
    - Current meeting structures are presentations: 1 person talks, others listen, but couldn‚Äôt that just be an email, status updates: mini updates from everyone, managed discussion: 1 person demands answers, others try to answer, blame others, avoid, or get reprimanded; and then brainstorming sessions where people of authority are praised for ideas that might be bad; free for all: the loudest get heard, noise is heard, signal is ignored!
    - 10 principles of liberating structures:

    - Interaction Patterns of Liberating Structures:

    - Liberating structures also focus on the questions we ask, which steer communication in different directions

    - We used TRIZ in this session: Loki question and discussion
    - Liberating structures will make us better leaders and communicators, because all leadership will be centered around that in the near future (with AI)
    - Eco cycle: a way to not down and grow our ideas in a loop structure

    - helps grow or kill ideas, encourages different voices to be heard and the best ones to be chosen, not the loudest ones or the ones proposed by the ones with authority
- Panarchy: top down visualization method

- I would recommend going through the recording of the LT, the hosts went very fast through a lot of very fascinating topics, and it wasn‚Äôt a lecture more of a guided discussion, and to truly absorb all of it, you should watch the recordings with a lot of pauses and reflection sessions.

## Discussion (20 mins)

Harry: Not knowing enough, having self-doubts can prevent liberation

Jeremy: The wise crowd method is good for that: crowd asks questions, gauges the level of knowledge/understands something, presents their own thoughts, ideas or explanations, and then the speaker can re-begin

Jeremy and Harry: perceived authority dynamics, and information inferiority dynamics ‚Üí self-doubt, lack of confidence, not turning on mic and camera, not putting our hands up. Making people comfortable is key here, for getting value on both sides, most of the time it is confidence and not power dynamics. Remote environments like DreamDAO make it a little more challenging.

E.g. Not many DAO members join calls and LTs

Suggestion: pre-communication and providing additional information like ‚Äòso what‚Äô ‚Üí what will joining this session do for you, help you, what will be the second-order consequences. Instead of saying its a liberating structures session, tell us that its a session about liberating structures, a method of transforming interpersonal communication to bring forth system hierarchal change and large scale social impact which will be key to the future of leadership, this would garner a lot more attendees.

Jeremy: Design brief ‚Üí knowing the purpose, intended outcomes, context, types of participants, time limit, set list/agenda and communicating that is key for effective communication, e.g. we will do x, y, z and then discuss a, b, c with the aim of solidifying 1, 2, and 3! Detailed agendas are key.

Liberating structure: Heard, Seen, and Respected ‚Üí invites everyone to tell a story about a time when they were not heard, seen, or respected, and it brings forth a culture of inclusivity and open communication ground because it tells everyone that everyone has felt that way.

Appreciative Interviews ‚Üí Using past experiences where things went wrong to guide the new experiences in the right direction

1, 2, 4, all ‚Üí invites everyone to think privately, in increasingly larger groups, and then collectively

Impromptu networking ‚Üí 3 different one on one interactions

Conversation Cafe ‚Üí circle based discussions on insights and personal reflections, one by one and then an open space for 10 mins, and another one by one to share an end synthesis and outcome (sets the vibes)

## Reflections and Takeaways (10 mins)

*What is one thing you learned from this lecture + conversation? What new questions did you develop during this session?*

Harry: Realized how the DAO changed when it was just interesting projects, and now with money involved, is it the only value proposition as people often sign up for bounties but dont show up when they dont get it, showing they have time but didnt find it worth it, i.e. POAPs, the knowledge, the incentive of internship opportunities isn‚Äôt enough ‚Üí maybe it‚Äôs a communication problem

Jeremy‚Äôs Advice for that ‚Üí try the What I need from you liberation structure ‚Üí sharing mutual expectations, incentives, responding to their expectations with how, next steps, implementation ideas, this is crucial for engagement.

*What can we do better next time? How can we improve our next session?* 

- improvements on DAO LT sessions were suggested in the discussion session, attaching snippet here:
