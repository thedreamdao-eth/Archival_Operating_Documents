## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Arath amanda, rip Charlotte 😔 amanda fix grammar later

- Gnomadiclifedao is a DAO whose goal is to end homelessness. People will have a place to live + food in exchange of 40 hours of work (domes).
- Build domes for free in other communities, plus give them resources to keep running these domes in different places. Use money to buy kits to create the domes.
