## Provocation/Question: Can Gary talk more about what regeneration means?

- Short answer: yes! it’s his favorite thing to do - ash
- Gary: Decentralized and autonomous feel far off, but they’re great goals and provocations.
- G: The price of adopting the term “DAO” means you have to constantly consider its meaning.
- G: Regeneration means improving others’ lives in meaningful ways, not just working on qualities like decentralization.
- G: Regeneration means improving yourself and the communities, ecosystems, and bureaucratic systems around you. It’s an aspiration motivation to build anew!
- Jae-Hee: This is a curve of a few decades - is that the scale of what we see here?
    - David: Yes!
    - Jae-Hee: The rate of change is exponential - what’s the cost? How can we cope with people’s inclination to centralize? This uplifts tech-savvy people, but not everyone is like that. How can we make the regeneration and building inclusive?
    - David: How do we control for helping our kids’ mental health and the use of social media when our government isn’t giving people the skills to evolve?
    - David: Most people jump at headlines at don’t look at the details.
- Carl: There’s a spectrum of everything. This applies to the term regen, too!
- Carl: The more these systems are shared, the bigger impact there is in the world. People are beginning to approach everything differently because of the impacts of web3, no matter where the tech ends up.
- David: Web3 is about empowering ourselves and each other, not paying people in crypto.
    - David: We should all vote via Snapshot! Feels like we’re taking back control of what voting means.
- David is learning too! Gary’s putting lots of hype in the chat for David using the term “regenerative” more
- David: Web3 was initially the regenerate our financial system, but its impact is spreading. This is a great evolution and has the capacity to make a much bigger impact.
- David: The goal of building the internet was to increase freedom and ownership, especially as it pertains to socialization. Then it pivoted to creation, now it’s pivoting to control of evolving systems around you.
- Jae-Hee: While web3 increases accessibility (”flattens the world”) we are still bound to a place and time.
- David: Social networks made the world a less lonelier place (”scalable intimacy”) - great ideas and intent behind social networks are hitting challenges because of advertising and media.
    - Less FOMO pre-network, but greater capacity to engage and support others now.
    - Jae-Hee: For younger users, this isn’t the case.
    - David: Doesn’t come with a user manual or controls. Parents don’t have knowledge to control it, needs more constraints. Hopefully web3 has this!
    - David: Web3 feels big because we’re living in it, but folks can struggle to understand it. It’s a small ecosystem.
    - Jae-Hee: People to struggle to
    - David: Web began with more of a pure intention to learn but with every iterative cycle, there are more opportunists and opportunism, especially in the crypto/NFT space.

## Provocation/Question: How do companies’ web3 transitions play out?

- Carl: Are companies moving into web3 effectively or taking a half step? Are web3 companies moving towards web2?
- David: Companies like Twitter are learning to jump to the “next generation” / web3, just like Microsoft did with browsers
    - Other companies may take a long time because they’re based on centralization and ownership
    - Companies like Coinbase are trying to be THE major player in the industry, kills the web3 spirit
