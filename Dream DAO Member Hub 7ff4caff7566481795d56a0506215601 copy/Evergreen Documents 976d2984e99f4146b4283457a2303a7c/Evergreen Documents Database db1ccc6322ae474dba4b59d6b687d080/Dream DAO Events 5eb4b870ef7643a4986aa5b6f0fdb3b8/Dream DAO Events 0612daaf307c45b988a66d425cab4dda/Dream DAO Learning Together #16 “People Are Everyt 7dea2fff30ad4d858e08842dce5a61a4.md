## Gary‚Äôs Insights:

- You don‚Äôt have time to work with everyone, so be picky with the projects, people, and internships that you work on in web3
- Vibing with people is so important
- Wayback machine is a public good https://web.archive.org/
- Military kids are most likely to seek out interesting digital experiences like CU (backbone of CU)
- This current decade is unlike any other (so much potential for innovation)
- It‚Äôs highly recommended to interact more on Twitter (especially for Community members)

## Julie O‚Äôs Insights:

- A sense of civicism/civic innovation can change the world
- We should pay more attention to conversations about web3 in order to participate in conversations around safety
- Be more in contact with the next generation in order to build meaningful bridges
- First impressions of web3: Not skeptic and more curious. There are some forms of elitism that exists in web3.
- Foster a mindset of community
- Normalize the web3 space
- How can we expand the conversations and information about web3 and decentralization beyond the United States?
- We shouldn‚Äôt underestimate those who create under scarcity
- How can we build spaces that don‚Äôt just work in places that have high speed internet?
- Decentralization isn‚Äôt the solution to everything, but we should make sure that we make these spaces open to everyone if we‚Äôre truly interested in making this a reality
- Recommended book: System Error
- Learn from the failures of web2 (ex: Libertarian thinking) in order to make web3 better
