## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Aryan Tiwari

- We can use blockchain or web3 technology to create social impact.
- Intro to blockchain (Tweet by [cdixon.eth](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1459036992050716697?lang=en))
    - Web 1 - Read. (The basic internet - think Wikipedia)
    - Web 2 - Read, Write. (The web we use now like social media)
    - Web 3 - Read, Write, Own.
    
    The blockchain is a network of computers that stores a series of block (contains data and a hash from the previous block. for eg, in bitcoin the block data is a list of transactions). The hash function changes if the data of the block changes. This is what makes the blockchain secure by storing the hash of each block.
    
- Consensus Mechanisms
    - Proof of Work - each computer solves a really complex maths problem to find the hash for a block. The miner gets a reward. Most secure but energy-intensive and not scalable. (Example - Bitcoin)
    - Proof of Stake - solves the scalability and energy usage problem. People, called validators, stake money in the blockchain and on the basis of the amount of money staked they are selected to mine a block. (Ethereum will become PoS after [The Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/))
    
    Smart Contracts are self-executing contracts. This helps to get rid of the middle-man which is handled by code. They can be deleted but they are immutable and interactions with them are irreversible.
    
- Layer 1 vs Layer 2
    
    Layer 1 example - Ethereum, Cardano, Solana. This is the main chain that the application runs on. They might not be super scalable, and can have higher gas fee like Ethereum. Focuses on security rather than application
    
    A Layer 2 example from Ethereum is polygon. Much more scalable and lower gas fee.
    
- Key properties for Social Impact:
    - Decentralised - no centralized decision making body
    - Trustless - no need for middlemen and rent-seeking
    - Transparent - everything is recorded, public and immutable
    - Permissionless - anyone can participate.
    - Interoperable - blockchains are typically built to interoperate with each other.
    - Composable - applications can build on top of each other like lego-blocks
    
    A real example of an application that uses the key properties is Etherisc - a decentralised insurance protocol. It‚Äôs open source and thus, not expensive. All the key properties apply to Etherisc.
    
- Three main types of Web3 projects
    - NFTs - Non-Fungible Tokens. It can represent any unique asset like a real-life car, some piece of land (like a chunk of the amazon rainforest, see Moss.earth), music, art..
    - DAOs - Decentralised Autonomous Organisations. They allow members to have voting rights. Transparent version of a ‚Äúdigital co-op‚Äù Example - Dream DAO, Klima DAO
    - De-Fi - Removes control of banks from money. Money has been very centrally controlled by institutions. De-Fi might not be needed in places with secure and strong institutions like the US. But in countries like Turkey, where people cannot rely on the government to safe-keep money, De-Fi are a real use case. They can be used by anyone with access to the internet. Funds can be transferred in seconds or minutes.
    
- Improving Existing Institutions using Crypto
    - Let‚Äôs take the example of the US Paycheck Protection Program. Meant to help small businesses. The government resisted transparency and people weren‚Äôt getting money. When the data was released, it was found out that the money was going to larger organisations related to the President, Kanye West‚Ä¶ This is where Crypto can bring in more transparency of the flow of funds. Also, smart contracts can be used to verify the eligibility of an organisation to receive funding.
    - ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt do evil is always better than don‚Äôt do evil. Having a position of power can bring about vulnerability to exploit that power. So, crypto/smart contracts can be used.
    
- Presentations by builders!
    - Julieta presented a case on Coral Tribe - A collection of 6565 NFTs reviving the wild
        
        It‚Äôs a community that leverages art and NFTs to revive the ocean life. The community has been restoring coral fields. This can have a tremendous impact as it‚Äôs ‚Äúa vehicle for change powered by you‚Äù
        
    - Jaynie presented a case on Amply - An organisation using blockchain for education.
        
        It helps the whole process of attendance for pre-school children in South Africa. Everything is done through paper in SA which has little trust. A lot of money was mis-directed and did not go to the children and their development. Amply uses Tokenized payments to distribute the money which increases trust and impact. This has helped the government and organizations understand how effective this program is and how much impact it has on child development.
        
    - Ibtehaj presented a case on Cowgirl DAO - uses NFTs to
        
        The Computer Cowgirls NFTs were used to fund an Austin based organisation. After Roe vs Wade, Dixon and a few partners formed the Cowgirl DAO and made a new set of NFTs
        
    
- This slide can be used to judge whether a project uses all the key properties of Web3 [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DKOozs8pTXjWw7PbkyEOeQ7ZAv42wQgRR0TqjR5rpfs/edit](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DKOozs8pTXjWw7PbkyEOeQ7ZAv42wQgRR0TqjR5rpfs/edit)

## Provocation/Question:

- Prabhat: Are there any cons of L2 chains? - They cannot be used on their own. They are dependent on L1 chains to make transactions.
