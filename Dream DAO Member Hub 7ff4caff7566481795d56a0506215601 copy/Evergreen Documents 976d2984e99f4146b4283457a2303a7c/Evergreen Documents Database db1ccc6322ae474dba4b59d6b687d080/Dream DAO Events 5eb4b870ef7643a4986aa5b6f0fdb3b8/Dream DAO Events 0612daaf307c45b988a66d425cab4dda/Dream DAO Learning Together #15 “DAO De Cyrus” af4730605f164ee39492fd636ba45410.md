## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Charlotte

- Professional experiences:
    - Started learning how to program at age thirteen and improved as he went
    - Worked at a startup in software development and took a gap year to continue work
    - Studied at the University of Waterloo while working on side projects
        - A person’s 9-5 isn’t what defines them
    - Founded a startup for Linkedin automation
        - Didn’t find meaning in the work
- Spiritual journey:
    - Inflective point in life about three years ago
    - Values and virtues are high level ideas that can’t be attained but can always be sought
        - Have things you aspire to be
        - Boil your ideas down into things you can tangibly do in your life
            - Create your life
- **5 levels**
    - Everyday, thought-based, thinking, small mind
    - “Subtle” mind, body
        - Step up and watch your thoughts (”I’m noticing I’m anxious”)
        - Step into your body (feel your physical self [running, for example])
    - Effortless awake awareness
        - Seeing the whole frame
    - Next... simultaneous mind and true nature
- Surrender from doing to being - submit to the forces of the universe (cosmic consciousness)
- People who truly believe in something put in energy when others aren’t doing the same.  There’s a point where things can become self-sustaining, but it requires a lot of energy consistently.
- Music is one of my favorite ways to connect with the different cultures of the world.  Instrumental music also gives people more room for interpretation.

## Provocation/Question: Do you think we can communicate these virtues of spirituality through not only talking through words, but channeling them through our own behaviors so people are influenced by them indirectly (like modelling positive behaviors and attitudes)? What are some parts of you want other people to learn from you?

- Cyrus: We have created an approachable space at the Eden DAO.  We can also model behaviors by carefully creating something.  (For example, a heartfelt, handmade birthday card is much better than a store-bought one.)  Showing people you care in an act of concentrated love is important.  It makes things better.
- Be what you want to see in the world, and write an agreement on how people in your space will be in the world.  “Community covenant.”
- What to take away?  Lead with love.  Be selfless.  Take cold showers.

## Provocation/Question: How do we make spirituality more approachable?

- Cyrus: I gave an example once of a time I was sad and didn’t let it overwhelm me.  Show thought process.
- Using examples is a really approachable way for people to get involved.

## Provocation/Question: How do you institutionalize or externalize the idea of spirituality?

- Cyrus: We want to experiment with the creation of a manifesto.  If you are trying to join a community, a ritual is a very powerful thing.  If there can be an agreement for joining, that sets the tone and expectations properly.
- Start with why.
- Create habits along the way to integrate beliefs.

## Provocation/Question: How do you sustain momentum in a spiritual community?

- Cryus: People are voluntary contributors.  To sustain that, a mesh of connection that isn’t related to work needs to be created.
- Build trust with social events, icebreakers, one-on-ones, etc.

## Provocation/Question: How do we make sure not to burn out and keep the ideals of DAOs?

- Cyrus: For a lot of people, this is a foreign approach.  They are used to being told what to do.
- We are the stewards of a decentralized group.  We are contributors to a broader goal.  Centralization is okay, but it can’t be the centralization of the DAO.  It has to be centralization of effort only.

## Provocation/Question: How have you learned about the practices and cultures that you use in spirituality?

- Cyrus: Western religion and Eastern spirituality are fingers pointing at the same moon.
- I don’t like the idea that there is a specific belief that is “right.”  I’ve tried to find a common ground.
- There’s a sense of peace that I appreciate in religions and cultures.

## Provocation/Question: How has the DAO world influenced your introspection?

- Cyrus: We have within us everything already.  It’s the idea that we aren’t missing anything; we just need to find internally what we can express externally
- Cyrus: I’ve gotten more into Daoism.  I see what forces are present.  It’s less about changing what’s out there and more about understanding deeply.
