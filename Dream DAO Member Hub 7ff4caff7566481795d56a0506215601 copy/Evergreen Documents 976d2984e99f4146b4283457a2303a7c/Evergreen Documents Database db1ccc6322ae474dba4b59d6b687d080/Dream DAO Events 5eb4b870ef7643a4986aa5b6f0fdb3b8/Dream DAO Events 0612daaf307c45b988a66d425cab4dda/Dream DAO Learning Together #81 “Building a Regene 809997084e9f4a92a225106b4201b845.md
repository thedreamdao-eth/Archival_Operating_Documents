### Celo Blockchain Overview

> *The Celo blockchain was built ground up for regenerative economic systems*
> 

**Solving real world problems begins with the technology stack**

**Utility NFTs: Launch a no-code NFT collection that‚Äôs good for the planet**

**Humanitarian Aid: Deliver aid more efficiently and transparently to those in need**

**Lending: Leverage DeFi to provide loans to the financially excluded**

**Customer Loyalty: Launch a future-proof, world class loyalty program for positive behavior**

**Climate Finance: Transparency and financing for renewable projects such as tokenized carbon credits and project finance.**

**Payments:** Fast Cross-border payments with low fees (less than $0.01)

### Building the ReFi ecosystem

1. Enable new models for shared prosperity: Tackle mass coordination problems (e.g. climate action or poverty alleviation) by reducing frictions, aligning incentives to reward positive externalities, and punishing negative externalities
2. Create a more more transparent voluntary carbon market: The climate crisis requires large capital flows that finance carbon dioxide removal and enable companies and people to decarbonize their footprint‚Äîwith assurances of quality and efficacy
3. Reward planet positive behavior and foster narrative change: NFTs function as a way to build and galvanize community towards climate action‚Äîthrough awareness, narrative change, and funding
4. Enable a new avenue to access capital: Democratize access to capital for underserved communities and reduce costs for businesses, fostering economic inclusion and capital flows to areas with limited access to global capital
