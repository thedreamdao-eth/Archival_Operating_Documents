# Breakout #2

Note taker(s): Jae-Hee + Ethan

**We need people with soft skills in communication, design, education, and community building to onboard users and facilitate wider, faster, more inclusive Web3 adoption.**

- **Emmani:** Celebration of differences, backgrounds, personalities, etc.
- **Thessy:** Not easy to celebrate when everyone’s different. Point of alignment? Consider it as a challenge and welcome it. It’s not easy in the beginning when you have such a diverse crowd.
- **Ethan:** There was so much communication necessary to bring in new technology. Web3 - other technologies e.g. smartphone, internet, etc. The tech is there with its capability but it’s not being tapped into due to a lack of knowledge. Communicate that potential!
- **Shaan:** A way to actually execute and bring people in and not marginalize them is where we need to think globally + act locally. That method or mindset is carried out as effective altruism. One way we can try to execute on these barriers.
- **Charlotte:** In anatomy, we often write a children’s book for some body system. You take this complicated ideas and make it something that first graders understand. It reveals your comprehension.
- **Emmani:** Sheer complexity can be confusing and daunting. From my experience, when I was first introduced to web3, I didn’t understand what is going on. Still happens. That can be a huge barrier for many despite being interested. If they aren’t given the resources, they’ll get intimidated.

**The impact that early adopters have on the ecosystem and the importance of having diverse voices? Who are the people right now? Who are we missing?**

- **Anastasia:** Interesting power dynamic of the experienced people vs. incomers in web3. Might be the other way around? Engineers and builders need other perspectives to see what they might not be consider. Without varying perspectives, you overlook key ideas and opportunities.
- **Thessy:** Benefit of participatory design. Coming from a product perspective, better products come from better systems. Network effect as well in new entrants.
- **Jae-Hee:** Privacy and security balance, skeuomorphic products.
- **Thessy:** There’s a certain purpose underlying technology. There is a trade off between the purpose of DeFi and Crypto vs. the convenience of centralized exchanges. Keep the end goal in mind
- **Anastasia:** Watch “The Social Dilemma” on Netflix! Understand the use of web3 and why it’s needed as the next step after web2. Design patterns in web2 follow convenience > privacy. Normalize responsibility despite expecting convenience. Convenience is where we give away privacy.
    - Skeuomorphism: A skeuomorph is a derivative object that retains ornamental design cues from structures that were necessary in the original.
- **Ethan:** There’s no such thing as a free lunch. Why decentralize? If you don’t know what you’re paying, you’re getting taken advantage of.

*If anyone who hasn’t contributed yet wants to speak please feel free to!

**Lack of compelling narratives in web3. Limited to NFTs, crypto, etc.** 

- **Saf:** There isn’t a lot about the implications of web3 beyond the sensationalized. Instead of just about data, there needs to be more about the story behind it.
- **Thessy:** Depends on where you are. Often it’s about optimization and capitalization. In the global south, it can be transformational in solving problems. e.g. censorship resistance, political empowerment
- **Anastasia:** We need a “why” story. What is the purpose that is driving this? When you have a strong why it drives you and gives you a reason to get over any barrier of entry. That is why our narrative needs to be centered around privacy and self-sovereignty. The divisive speech was incentivized by advertising but there was no moderation.
    - Haugen: Facebook → real-world conflict due to polarizing business model. This is all because you’re paying with your data instead of a free and open internet.
    - Gas fees are a product of bad design since it made eth more inaccessible that's why solana and L2s came along. I want to be an agent in my own governance.
- **Thessy:** Iteration is difficult. Transactions are slow. There aren’t multiple points of verification; many chains are not secure. We need to be conscious of backlash.
- **Dariel:** Are there any web3 social media platform anything of the sorts besides mirror? Not many everyday use platforms for web3. Incorporation can create the why!
    - **Shaan:** [gm.xyz](http://gm.xyz) is like Twitter and deso which was decentralized social media that is being used everyday. There may be this interesting inflection point where people migrate from twitter to these sites.
    - **Anastasia:** Skiff (like Notion) — may not be necessary to move off of web2 platforms. Our identities are not centralized and we own our own data.
