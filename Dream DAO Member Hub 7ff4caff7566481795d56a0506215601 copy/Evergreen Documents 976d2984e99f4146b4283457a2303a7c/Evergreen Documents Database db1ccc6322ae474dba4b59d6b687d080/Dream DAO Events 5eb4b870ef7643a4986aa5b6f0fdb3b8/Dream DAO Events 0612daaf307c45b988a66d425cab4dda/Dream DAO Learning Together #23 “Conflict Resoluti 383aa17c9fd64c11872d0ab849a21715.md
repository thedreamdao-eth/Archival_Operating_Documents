## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by <Aishah>

- **How did you feel in a recent conflict situation you were in?**
- Madison: the word that comes to me is paralyzed, you don't know what the right thing to be doing is, there‚Äôs a lot of things to consider
- Technoshaman: Freezing
- Oliver: Don't know how things are going to be resolved. The feeling of uncertainty
- Joshua: I would say disappointed + freezing - because it was not what I expected (I did not expect the resolution of the conflict when everything looked like it was going to be the way I thought it was going to be)
- Carl: Powerless and defeated

- Scenario: Lived in India and studied meditation, and returned to Paris.
- Placed a soft music cassette tape, a guy took out a replaced the tape with a more disco music-like tape. ( This when on back and forth) realized the guy was looking for a fight
- It was a tense situation, both moved toward each other
- Returning the attention back to himself, realized that what was happening is fascinating. What was happening in the mind became a physical reaction.
- The learning point from that conflict: The most useful thing to do when angry is to become conscious of your emotions. Pay attention to what you can learn from your feelings
- The excitement comes from knowing that I can learn and discover something about myself. That's how we can practice alchemy. The goal of increasing self-knowledge
- What if Conflict was a gift? - for development

Madison: How to approach it when your someone helping to resolve the conflict. What would you say is the approach that someone should take? 

- What is your motivation to resolve the conflict?
- You need to have a process before the conflict breaksout.
- There are many conflict resolution processes. Don‚Äôt rush into one. Try out 2-3

**The relationship council**

Every member of the tribe is trained 

Everyone agrees to play by the rules of the conflict hearing process 

1) Why do I want to have a council - what do I seek, (wrong/right?) - do you seek healing 

The healing is happening before the ceremony - The questions to ask are, am I going into the ceremony to seek healing or make it even. 

What was my fault that contributed to this situation? I**s not about self-blaming, it‚Äôs about self-knowledge.** 

Conflict healing - about self-knowledge, self absolution  ( different from conflict management/resolution) 

( Between the two, there is no need for a facilitator)  

Have a 3rd person as a fair witness - it‚Äôs there to remind the participants whether they are violating the rule of the protocols of the council 

Thessy:  likes the idea of a fair witness. Just having that person in the room changes the whole conversation. There is scientific proof around that.

Technoshaman: The third person creates a sense of safety 

Oliver: Self- conflict. The times when I learn the most is when I am most uncertain. 

1) When I feel uncertain about a situation, what I really feel is an expression of an inner conflict. Whether conscious or unconsciously I hold two different views about a situation, ( whether it's the right way of moving forward) can't decide between the two. 

Technoshaman: Ask yourself, What is the source of the conflict? What prevents me to focus and settle on a solution? 

- See the situation from a higher vantage point
- When you look back at the present moment in a couple of years from now - What will it look like
- Interview both parts of you. What is the main underlying concept that causes you for wanting to go in a certain direction?
- Only then you can find a place of common ground

Shaan: Is there conflict dissolution? 

- On the organizational level, remember that the conflict is a gift of absolution
- View it as you are learning a new insight

Self-managing Organization

- Turing tension into the source of organization development
- **the word "polycracy**" describes the same form of government, although from a slightly different premise: a polycracy is a state ruled by more than one person, as opposed to a monocracy

**Tactical meeting** 
Put the agenda - what tension they want the tactical meeting to address. 
Don‚Äôt sweep under the rug 

- Has a facilitator
- creating a system to deal with conflict
- In the tactical meeting, we don't aim to resolve the meeting, **we aim to name as many tensions as possible**

In Polycracy - is the opposite, 

- the organism only has it's individual members as sensory organs

## Provocation/Question: is conflict a legacy of "1st tier" consciousness? or something that persists at all levels of consciousness? (Carl)

[Stages of Development of Consciousness - Mari Sierra](http://www.marisierra.com/theweightofanidea/stages-of-development-of-cultural-consciousness)

- Conflict can be a legacy of consciousness if the real conflict is of Ego
- Carl: sensing thinking speaking acting from beyond a small self with increasing frequency
- Higher consciousness (2nd tier): it doesn't mean the conflict disappears. The friction may appear
- Looking at the situation through the lens through individual experience/ history and not ego
- 

## Provocation/Question: What are your suggestions on when and how to bring this to a DAO

- The principles of Vamp?
- What can you learn from the experience of the other DAOs
-
