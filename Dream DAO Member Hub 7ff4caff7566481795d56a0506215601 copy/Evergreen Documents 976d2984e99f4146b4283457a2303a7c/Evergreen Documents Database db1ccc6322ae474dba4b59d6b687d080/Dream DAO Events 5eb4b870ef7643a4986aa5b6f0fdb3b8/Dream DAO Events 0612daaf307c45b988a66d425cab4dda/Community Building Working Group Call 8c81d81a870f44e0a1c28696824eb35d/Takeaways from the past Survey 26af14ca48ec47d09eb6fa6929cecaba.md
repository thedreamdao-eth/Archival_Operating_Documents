# Takeaways from the past Survey

By Shreya and Karl

The key suggestions from the survey:

- More fun and different events (this can be done through having some more community hangouts and new events can be planned by working with the Community Building WG)
    - Townhalls, Watercooler Conversations, Hallelujah Hangouts, Weekly Cooldowns, etc.
    - Some more general community-building events would be cool. We are all busy, but just some scheduled hangouts would be fun to get to know people better outside of the "work." Being online, we only get to interact in the contexts we create, so something simple could be engaging! This can be cross roles, between the voting and non-voting members of the DAO as well
        - Would need to figure out the perms and notification pathways, once an event is ideated
- Creating a Builder-Builder buddy system (We could have a form that could match people by interests or based on other factors, should be opt-in)
- Builder-Champion mentorship (Not the same thing as [intros.ai](http://intros.ai), it should be a bit more formal where builders and champions would meet 1-2 times per month)
    - There can be 2 versions of this.
        - 1:1s
        - or small junto based discussions (with few builders and champions around)
- Making discord less overwhelming (find resources for beginners and encourage people to mute channels)
    - Creating a Loom and a Notion Guide to the Dream DAO Discord
- Receiving compensation for contributing (proposal already approved)
- Finding low commitment ways to contribute
    - Increasing the visibility of low commitment contributions
- Having 1:1 Syncs or small jamouts with the Community Building Working Group
- Publishing more Dream DAO related and other Opportunities across the Dream Journal, Emails and Twitter than just on Discord
