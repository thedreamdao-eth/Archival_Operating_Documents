## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Charlotte

- When I joined consensus, 2018 had a huge crypto moment and then the market collapsed and the consensus laid me off when I was working on the social impact team which wasn‚Äôt valued much by the private sector
- Land registries can operate on blockchain (this is where government can harness blockchain)
- When consulting the UN, we emphasized that public blockchains provide trust, security, immutability, transparency, and speed.
- DLTs are great privacy measures that can be used for NFTs and DAOs
- There are many pros and cons to implementing blockchain to consider. Blockchain is not a panacea.
- China is doing the most robust research on the technology and various others are looking into CBDCs for blockchain-based currency
- Attestation through MIT‚Äôs OS City can be a way to record keep services and IDs and licenses
- Bond registry is also another means of using blockchain for more secure finance record-keeping
- Business efficiency can decrease fees and shorten times for finance flow and monitoring process
- Supply chains can verify the sustainability and legality of fisheries and product industries with dense supply chains and subcontractors
- Crypto aid can fund open source technology for children and young people around the world
- Cash transfers allow for end-to-end transparency from donor to operator

## Provocation/Question: What do you see as your future in web3?

- Ariana: I originally left because I didn‚Äôt see a place for what I wanted to work on.  I think the space has matured a little bit, but there are still the same questions and issues.  I am coming back now - and will hopefully be joining a company soon.  Currently in a DAO with Madison.
- It can be tiring to work on many things at one time.  I‚Äôve learned that traditional philanthropy/the UN are not for me.  There might be a middle ground.  I don‚Äôt want to be in a space that is fully clout-based and profit-seeking.
- I want to come back into the space.  I used to act as a translator and work with exchanging ideas, which I might want to do again.  I want to help bring out the smaller voices doing really cool work behind the scenes.
