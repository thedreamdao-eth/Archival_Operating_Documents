## The Discussion

---

**Does crypto have to be inevitably politicized? If it is, what is the best-case scenario?** 

- Arman (Karl): Politics and economics really impact one another. Since crypto is by and large a means of trade it will be politicized, our best-case scenario is having a policy that we all adhere to.
- Maddon: **Like net neutrality, this should continue to have interest and excitement across the political spectrum. It will continue to be defended and opposed by different factions on all partisan sides.**
- Chaleb: It doesn’t need to be politicized, at a fundamental level wasn’t meant to be a political issue. The way that it’s being applied, economic use cases, are political topics.
- Charlotte: Best case scenario is a world where crypto is acknowledged and respected.
- Shaan: Web3 isn’t inherently political but it is being used to navigate political issues. We should continue to encourage democratization.
- Ale: Also agree with the point of the many uses of crypto for health, education etc which relates to the point made about web3 term being more inclusive than crypto as people feel ownership on the changes and initiatives
- Angelina: And it also depends on your definition on politics. If you perceive politics as something touching on society, people´s lives and different interests, crypto is definitely political.
    - Amanda: I agree with Angelina, it's political in some points but it doesn't have to be ideological.
- Ahyun: Chapter four shows crypto through the lens of policy but this may be an issue we face in the early days of crypto - in the long term crypto may not be politicized.

**In Web3 socialists, libertarians, and people across political tribes can all be in the same groups and build together.** 

- Roman: Roman’s introduction to crypto emphasized community and seeing web3 as a public tool. **“You don’t argue the use of bricks to build homes”.** If web3 becomes fundamental to us it won’t become politicized.
- Chabu: +1 - the language we use is critical - even “crypto” → “web3” has been helpful in bringing more kinds of people in
- Arman: The more pople are exposed to Web3 the more likely they are to use the tool collaboratively.
- Chaleb: In a world where so many things are politicized it’s likely that Web3 will still embody the qualities of current political systems.
- Gary: Different perspectives are able to build and contribute to certain components of Web3. This is an opportunity to see a great use case for collaboration.
- Oliver: Diverse political perspective can be a great strength because it brings together unlikely allies. There is an opportunity to focus on communities at a smaller scale.
- Madison: Yeah that is interesting because the reason why crypto is different as a tool in bringing people together is that the internet breeds individuality and web3, especially by the nature of DAOs, is ALL about communities.
- Gauri: I think first we must you know look at making it more accessible to people, in order for it to be justified fundamentally. And then different people could be using it for different productive goals!
- Tom: DAOs and Web3 have so much potential for building community - but the ability to scale is difficult. The legal and federal infrastructure is yet to create standardized tools that will allow this tool to scale.
- Ale: Small communities are incredibly important in the Web3. We need to focus on our common goals. People are going beyond their differences to focus on the issues they care about.
- Ahyu: We need a diversity of thought in the Web3 space to dismantle political barriers. These concepts don’t need to be politicized. Will it be easy for the Web3 space to find common ground/common objectives?
- Madison: I think critics focus on it too much as a currency and not a tool for social systems, and enthusiasts are too idealistic in thinking that it will solve everything
    - Jae-Hee: I think that the emphasis of decentralization also may create a connotation of disruption and disorder for skeptics — which may alienate them further. I think some elements of centralization are necessary for social functions, like our defense systems
- Gary: There isn’t enough discussions and clarification around what our shared vision is.

**What does everyone think the critics are missing about web3 and what are the evangelists overlooking?**

- Chaleb: We are overlooking legal and regulatory issues that most evangelists don’t discuss. Especially through the lens of DAOs and smart contracts. There are legal questions that need to be answered.
    - David: I think the topic of smart contracts in non-financial areas should help bridge critics and evangelists.
    - Arath: Smart contracts are a great idea but there are unforeseen circumstances that might make it difficult to lean on smart contracts as a tool.
- Ale: Most people still see Web3 as a way to make money. Scaling is still uncharted territory; we need to establish governing practices and standards. Governing at a larger scale might be time-consuming in practice.
    - Gary: There are DAOs that are trying to emulate the way the U.S. government works. Should DAOs optimize to govern large groups of people or smaller communities? DAOs should continue to optimize for smaller communities that support local action
    - David: would be interesting to see if condo/co-op boards or rental communities are the right model for this?
- Madhav: I think that if you look at the real defination of politics is to make a decision in a group and blockhcain being such a great method that can totally upend the situation it will be politicized .
- Aditya: Most critics don’t see web3 beyond it’s economic contribution. Critics need to explore the ways that Web3 can help solve current issues.
    - Madhav: +1 Although Web3 is still developing and has shortcomings, it’s still a lot better than centralized systems.
- Tom: BUY CRYPTO TO GET RICH!! When that reality is sort of a thing of the past (at least with BTC/ETH) ((Note: I very much have crypto as part of my investment portfolio)). Not enough focus on freedoms from institutions + the technical aspects like smart contract that create new economic dynamics.
- Chaleb: if there are more web3/crypto legal tech evangelists I think you can convince a lot more "traditional" folks. we can't lie arguments from authority are very effective and having some great legal minds answer the touch crypto legal questions will be great

**What is the biggest battle that crypto needs to face in the upcoming year?**

- Gary: Serious action against the SEC is the next step for the crypto community.
- Maddon: Crypto needs to gain more legitimacy. Some political leaders don’t like crypto because it undermines the dollar. Crypto needs to be seen as something that helps, not something that is dangerous.
- Ethan: Clarity is really important to crypto. There are limitless possibilities for crypto, only talking about its possibilities through traditional economic spaces puts unnecessary constraints on Web3. We need to center the other components of Web3.
- David: Biggest battle (particularly in DAOs) is knowing people by their real name. Identify verification is a topic that web3 should be able to drive forward and will give it legitimacy
- Thomas: If you haven’t seen it: everyone should watch the Richie Torres question in congress about destabilizing the dollar and how crypto can actually enhance the power of the American Dollar.

**Could it be possible that DAOs help bring the focus of public debates back to actual content and issues?**

- *we may need to table this due to time*

## Reflections and Takeaways

*What is one thing you learned from this conversation? What new questions did you develop during this session?*

- **David Cooperstein:** We are still in the early stage of application, regulation, and impact that requires a lot of legal and societal thinking. This is a long-term journey to web3, like 1995 with web1
- Mirna: I learned a lot from this convo I still don't know a lot about crypto and web3 so I tried this time to listen more about what has been said instead of sharing my thoughts. but overall I gained so much today.
- Elena Ashburn: I learned a lot from this discussion. It brought up a lot of questions about the concepts of politicization and apolitical things that are super applicable to my work outside web3. I’ll definitely still be mulling over the question about the size of DAOs- how can we use the size of DAOs to our advantage to do the most good?
- Jae-Hee Bae: Our convo strayed away from economic discussion but I’d still like to bring up another point by critics — the scalability problem. Concerns around how Bitcoin and Ethereum have run into this (ex. Ethereum can process 15 transactions per second) as well as gas fees that rack up with scale. Ethereum 2.0 tho is anticipated to theoretically handle 1,000 transactions/second.
- Madison Adams: I love this conversation so much! It was so good that it made me wish we could build more on certain points, but it is hard in a big group. I might suggest that we do the first part together to compile interesting topics, do smaller breakout rooms for the main discussion to go deeper, and come back for the reflection to see the major takeaways from each group!
    - I think there should be more videos! Also, things that don't require so much background knowledge
- Maddon HC: DAOs are really new and have a long path ahead of them to prove themselves to the political and economic world.
- Charlotte Bruderly: I learned a lot from the conversation.  One thing I really appreciated was the idea of legitimizing crypto in the public sphere.  I wonder how this can happen in the coming years.
- Joshua Cruz: I learned a lot from everyone! I’m new to this and hearing the different points if view from the discussion made me want to read more and more and learn more about web3. These topics are so interesting.
- Ethan Wei: A takeaway I had was on the topic of governance. There’s still so much to think about in terms of scale and style of governance; it’s a topic that might even be more important than the financial regulations.
- Oliver Yehlik: I think I am left with a question of how we can improve accessibility and trust (considering misunderstandings by lawmakers). As a few people pointed out, a lot of us have entered this space because of the Dream DAO community. I think legitimacy could be improved by forging and onboarding people into these communities.
- Tom Segal: Just getting my brain further cranking on the balance of scale within DAOs... and how this will evolve as new people enter the world + veterans figured out best practices. 2021 showed how quickly DAOs can rise (CONSTITUTIONDAO HOMIES STAND UP) - now we need to figure out how to slowly scale. The good news is DreamDAO is taking an intentional slow build as we wrangle and onboard the community. We will lead.
- Madhav: You can be all optimistic and looking for the future but still to get stuff to the masses there needs to be a government policy and legitimacy needs to be recognized by the institutions.
- Arman (Karl): This talk allowed me to think about the shortcomings of the evangelists and of the aspects, skeptics tend to overlook when it comes to web3. It reinforced my idea of Crypto mutually affecting economics and politics.
- Ahyun Jung: This session was really insightful as we talked about the potential of web3 and cryptocurrency, in its role to poke at social impact. There are clearly many goals to set and preparations to build as a community, and it was interesting to be a part of the discussion in exploring the possibilities of the DAO, the crypto world, and web3.
- Angelina Schülke: Before this session, I wasn´t really aware of the political dimension/potential of crypto, now I feel like there is so much to explore regarding both the public and everyday life impact of crypto beyond work/economic investments/social engagement
- Rashmika: I was really disengaged from the conversation today as I was unfamiliar with the topic of discussion but I thought it was really insightful and I will definitely read up on crypto and web3 and ofc the theses which sound really interesting.
- **Destiny Patton**: I learned that there are more components to the web and the future of crypto than just users and technology. There are communities and other systems that play into making a successful web future.
- Armando: the crypto world is pretty interesting, unique, and awesome, we just need to learn more about it.

*What can we do better next time? How can we improve our next Dream DAO Explorer session?* 

- **Jason McCutchan**: If we’re going to continue leveraging Zoom can we utilize their breakout rooms? I.e. we have 37 people and we could break out to smaller rooms with 6 people to talk in small groups then bring the small group ideas afterwards to the larger group. Can allow for more familiarity between builders/champions or general members.
- Charlotte Bruderly: I would consider smaller groups or breakouts within the discussion.  This would allow a more personal conversation and more ideas as a whole.
- Ethan Wei: This was my first time in this style of discussion, and one thing to consider is a pre-mortem document where people can contribute ideas, questions, etc. asynchronously before the session. It’ll probably help with efficiency and value of responses.
- Arman: I agree with Ethan!
- Maddon HC: We should let people who contributed to the conversation write what they said, instead of having someone else write for them.
- Kevin Shane: There's still so much that is unknown, which is both a fear and an opportunity. The roles that we and many others in web3 are undertaking is what's going to get us to the next phase.
- **Dariel Cruz Rodriguez**: limit call participants or break into breakout rooms, perhaps do something where champions are junto guides and builders can be mentored by them in these learning journey
- Tom Segal: We need more Thanasi.
- Joshua Cruz: Maybe making breakout rooms and discuss deeper and then return to the main session and share what we were discussing to all people.
- Elena Ashburn: I would say make the discussion group smaller to ensure the participation of more people within the group.
- Chabu: How can we create break out rooms based on interests and sub-topics?
- **Dariel: This was a dense + long reading. Hard to do this not on holiday break.**
- David: Tackle a problem to solve, rather than an open topic.
- Chabu: We should set criteria for the resources we will be diving into

Open Questions 

- What is the frequency of these?
- How do we use this to test out materials for the explorer's program
- What is our minimal expectation? We need to make expectations very clear
