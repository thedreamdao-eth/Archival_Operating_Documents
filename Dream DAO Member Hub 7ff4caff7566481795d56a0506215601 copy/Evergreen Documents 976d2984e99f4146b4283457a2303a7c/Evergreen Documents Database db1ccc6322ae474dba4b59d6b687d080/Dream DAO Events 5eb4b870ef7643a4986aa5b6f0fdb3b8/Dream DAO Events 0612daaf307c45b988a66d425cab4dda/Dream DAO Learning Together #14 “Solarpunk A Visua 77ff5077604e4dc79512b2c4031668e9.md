## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Charlotte

- Christian has worked with many art mediums but has always been fascinated by nature and structure.  Recently, he worked on an NFT collection that led him to the idea of solarpunk.
- Cyberpunk is a science fiction genre that emerged in the 60s and 70s.  It visualizes a dystopian future.  There is technology. but it exists without human benefit.
- Solarpunk is a branch from cyberpunk.  It’s main idea is that we can hope for a brighter future.  By giving ourselves permission to dream, we can make our actions count.
    - Embracing nature while using technology to create a sustainable society
        - Self governance
        - Localization
- Aesthetic Influences:
    - Age of sail paintings
    - Art Deco
    - *Spirited Away* and other anime genres
- “Solarpunk recognizes science fiction as not just entertainment but as a form of activism” - *Solarpunk Manifesto*
- Creative Principles:
    - Tech-nature merge
    - Re-use
    - Newly synthesized
    - Collaborative & empowering choice
    - Small actions & localization
- Also includes music and sound
    - For example, AES Dana
- Crypto Coral Tribe - solarpunk-inspired collection
    - **The goal: to empower the community to participate in restoring nature**
        - Partnered with four coral-planting NGOs to plant 3,000 corals
    - Memebers with NFTs will work to bring and reap rewards for the community
- “Solarpunk is the world we hope for.  It is to see we have a choice.”  Make it your own.

## Provocation/Question: How does solarpunk change the way you view contemporary issues?

- Madison: I feel that solarpunk doesn’t make sense if it’s not vegan.  What is your perspective?
- Christian: It gives you something to measure against.  Nothing is perfect; it’s about relating the issues of today to the goal.  I’m not pro or against veganism - although there is an environmental impact.  There is space for other strategies and values in solarpunk.
- Christian: In reference to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.  Solarpunk inspires action.  It’s a framework that gives you something to aim for.  Without it, what would inspire change?
- Jae-Hee: Long-lasting movements have a core.  I like that solarpunk is an idea that is open and evolving.
- Christian: The ideologies that allow us to dismantle negative structures are ideologies with openness.  The upside is that you can make the idea your own.  The downside is that there has to be a common language and guidelines for a movement to succeed.
- Oliver: You can’t define something that is living and growing.  To define something is to set those boundaries.  Solarpunk can’t be bounded because there are constant connections to everything around it.  It’s an exercise in knowing ourselves and the world around us.  It doesn’t necessarily have to be something that is clearly defined.
    - Christian: It’s why it works so well as an artistic movement; you can adopt it in whatever way you are interested in.  Sometimes, we emphasize what needs to change externally without approaching ideas from a different perspective internally.  It’s very true.
- Arman: Previous art movements haven’t cared how other people see the world - only how the artist does.  Solarpunk gives us the room to have no definite boundaries.
- Christian: I like the idea of mystery.  As humans, we try to distance ourselves from mystery.  It’s a beautiful journey to figure things out; on the other hand, there always has to be something to figure out.  It’s vital to have a mystery/dream pocket in our culture.
- Christian: Art has evolved from mystery to reality to abstract.  People have inspired new ways of thinking with their art.  There’s a massive opportunity for that to happen again today.
    - Dwreckless: Solarpunk is timeless.  It pulls historical and cultural elements through different eras of time.  **I think we will start to see, with NFTs, the blending of all of these movements.
    - Christian: NFTs are the ultimate platform, in this sense.  It’s a collaborative space, and voices from all areas can be heard.  There needs to be some coherence within movements and ideas.

## Reflections and Takeaways (10 mins)

*What is one thing you learned from this lecture + conversation? What new questions did you develop during this session?*

- Jae-Hee: This conversation reminded me of a conversation I had.  We need to shift the way we understand our place in society and the universe.  Technology was produced by natural organisms... it’s an extension of nature.  Solarpunk is able to bring those ideas back.  In the Industrial Age, we’ve seen survival of the fittest as the strongest.  But now, I see it as who is able to fit in and work with nature.
- Arman: I never knew technology could be an extension of nature.  People are inspired by stories and artwork more than they are by facts.  Although we view ourselves as rational creatures, we reach for intangible feelings.  Thank you for bringing us this discussion.
- Madhav: We need to propagate the idea of solarpunk.  Even if we only change the reception of the idea a little bit, it could change everything.
- Christian: I like the idea that technology emerged from nature.  However, I think it’s important to stress the idea of technology worship.  We need to be careful; there is still a lot of scope for infringement of privacy and manipulation.  We need to negotiate how far we will allow technology to take us.
- Angelina: I really appreciate that the solarpunk movement includes ideas of reuse.  That’s what nature does all the time.  It’s easy to say that we can make all things new.  I think it’s important to think about how we can move on from what is already existing.  We need to be conscious of where we came from.
- Oliver: I love solarpunk.  I can always take away from solarpunk discussions a mind-blowing moment.  Part of solarpunk is breaking down the barriers and boxes we have put ourselves in.  Building a cultural movement like solarpunk opens up people to so many things.  Still, you are inevitably excluding things to keep that cohesiveness.  The only constraints for solarpunk are things and values we won’t negotiate on.
- Arman: What questions can we leave this discussion with?
    - Christian: Ask how we can shift our impact.  What can we do in small ways to improve the world around us?  How can we make the time to reconnect with nature?  Span that out - how can we live closer to the solarpunk values?  How can we work in ways that embrace solarpunk values?

*What can we do better next time? How can we improve our next session?*
