## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Charlotte

- Nirvaan Ranganathan is part of the Climate Collective.  The goal is to back money with nature.
- Two types of carbon markets
    - Mandated offsets vs voluntary offsets
- (Carbon is one dimension of climate finance.)
- Climate Collective is an ‚Äúinnovation network.‚Äù  The group gives grants to many projects in the web3 x climate space, coordinates works among members, and builds community (with an ecosystem map, for example).

- Climate Finance 101
    - Donations are the traditional pathways for NGOs.  Donations are based on goodwill.
    - Credits are a mechanism to ‚Äúoffset‚Äù greenhouse gases with the purchase of claims to carbon.  A registry is created by people going to projects and investigating; this gives people trust in what is purchased.  There is a question about long-term sustainability and also leakage/unintended consequences.
    - Equity: For-profit investment in the project.
    - Debt: Loans can support a project.
- ReFi: ‚ÄúA financial system that internalizes the costs and benefits of changes in nautral resources.‚Äù
    - Digital and financial tools must be created around environmental assets.
    - The concepts of ReFi work best with web3.
        - Issues with fraud and accountability may be addressed in this way.
- Web3 can help ReFi by increasing accessibility, creating community momentum and systems, and coordinating large groups.  However, web3 must evolve beyond web2 systems.  Web3 in ReFi must be interoperable; entire isolated systems are not as effective.
- **Use 1: Carbon Markets**
- Historic Carbon Markets:
    - Cap & Trade - limit on pollution
    - Certification systems of carbon claims
    - Exclusive to institutions
- Carbon Market Innovations:
    - Fractionalization (smaller units), liquidity (pooling assets), composability (embedded in code), collaterization (backing money with climate).
- There is a lot of potential in the future for carbon markets.
    - IoT - internet of things (application with data in carbon markets).
    - dMRV - measurement reporting verification for carbon credits.
- **Use 2: Localized Governance**
- ************Use 3: Mass Coordination************
    - Redemption DAO has a very time-sensitive mission with a very specific purpose.  It was an amazing way to show how quickly people can join and contribute to a group.
        - At times, things struggled because there was a lack of communication with local stakeholders.  **************************************************************Crypto colonialization should not be allowed to happen.**************************************************************
- Climate finance is not new, even if it hasn‚Äôt had a desired impact.  Web3 is a great opportunity for climate finance.  The first step is to address carbon markets, but the model should also expand.  Finally, we are in the early days - more resources are necessary.

## Provocation/Question: What background do members of Climate Collective have?

- Nirvaan: There are two buckets - crypto curious climate people and climate curious crypto people.  I, personally, am a climate curious crypto person.  I took a course ([https://terra.do/](https://terra.do/)) called ‚ÄúClimate Change for Software Engineers‚Äù that sparked my work.
