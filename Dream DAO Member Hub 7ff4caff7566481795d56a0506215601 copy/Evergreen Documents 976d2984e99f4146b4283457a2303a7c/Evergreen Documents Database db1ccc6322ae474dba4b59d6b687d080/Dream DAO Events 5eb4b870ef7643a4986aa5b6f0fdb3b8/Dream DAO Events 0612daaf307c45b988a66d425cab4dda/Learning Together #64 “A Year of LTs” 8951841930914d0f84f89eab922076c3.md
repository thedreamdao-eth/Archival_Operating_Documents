Message from Charlotte!

- Hello, all!  Thank you so much for reviewing the notes to this LT.  Unfortunately, due to low attendance, we did not believe that we could facilitate a robust discussion and cancelled the session.
- Over the past few months, LT attendance has been declining - people have been getting busy!  We anticipate to restart LTs in January (and soon with the new season of Builders!).
- Thank you for all of your support this year.  We held 63 other amazing discussions and could not have done it without your support!
