## how they want to be involved in the Dream DAO

**Joshua and Rashmika- will speak about how builders worked in S1 + ways to be involved for S2 builders** 

founded in late November, started S1 in January. finding and improving thing that members were creating. 5 working groups were there. Building and experimenting with the DDEP. DDEP- builders work w/ web3 orgs, work 10-20hrs/wk, get a stipend.  

How to engage- you have the freedom to contribute with whatever you want! You can still contribute a lot if you don‚Äôt have any knowledge about web3! work on bounties (one-off tasks that are paid). talk to people on Discord, join LTs, learn while working, try to stay active in your WGs and vote on proposals! Best thing- you can choose your time commitments and engage as you want! You also get to go to IRL web3 events funded by the Dream DAO! You can easily reach out to anyone for help and collaborate to get a task done! If you have any idea- talk to champions to get their inputs!

## Basics of transactions

**brief overview on how to make a transaction, what gas fees are (Thanks a ton Aryan for typing this out!)-** 

Transactions can be made on most chains using a wallet. In Ethereum mainnet chain, you can use MetaMask wallet to transfer funds from one wallet address to another address or ENS domain name. All transactions require additional gas fee to be paid for it to be successfully processed.

To send coins from your MetaMask wallet to another address:

- Open the MetaMask app or click on the MetaMask extension and login
- Check the network or chain from which you want to send coins
- Click on "send" button to transfer coins
- Paste the address onto the input or type the ENS domain name (in case of Ethereum chain)
- Enter the amount that you want to send to the selected address and click next
- You will see a prompt that summarizes the transaction and mentions the estimated gas fee
- If you are happy with the details, click on confirm
- The transaction will be processed in a few blocks which might take around 30 secs
- You can check if the transaction took place successfully on [https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/)

Gas fee if the processing fee that many chains require for the user to make any transaction. The total gas fee depends on a few factors:

- Network congestion. More the people making transactions, more the gas fee (Price of one Gwei) - simple demand and supply
- The type of transaction. Minting an NFT requires more gas fee than transferring coins to another wallet (Number of Gweis required to make the transaction)

You can save on gas fee by waiting for Gwei prices to fall. Gwei is a denomination of Ethereum which is used to specify gas fee. The Gwei price reflects network congestion. So, to save on gas fee, one should wait for the Gwei prices to fall.

Prabhat made an interesting observation - Gas fee is lowest around 2 AM - 3 AM EST on Sundays. To check gwei price, you can go to [https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/), There are also mobile applications that send out a notification when gas prices are low. Generally speaking, 10 Gwei or less is low gas fee and 5 gwei is ideal for making gas fee heavy transactions. However, this number will change overtime, so it is best to do your own research!
