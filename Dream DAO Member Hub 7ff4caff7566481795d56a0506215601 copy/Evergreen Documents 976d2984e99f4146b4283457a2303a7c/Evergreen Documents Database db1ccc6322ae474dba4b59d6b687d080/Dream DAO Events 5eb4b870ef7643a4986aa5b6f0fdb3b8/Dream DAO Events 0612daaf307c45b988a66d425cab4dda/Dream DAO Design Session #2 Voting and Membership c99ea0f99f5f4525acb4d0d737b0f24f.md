### Open Design Questions

***Voting***

- Initial Thoughts
    - We would love to use Snapshot to ensure that only Champions and Builders can vote. Is there a free or low-cost NFT/token we can give Champions + Builders that enables them to vote on Snapshot?
    - In this early phase of the DAO, we can use Discord features to ensure that only Champions and Builders vote.
    - Overall, we don't want a lack of programmers to prevent us from piloting governance methods that we can manually do without a specialized tool. The vision is to have a voting system that makes it very easy to maintain a merit system and voting process. In the meanwhile, we can use spreadsheets and Notion to track people's contributions and voting.
    
- Gary: Voting tends to be the last resort for communities and most communities vote on fully fleshed-out ideas.
- Tyler: How decentralized do we want to be early on?

*We would love to use Snapshot to ensure that only Champions and Builders can vote. Is there a free or low-cost NFT/token we can give Champions + Builders that enables them to vote on Snapshot?* 

- Tyler: Just because you own a SkyWalkerZ doesn't mean you get to vote. There are other key contributions, including voting. Should we issue a separate token?
- Gary: Can our community use alternative voting platforms (e.g. Discord) for voting?
- Tyler: Is there a process in place to verify that everyone who is a Champion has a SkyWalkerZ?
- Jason: Snapshot should have something native to limit access or have integrations. Discord has more overhead to maintain but obviously quicker to implement
- Gary: What is our interim solution?
- Jared: Using Discord in the near term for relatively low-stakes voting is good by me, for all the reasons you've just laid out Gary.
- Carl: Has experienced voting via discord! There are ways to make it time-limited. Snapshot is great for having a legal record of things.
- Gary: We would still need to engineer Snapshot to fully embody our voting system. The more you vote the more power you should have to vote in the future.
- David: How difficult is it to set up/share a token with the community?
- Gary: We don't want to use/create a token that will force us to continue to use one if it's not necessary
- Sean: (ERC 20 - tokens, POAP - type of participation NFT, ERC 721 - NFTs) Can be used as tokens
- Gary: Using tokens is a serious design choice that has long term-implications and our community should take the time to think it through
- Jason: ERC 721 may not be a permanent design choice and could serve as an alternative.
- Gary: We want to have clear distinctions between owning an NFT and voting
    - Jason: Can we create an 'allow' list of SkyWalkerZs that are allowed to vote (vis Snapshot)
    - Sean: You can link Snapshot with [Gild.xyz](http://Gild.xyz) to create an allow list

***Membership*** 

- Initial Thoughts
    - What do we do with people who apply to be Champions or Builders who don't make the cut for the founding group?
        - Builders: Provide individualized feedback.
        - Champions: Emphasize that they are still a founding member but because there are limited voting positions for kids there is a limit on the amount of Champions we can have.
    - **[If the question comes up about SkyWalkerZ buyers not automatically being voting members]**
        - We want anyone who donated by purchasing an NFT to feel like they are a part of the community. But the core component of governance is ensuring that there is an intergenerational balance of power.

*What do we do with people who apply to be Champions or Builders who don't make the cut for the founding group?* 

- *Builders: Provide individualized feedback.*
- *Champions: Emphasize that they are still a founding member but because there are limited voting positions for kids there is a limit on the amount of Champions we can have.*
- Gary: How do you send "not ideal news" to great people within your community?
- Chabu: Can we have a delayed acceptance process?
    - Jason: Similar to waitlisting
- Jared: I think uniform language to everyone along the lines of "Unfortunately, due to the high volume of applications we received in our initial month(s), we cannot accommodate every application in our first block... but every application will be seen and reviewed," etc. With individualized follow-ups to people, you're most excited about it is totally appropriate.
- Carl: Is there a way to specify when certain 'classes' are established?
    - Carl: Can someone ebb and flow into their role as a Champion? Can you opt-out/in?
    - Gary: Attending design sessions can be a way of measuring contributions
    - David: We should define what types of contributions Champions can make.
    - Tyler: There are different kinds of contributions that have added value but may not be super obvious/flashy
    - Lucy/Gary: It's important to have a diverse community to help determine what our merit-based system might look like
