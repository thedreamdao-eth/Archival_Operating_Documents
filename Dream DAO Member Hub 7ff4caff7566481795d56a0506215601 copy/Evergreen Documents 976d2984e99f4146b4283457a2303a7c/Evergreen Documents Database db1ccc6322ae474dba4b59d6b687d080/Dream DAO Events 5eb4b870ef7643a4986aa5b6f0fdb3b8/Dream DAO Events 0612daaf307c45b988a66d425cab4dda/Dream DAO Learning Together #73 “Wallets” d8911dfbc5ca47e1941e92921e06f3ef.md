## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Josh

### Prof Stam & Shaan - Hosts of Learning Together Session üë±üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Professor Stam and Shaan are Founding Champions of the Dream DAO. Together they are hosting Learning Together #73: ‚ÄúWallets‚Äù which the purpose of this LT is to help people to understand why is important wallets in web3 & and how we can approach the most with them.

### Talking about Custody ‚≠êÔ∏è

- The Concept of Custody:

The process of depositing money in a bank is us giving the bank ‚ÄúCustody‚Äù over our funds. They are holding onto over money on behalf us.  The process  of we know today is to giving the bank the permissions to do so. They take our money in and lend our money so they give them to other people to start their business, lends etc.

The past few weeks have shown us the risks of holding funds with custodians like banks and the amount of trust required. **The fact here** is that it is your money but you are trusting in someone else to custody your money.

- Going Non-Custodial

Holding our assets in crypto wallets all us with a non-custodial solution where the user has the full autonomy and access to our funds. With this we have the possession of our own assets. We will have the freedom and the autonomy to do everything we wanna do with our funds.

A banks is necessary in the fiat world to help do things with our money. In crypto there is no need for this mechanism as all of us can connect our wallet to different apps and get access to similar services, all of this controlled by the holder (us).

### Why this is Important?

Users are constrained to services provided by their bank or banking partners. If you do not have access to certain services in a network, you must open accounts with other institutions to do so.

With non-custodial wallets, all of us are free to connect and obtain services from any provider at anytime without having to deal with expensive switching costs and the risk of custodial issues. Most importantly, all of us have more freedom over how we would like to use our own assets.

### Types of Non-Custodial Wallets

- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) is an interface or application that allows you to create and interact with your web3 accounts that are compatible with Ethereum.
- [Parity](https://www.parity.io/) is another browser-based wallet that provides access to Dapps and Ethereum transactions.
- [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/es/wallet/) is designed to access Dapps which works with Mist wallet, a full node Ethereum wallet.
- [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) is similarly popular online wallet based in Ethereum coins and tokens. It allows to make transactions without needing to download the Ethereum blockchain but does not integrate Dapps in the same way.

## Provocation/Question: Types of Wallet/Currencies

- Clara: Are MANA and Matic different types of currencies?
- Shaan: Yes! they are different tokems.
- Professor Stam: I cannot take assets that are in Ethereum and transfer them to Solana
- Shaan: It is important to know which wallet and network we are using. When it comes to Solana you use another wallet, and for Ethereum you use other one.
- Shaan: If you are no-technical, the best way to start is with a browser wallet.
- Professor Stam: For Ethereum we use ETH, for Solana we use SOL, if I want to transfer funds to other wallet like from Ethereum to Solana we need to use a bridge so we can make it possible.
