## Kickoff (10 mins)

To kick off the session, Gary spoke about his experience at ETH Denver.  He talked about the energy at ETH Denver, the importance of web3 memes, and the future.  Denver is in touch with different kinds of knowing.

Learning Together kick-off!  How do we create governance and how would we hold a ‚Äúconstitutional convention‚Äù if we were doing it today?  There is currently a bias - intensity of purpose - towards a narrow problem set.  We have moved away from looking at the collective as something that benefits the individual.  We should look at rational self interest as something connected to/expanded outside of ourselves.

## Provocation/Question: Have members of the community ever worked to lobby or talk on a problem?

- Anastasia: I‚Äôve done it once, in undergrad.  It didn‚Äôt feel productive.  What other experiences have you had?
- Chabu: My first experiences with political activism were ones in which we were given templates on how to work with political leaders.  It was effective and accessible.
- Allison (via chat): In response to the lobbying aspect, I have done phone banking and is currently working on writing a testimony to testify a bill here in Ohio. I think it's an excellent way to get our voices to be heard on a problem that's affecting us.
- Jae-Hee (via chat): Have only phone-banked and dropped literature...currently a part of Ohio's attorney general teen ambassador board but it doesn't do much policy-oriented stuff.
- Anastasia: 2022 is going to be a battleground year for crypto and federal policy.  Does it make sense for members of the Dream DAO community to put together policy proposals?
    - Gary: I‚Äôm going to be meeting with the governor of Texas to talk about web3.  We should; what do we want to say?
    - Anastasia: The DAO should do this!  Gen-Z is the one that is being affected by policy.
        - Gary: We have the right people; we need the ideas.  What do we want in legislation?
    - **Anastasia: Here are some resources for you to research crypto policy proposals**

- Chabu (via chat): We need to experiment with what is the best framing, how does this align with their EXISTING priorities, and what is the role/contribution of someone like the governor.
- Spaces like the Dream DAO work to collect and harness human energy to create solutions.  It‚Äôs all about re-engineering incentives.  Regenerative finance is the future.  There is so much to unpack; there is so much to do.

## Provocation/Question: Would it be wise to allow/support people in only focusing on a few priorities?

- Anastasia: People have talked about this.  ‚ÄúPeople are inherently selfish.‚Äù  This is the origin of our systems, and it has worked, especially in areas of global trade.  It fails in areas of collective movements.
- Professor Stam: Interactions with China show systemic, deep issues.  We see this with the NBA and the United States government.
- Anastasia: Incentives matter.  We need to make sure our incentives are aligned with the results we want to see.  If not, how can we take thoughtful positions that are less reactionary?
- Professor Stam: Established guidelines are important.  We need to make sure that people aren‚Äôt going to be building on something that will be constricted until there is no point.  More education is coming and that can lead to clarity.  Regulation is a spectrum, and it can be very helpful in bring people in.  People have different levels of risk-tolerance.
    - Chabu (via chat): On the note of the current political regime - some people would even call web3 a distraction from other institutional issues. Regulation/building the web3 space needs to feel like solving for those issues as opposed to introducing something new.
- Gary: There is tech for and against the human spirit.  There is neutral technology.  There is so much potential in discussing all of these facets.  This is a make-or-break decade, and we need to find people that don‚Äôt feel limited.  Web3 is full of possibilities - what really is a solarpunk future?  Then, we just need to coordinate as a collective body.

## Provocation/Question: What is the process for identifying externalities?

- Professor Stam: We can see a lot of examples of policy-makers and government doing things with good intentions but having too shallow of a position.  Unintended consequences can spiral and create an overall burden.  I see this in my own life.  Planning and design are the main reason things don‚Äôt go as well; we miss something critical, and things don‚Äôt work.  This is such an important topic to consider.  It‚Äôs better to identify the issues than not be able to fix them later.
- Anastasia: The highest impacts on the effect of a system happen in the beginning.  ‚ÄúGreatest latitude of choice‚Äù is at the start.  We tend to solve for the issues as they are linked to each other, rather than going to the root cause.  Politicians campaign on a particular problem (for example, affordable housing), and the solution causes another problem (for example, people stop moving to the city).  Our symptomatic approach is omnipresent.  Who do we answer to?  What do we care about?  System design and the incentives involved are the reason for this.
    - Look at examples of the American Senate and public elections.
        - Oliver: Differentiate between a dominate majority culture and a dominating culture.  Small groups that aren‚Äôt representative are still dominating the system because they are adapted to that goal.
- Oliver: When we go down to a base level, there are issues regarding purpose.  We need to find the core problem - what at the root is leading us away.  A business can easily recognize consequences and not solve the issues because of shareholders.  Develop the purpose from the start and take responsibility from the start.  We are still in one system; everything affects us.

## Provocation/Question: How do we move outside of atomized self interest?  How do we mindfully curate the public goods we enjoy?

- Anastasia: Solutions that we impose to solve a narrow problem can leave out other groups.  We need to think about how we can develop a larger solution.

## Reflections and Takeaways (10 mins)

*What is one thing you learned from this conversation? What new questions did you develop during this session?*

Chabu is willing to get started on a policy proposal with another Champion...  Anastasia and Professor Stam can help review and rework.  A message will be sent out into the broader Discord to allow others to join a design session.

Charlotte: Appreciated the energy of the session.  Enjoyed hearing about ETH Denver.

Angelina: Interested in identifying the root causes in our systems.  Very important to think about.

Allison: WOW, this LT is literally so mind blowing. I really loved discussing on the idea of the intersection of public policy x web3! üí´

Maddon: Politicians are going to fear and try to stop web3 unless its advocates speak out. 

**Gary:** Everything is a masterclass. The whole DAO is learning and movement building. The explorers are a position of privilege and RESPONSIBILITY. Communicate the spirit, like the governor of Texas. 

Ecology of memes that recurs in space, time, imagination. 

Twitter is a half a billion person amphitheater where everyone is trying to get noticed. Communities on twitter let people with high context and shared values/visions. 

**Chabu:** Authentic reaction means being hurt when people respond badly but TC gives a safety net. 

**Gary:** Safety net is a weird meme because net means trapped. We want regen regime to be a place where it‚Äôs a genuine **oasis** for ideas of relationships, for movement-building. Art captures people. Create a culture of oasis rather than virality. Organically figuring it out and building it and showing adults that young people are important. Young people should post stuff. Future of humanity depends on young people posting stuff on regen regime - setting the tone and setting culture of upwards spiraling. Tyler was like questioning my intent...if there is a problem in the DAO, create a process~!! No one is stopping you. If you want to do something, change it, propose it! 

- When you don‚Äôt have a rule or guidance, habits take over (old world takes over).
- We are an organism that needs structure. We‚Äôre all being conditioned by old world daays. What is old world (another LT?)
- If you wanna make something better, you can do something. This applies at every fractal level. Everyone does want to help! But we think the system happens to us. Even the people you think are the system are trapped and wanna do something about it.
- My convo with Abbott will be ‚Äúlet me help you‚Äù which is wild in the old world mentality. NNo one is trying to ‚Äútake credit‚Äù
- Fractal - once you realize there‚Äôs good people out there, you can believe it!
- Only gen z can convince gen z that web3 is on our side and change people‚Äôs mind
- We‚Äôre in this liminal place. Make the blueprint
- reflection is a delusion. but the talk is always happening! we‚Äôre always reflecting bc if we aren‚Äôt reflecting, we aren‚Äôt listening!

**Tyler:** Gary is putting the team on his back. 

*What can we do better next time? How can we improve our next Dream DAO Explorer session?*
