## Icebreakers + Intros (5 mins)

***PARTICIPATE FOR ATTENDANCE:** Type in your first and last name, favorite emoji to send friends, add a colon, and answer the prompt*

*Prompt: What is one question / provocation you had from the reading?*

- Gary 🧰: The best way to answer critics is to build.
- Lucy🌈: people don’t care enough about decentralization? or they literally can’t afford to care? should so much of the blame be on consumers who have other factors preventing them from learning about what they’re using and having the time/funds to use it ethically?
- Jae-Hee 🦧: Oops I did not read the reading.
- Charlotte Bruderly🪴:  How can people without the resources to work on decentralization still be involved in the process?
- Roman Messali 🎪: Quicky skimmed it before the session and my biggest immediate takeaway is that decentralization =/= undemocratic anarchy
- Aishah 🌺: Decentralisation is important to avoid influence from others
- Madison 😊 : Didn’t read it
- Aditya 😅: Sorry, didn’t get to read it completely.
- Ahyun :): Ah, didn’t read it.
- Madhav 🫂: people are everything, we need alignment of values and better coordination. We can build an overkill decentralized framework but its the people who need to decide.
- Allison: ah so sorry i didn’t read it 😅

Shaan: Self-governance is the way to determine actual property rights and value Coase externalities.

- Shaan: Self-governance is th
- Kevin Shane **🚀:** Re: the decentralized cities/states reading... Does anyone know of any new cities that any DAOs are creating outside the Wyoming DAO (I think that’s the one) that are planned to be built from the ground up IRL as decentralized?
- Ethan 🤝: What needs to happen before decentralized is favored over centralization? What are the incentives for each?
- Joshua 😑: didn’t read it complete.
- Thessy 😎 Will we revert to centralization out of convenience?
- Adarsh,  :
- Anastasia: How can we *sustainably* interest people in self-governance and resist temptations of centralization in exchange for convenience?
    - + how can we make it more *accessible* for people with less discretionary income to CARE enough about decentralization in order to be willing to pay for it and avoid the surveillance capitalist temptations of Facebook-style data-for-service businessmodels?
- Ale: if these new systems encode our actions aligned to incentives how do these scale beyond the code and into the human actions

## Framing from Anastasia (3 mins)

- **Anastasia:** Picked this article about best arguments with crypto + historical framing = to give us a chance to see how this moment is similar to other moments we’ve had in history (we’re not that unique) We were talking about the tension between better user experience and onboarding; better web3 and de-fi without “ease of use”
    - What’s wrong with ease of use and convenient business models

## How do we interest people in sustainable self-governance that is necessary for decentralization?

- Average users don’t care and can’t afford to care about self-governing that is necessary for decentralization.
- Anastasia: Jon quoted: “Already long ago, from when we sold our vote to no man, the People have abdicated our duties; for the People who once upon a time handed out military command, high civil office, legions — everything, now restrains itself and anxiously hopes for just two things: bread and circuses.”
- **Jon:** We also saw how privacy played out in web2 while cen and decen is playing out in web3 where you get this mirror reflection of centralization as platforms decentralize. We see this in major faces of human history where periods of decen gets overcome by cen forces that can execute better.

## Provocation/Question: What kind of incentive structures have we created in web3?

- 

## Provocation/Question: How do we interest people in sustainable self-governance that is necessary for decentralization?

- **Chabu:** Making self-governance without opting out of convenience. In my life, the extensive complicated process that I chose had a culture that was exciting to be around. The culture of self-governance must be exciting to be a part of. The process itself should be something you want to be a part of recreationally.
- **Thessy:** The matter of convenience is important; we are in a nation-state and other systems — how do we create + lift other values despite sanctions. That is the bigger picture for me at least behind web3 — if you’re committed to that bigger picture, you can go through those inconveniences.
- **Ethan:** People don’t really know what they want until you show it to them. Show that decen is as good as efficient as cen existing tech. “This is the potential” but until the potential is not realized until it happens.
- **Madison:** I feel like ****people won’t care about cen until they face negative consequences for it like they get more customized ads but it’s not clear why it’s bad.
    - **Chabu:** Centralization has consequences but we need to create the compelling narrative about how decen can be contextualized with the emerging/pressing issues to show how web3 is relevant to what is being discussed right now + onboard them to web3. They realize it would solve the challenges they care about.
- **Tyler:** We’re trying to create the right incentive structures. Right now web2 is not aligned to social good. Cen technologies seem purely technically better but web3 isn’t just about the pure tech it’s about community building that push people together in an efficient way. Flip your brain in a way that lets them get past their predispositions.
- **Arman:** I totally agree with community aspect. Decen is the positive side of capitalism where people consciously know what they’re doing. With the right incentive structures we’re ramping up this process.
- **Ale:** How the code and tech is aligning our incentives with ReFi and tokenizing the Earth’s externalities. The incentivies are right now so disaligned but in the long term, the code would eventually shift our minds to actually value the things that don’t necessarily have monetary value but have true value.
- **Thessy:** Efficiency is needed here. And to gain something. But the real problems are more essential, the kind that don’t need incentives. Many understand this but lack the technology. So we must create these communities where we work with those who know these issues. If we don’t we will revert back to efficiency and cen.
- **Anastasia:** The demand side of the equation is about the incentivized for making that preference. We nail that there needs to be an awareness about why this matters to willingly choose to “not abdicate your duty.” We understand the tradeoffs.

## Provocation/Question: Has there ever been a time when people voluntarily self-selected to doing the hard stuff? Or was it momentary and fleeting?

- **Jon:** We see this cycle across major eras of human civilization (egyptians, greeks, medieval, modern industrial rev) where you start with new coordination tech that federates and gets overcome with cen structures. Not typically a rebellion but the cen structures reaches excess and collapse where decen are born from those ashes.
    - ex. The first version: The emergence of civilization from irrigation networks. The case was that most effective examples have going on for thousands of years (original DAO: irrigation networks) that have sustained across various cen structures we put in place.
- **Arman:** Moments of cen has been created in response to decen. Cen has been created to curb/shadows decentalization. This has been happening for centuries.
- **Gary:** I wish that all these different disciplines that there could be this enthusiastic evangelist to show all sectors are important.
- **Roman:** One of the most important incentives for decen is responsibility. Local gov in America were set up for most power. Many don’t feel the responsibility to uphold this but they take the easy way out. The problem with the easy way out is because efficiency outpaces human nature. Late stage capitalism shows that corporate interests are dominating us.
- **Charlotte:** One of the reasons why people distance themselves from responsibility since they haven’t seen themselves in different disciplines. Every individual has a passion but it’s limited to a single area but by not expanding that bubble all of these different areas get little support instead of larger support by the masses.
- **Ale:** My thought was that maybe we go into so much into efficiency we’re destroying our environment + minds — no one is thriving. We’ve shifted so much that we are returning from that. It might also be that building those new infrastructures grounded in passions and values is easy but the hard part will be about convincing those who prefer short-term living. I agree that an evangelist who galvanizes meaning would be so cool to show the way to get involved and align excitements + visions with use-cases in the world.
- **Tyler:** We’ve almost broken the environment and almost our minds. We’ve all became these robots of algorithmic rabbit-holes. We’ve sacrificed our thinking to efficiency. How do we help to get people back to the local and decentralized? Web3 is a physical ownership of stake whereas before it was in goodwill. Now an NFT of tokenized ownership helps to actually ground you and keep you engaged for longer with this revolutionary anchor.
    - As time evolves, it will become more and more of a standard to align with our values. The more we build, the more we create best practices.
- **Jon:** I reject the premise of the provocation that decen is necessarily the hard way. But it becomes the better approach with new coordination tools that let us to do new things that we couldn’t do. Phonetic alphabet was an unlocking technology — when you get these opportunities, we get tools for actual self-custody and decen ownership of governance tokens we can do things that aren’t easier but create new pathways.
- **Thessy:** On token economies, we need long-term incentives. We need to ensure that especially in a capitalist system. With tokens, it is programmable and we can create long-term incentives. And it is harder right now because tools and eventually diversification (which brings problems into creation process rather than a particular group that is already in agreement) although it will yield smarter products.
- **Anastasia:** With that false dichotomy about the idea of convenience vs tech. We’re forgetting that tech is to make something easier starting from irrigation to printing press, etc. Tech literally exists to make things easier at an atomic scale. Cen brings scale faster of tech that breaks the whole thing — oops. If we take that framing, blockchain makes it easier to self-publish, create, and be yourself online. Cen temptations may scale this (Coinbase’s access to blockchain, for example or OpenSea).

## Provocation/Question: Can we scale without centralization?

- **Arman:** This is like music. Until the 19th or 20th century there wasn’t a conductor. More chamber music-style which is what communities in Asia and Africa this was continued (playing without a conductor). We can scale without cen as long as we recognize people for what they are good at. Assuming vs understanding is key. Centralization is like an illusion where we assume vs realize. We can definitely scale as long as we understand/remain mindful.
- **Ahyun:** I agree. Initial power structure can exist the thing is that we must make them less toxic by shaping mechanisms into healthier structures so individuals can contibute to communal system. Creating this structure or system is dependent on information access and networks that develop. How we can all fit into the bigger picture.
- **Arman:** We often tend to contradict or assume that convenience is best. Scaling without centralization juggles growth and convenience. As long as we are able to learn the convenience part, we are able to do something good. Our brain often tends to decrease friction the way we do stuff. If we are able to control that subconscious, it helps psychologically.
- **Jon:** Historically, yes. This is what federated stuctures have typically emerged. Like local gov structures emerge in decen way and they copy+paste and network like greek city-states and medieval market-towns and small new england towns. The devil is in the details.
    - DAO governance frameworks and tooling: There is no better way to invest your time than coming up with right framework / mental models / tools. Read the federalist papers to see what founding fathers and Aristotlean and Eleanor Ostrom (spelling?) were thinking. We need to see how these new tools provide a path to do this. Understand how this played out in the past and how we can tweak to sustainably scale.
- **Ale:** What’s the most needed need in this space? We’re speaking about incentives and how it can be built into the code. The effect of the action is in the code but how does that translate into human physical actions that doesn’t occur just in the code but in the human mind and with each other.
- **Jon:** Most stuff that’s happening with DAOs is purely on chain. But how about IRL? We’re trying to figure out how blockchain governance structures is about shared financial value on chain. The human element is the hard unpredictable part. We can try many governance structures to innovate, explore, and diversify our trials of seeing what works best.
- **Gary:** America is often called a laboratory of democracies but the way our political systems are set up, we can’t really learn. It’s often just bad faith politics so DAOs excite me since it’s good faith people to come together and try and make things work.
- **Tyler:** Do DAOs get to a point of maturity where bad faith behavior stops again. Proper planning should be thought about towards 5 years in the future since these things spin back into cen. How do we programmatically stop this from happening?
- **QZ:** DeFi lets you do powerful things like lending many governance tokens to sway a vote. One day I can show up with 300,000 votes and pick who gets what. Token voting should be taken with a pinch of salt but still experiment since it’s like physics (you observe and move). We need to figure it out by helping govern. We need spaces like these to not only research but trial.
- **Jae-Hee:** liked how he brought in physics! QZ is                                      Just enjoying listening! (we <3 u Jae-Hee)

## Reflections and Takeaways (10 mins)

*What is one thing you learned from this conversation? What new questions did you develop during this session?*

- **Gary:** This platform is awesome. It was meta (kind of). This platform reminds us that coordination tools affects our coordination.
- **Anastasia:** We shape our tools and thereafter the tools shape us.
- **Arman:** It’s much more about being accountable about what we’re good at and what we’re not.
- **Shaan:** You can’t have decen without centralization.
- **Madison:** People talk about why we need diversity in all kinds. Diversity is essential to making web3 the best version of itself. Many people would benefit extremely so they can help ground what we’re building so it serves all walks of life.
- **Jae-Hee**: qualm with the platform itself - have to go back and forth as a notetaker, can’t see everyone’s screens
- **Madhav**: Embrace the unknown unknown.
- **Tyler:** Could we connect a widget where you can connect your wallet to the call. To mint guest badges.
    - **Gary:** Another example of tooling for scaling. To expand our community.
    - **Thessy:** This is how to bring others.
    - **Tyler:** Creating more utility with the NFTs.

*What can we do better next time? How can we improve our next Dream DAO Explorer session?*
