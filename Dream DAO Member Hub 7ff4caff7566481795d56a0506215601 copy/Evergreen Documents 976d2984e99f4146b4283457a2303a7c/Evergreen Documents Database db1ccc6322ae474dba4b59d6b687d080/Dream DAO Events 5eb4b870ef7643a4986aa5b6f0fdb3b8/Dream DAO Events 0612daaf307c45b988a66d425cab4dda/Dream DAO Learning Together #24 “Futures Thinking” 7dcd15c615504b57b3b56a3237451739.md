[Futures @ Dream Dao April 26 2022](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J7F6e5YfyA4MXGiNYWYzuSSEvzXLU--VWPd4sDpkMys/edit#slide=id.g12255d82606_0_49)

- Intro: Eddie, is a policy analyst in a company in Singapore, and he is also a researcher. He previously worked in the Singapore government which made him think a lot about futures thinking. (check recording pls)

**Why and what is Futures Thinking/Strategic Foresight?** 

- Have a sense of what web3 wants to accomplish and think about the steps you can take today to get into the vision of the future you see (vision + process).

**Think about the last 10 years: what “weren’t supposed to happen” did happen?**

- This question reminds people that a lot of things happen in the past and now it looks totally normal.
- Saf: covid
- Eddie: covid, trump, Brexit, Russia-Ukraine war, refugees in Europe, nuclear accident in Japan, sovereign debt crisis
- The next 10 years will be different from the last 10 years. The past will be a memory and storytelling may take a great part in this.

**We need different ways to think about the possible futures, and just to use examples we already do that with our imagination**

- e.g: movies (minority report, avatar, bring him home - the martian, wall-e).
- How do we go through a process using our imagination to have a vision of steps to take, and reframe?

Scenarios → process: we start with the **focal question** (what do you want to do) > go out and check **trends, signals,** etc > **impact x uncertainty** > scenarios > signposting, monitoring, scanning > strategy, resourcing, financing, people strategy, etc

An interactive example of the scenarios process:

→ Step one: define your **focal question** - How will Web3 influence inclusion (through DAOs) in the next 5 years?

→ Step two: identify **trends** that could influence the focal question

answers: political (increased partisanship), social (a social trend, increasing visibility of diversity in web3 spaces), technological (massive increase/improvement of digital infrastructure in rural/remote regions), environment (climate action failure)

- **Sometimes you may have to see the big picture of some of the trends identified.**

e.g: **massive increase/improvement of digital infrastructure in rural/remote regions > Eddie:** this is an assumption, how can we rephrase this to be a trend? > ‘’whether or not there will be an improvement of digital infrastructure in rural/remote regions’’

*causal* *layered analysis of the trend:* 

1. historical neglect, rural poverty, history, politics
2. farming is irrelevant to the modern economy, we don’t need real food, people are backward in the rural region (worldviews)
3. life is getting rich so farms are not important, so only cities matter (myths/assumptions/deep stories)

Three horizons framework

- If I already know where to go then I just need to figure out the steps to get there: horizon 1 - what we want to replace, horizon 2 -  the things we want to do, horizon 3 - what we want

## Provocation/Question:

- Oliver: how do you address a question that is less goal-oriented?

Eddie: as people work through their timeline and stages, people will start to think about things in the middle, leave it more open (?)

- Angelina: would you say it’s more important to leave the question open? (like **will** there be ...). To what extent would you suggest including assumptions in your focal question?

Eddie: you can rephrase your question to something more open, less ‘’yes or no’’ during the process.

- Charlotte: How did you learn about this and how did you apply this to your work?

Eddie: I worked in the Singapore government so we dealt with many trends e.g elections. I apply this in different areas, I have a blog and also there are many community organizations that try to use this.
