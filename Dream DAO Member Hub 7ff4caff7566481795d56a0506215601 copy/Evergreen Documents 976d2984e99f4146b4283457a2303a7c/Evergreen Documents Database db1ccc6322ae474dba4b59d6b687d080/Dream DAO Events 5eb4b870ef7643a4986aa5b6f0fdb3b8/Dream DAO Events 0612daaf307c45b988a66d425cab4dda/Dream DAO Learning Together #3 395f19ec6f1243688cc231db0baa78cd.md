## Notes:

- Ale: Fascinated by the potential of web3 to scale our social impact. We also know that our economic system are extractive, why are we continuing with them instead of following SDGs. I really like the sense of us taking the initiative, building new organisations and circular economies, by stopping to fight for the old and starting what’s new
- We are focusing on building new systems: Parallel efforts with the end goal in mind.
- Public funding should to go two things: new ways to tackle problems, new ways to build ecosystems (see [From Knowledge To Wisdom](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/from-knowledge-to-wisdom/), leveraging philosophy to guide science to guide engineering \\ the crux is still government support)
- What counts in a giving economy?
    - Rallying up the community: The Constitution DAO allowed people of immigrant status to get a sense of belonging.
    - Unlocking on abundant mindset
- Enablers are the ones who build the infrastructure of the DAO.
- Pioneers are the ones who create projects with specific purposes
- Convenors are the ones who are bringing the people and the money together in innovative ways to different projects

    Questions along the way:
    
    - What’s it going to take for decentralized institutions to replace legacy institutions?
        - KILLING MOLOCH (so we can collaborate) [how do we leverage optimism and goodwill to make change happen in the real world?]
        - Will the collaboration required for this kill the concept of decentralized institutions?
    - How can we leverage crypto/de-fi to reunify the global north with the global south?
    

## Reflections and Takeaways (10 mins)

- Thessy: There is a future of collaboration amongst DAOs - it’s needed. Great presentation :-)
- Roman: Really great intro to how all these different DAOs that serve diff purposes can support each other, the graphic helped set a mind map right in, not thought before, though we do that in current business world
- Charlotte: People often confuse Decentralization with disorganization
- Ale: I like how we represent nature + tech at the same time,
- Madhav:  there are SO many new DAOs that are emerging, lots of connections and so much value to be added
- Jacob: Although everything is decentralized, the power of optimism and collaboration revs me up. I hope it doesn’t lose spirit soon, we need such jams to keep us updated and on track
- Jae-Hee: It is almost like creating a new network, I wonder towards future as to what mass onboarding processes would look like.
    - Jae: I’ve seen divergence towards optimism and retrospective thinking independently towards solarpunk, how those two can merge together
    - Ale: It is really cool we are bringing a sense of past, passing it to inspire ourselves.
- Arman/Karl: Lots of insights, bewildered by the fact of being early, lots of scope, though losing track of quite a bit of information, I find pursuing it worth the effort. Amazing mind map out there Ale, thanks a lot for organizing this!!
- Gary: Didn’t realize how many projects we are in, Ale is a great systems mapper. Great for CU Alum to see a real world systems map. Missing category : Culture setters, played by the Dream DAO and in Gitcoin, convener might feel mechanical,
- Jacob: as the Web3 sphere expands, perhaps project/DAO categorizations by gradients / 2-dimenstional instead of linear/categorizations
    - interesting connection —> web3 is like Christianity in its adoption and spread (schisms?)

## Ideas:

- Refine Ale’s categorization framework
- Turn the evolution of the framework / adding of new projects into a more decentralized process
- Brainstorm what a web3 x social impact in-person conference could look like
- A monthly or every other month - State of web3 x social impact check-in -
