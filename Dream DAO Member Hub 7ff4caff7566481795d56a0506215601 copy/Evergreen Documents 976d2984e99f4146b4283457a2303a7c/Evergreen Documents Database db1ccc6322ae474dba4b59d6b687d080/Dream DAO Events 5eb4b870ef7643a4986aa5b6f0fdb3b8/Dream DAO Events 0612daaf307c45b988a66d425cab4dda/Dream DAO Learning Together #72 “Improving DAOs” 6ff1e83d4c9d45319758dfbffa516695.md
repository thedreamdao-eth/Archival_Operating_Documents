## Provocation/Question: Closing thoughts?

- Shaan: This article is very timely.  We need to think about efficiency and effectiveness right now, on a design and structural level.  Otherwise, there won‚Äôt be alternatives for people who need them.
- Caroline: Has Dream DAO encountered any situations in which problems surrounding efficiency were tackled?
    - Charlotte: There was just a proposal about voting.
    - Shaan: Collective ownership of DAO funds, using Snapshot.

## Provocation/Question: Have you shared information about blockchain/web3 with people you know?

- Charlotte: My family!
- Caroline: I am working on a Masters degree, which is where I was introduced to the technology.  I took a long time to explain what web3 is, what NFTs are, what blockchain is, etc.  These concepts are not intuitive.
    - Charlotte: There‚Äôs a lack of accessibility/resources in web3 compared to web2.
    - Shaan: It‚Äôs kind of how developers felt during the development of the internet.  Eventually it will be too late to be just starting out, and people will have to go through an immense amount of information at once.

## Provocation/Question: How do we decentralize?

- Fernando: I think that changing systems and transitioning is very difficult.  It‚Äôs important to think about the future.  We want to continue web3.  Builders right now may or may not work in web2, but that will have an impact on them either way.
- Shaan: Our path to decentralization would be lost on other people.  Is it up to us to bring more people in?
- Caroline: One of the reasons why people find this transition difficult to witness is that people are waiting for a moment to see a huge success of DAOs.  A lot of DAOs are not operating in a highly efficient way.  ‚ÄúActive‚Äù members of DAOs are limited, and DAOs struggle to find members that will do specific work.
    - Charlotte: I agree with this point.  There hasn‚Äôt been that much mainstream attention.
    - Shaain: ConstitutionDAO got the most attention.  But, since then, there have only been a few groups breaking into the media.  It‚Äôs super important for people in web3 to advocate for the adoption of DAOs.     Ultimately, even if it seems like people should make their own decisions, it is really important.  There is too much misinformation about crypto and ReFi.

## Provocation/Question: Initial Impressions?

- Charlotte: Scaling DAOs is a pressing issue - relevant to the Dream DAO
    - Shaan Patel: The article said that scalability is the biggest problem.  Used some interesting examples.  On-chain voting data proves that when there are too many people, it can become an issue.
- Josh: All articles that I have been reading recently talk about governance.  What is the experience going from a company to a DAO?  Roles make jobs more centralized, but is also more efficient.
    - Charlotte: How does web3 become more inviting to people with different skillsets?  How can web3 become more stable/marketable?
        - Fernando: I agree.  That‚Äôs something that I hear when I talk to people in Mexico.
- Charlotte: Does web3 have a branding issue?  Or are there actual structural issues?
    - Fernando: When I first heard about crypto, I was under the impression that you couldn‚Äôt trust it.  People have to live/work with web3 in order to understand it.
    - Ibtehaj: Web3 is very out-there in the media.  I think it‚Äôs a little bit of both.  Everything is very new; we are still trying to figure out solid structures.  Crypto is still banned in many places, and it‚Äôs understandable that people are still skeptical.
    - Shaan: We need to ensure that there is a safe way into web3.  DAOs can showcase that democracy exists in this ‚Äúfuture‚Äù space.
    - Charlotte: Most people don‚Äôt know what web3 is - they know crypto, and they don‚Äôt like it.
        - Caroline: I agree; I joined web3 about two weeks ago.  People know cryptocurrencies and not the actual technologies behind them.  Dream DAO stands out because it teaches and advocates for Gen Z.
