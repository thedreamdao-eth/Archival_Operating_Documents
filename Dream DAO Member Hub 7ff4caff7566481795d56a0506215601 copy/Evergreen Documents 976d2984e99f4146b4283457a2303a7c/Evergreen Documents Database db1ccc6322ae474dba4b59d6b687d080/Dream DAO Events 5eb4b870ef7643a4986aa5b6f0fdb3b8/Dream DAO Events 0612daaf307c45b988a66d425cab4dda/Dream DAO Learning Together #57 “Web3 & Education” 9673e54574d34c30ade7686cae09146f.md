## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Dariel Cruz Rodriguez

- We are in an early adopter phase of web3.
    - Web3 and education are extremely early in adoption in the world. There is no viable business model and it‚Äôs mostly a lot of experimentation in the sector.
    - There is so much learning left to do in the category over the next few years especially through bare market.
- How Reach Capital gets into this
    - 6-8 months spent diving deep to understand the web3 technology
    - Generally put companies into 4 categories:
        - focused on Onboarding (how to get people into crypto/web3)
        - focused on Learning (helps with learning component to leverage web3 tech)
        - Credentialing (certifying learning, POAPs, etc.)
        - Earning (making $$$)
    - There are so many web2 companies transitioning to web3, as well as web3 native companies.
- Ideas Reach is thinking about
    - What didn't work in web2 but works in web3
        - Knowledge networks - people pay $x amount of dollars to have someone (notable) talk to them for an hour
        - Learning, gaming, and earning ecosystems - participate in an earning ecosystem for learning, blockchain gaming, etc.
    - What exists in web2 but better in web3
        - Peer verified LinkedIn web3
        - Learning content marketplaces - Think ‚ÄòDummies‚Äô series
        - DAOs

## Are DAOs profitable for Venture Capital?

- Asked by Dariel, Answered by Jomayra
    - We don‚Äôt know about the outcomes. I bet 99% of the DAOs aren‚Äôt that great but there is that 1% that is. Most of the companies that end up creating something really good end up starting really centralized.

## How do you think web3 can help us develop traditional school systems?

- Asked by Rashmika, Answered by Jomayra
    - Web3 itself is just a technology like iOS, etc. it‚Äôs about how you use the technology to drive change. At present, it is fairly limited and it‚Äôs a new type of technology and incentive mechanism, we are seeing it used in learning DAOs which has raised capital to work together as a collective to build learning programming. Some are more organized, some aren‚Äôt.
    - People are incentivized to give back as a member of the DAO as compared to a traditional university. With that, it‚Äôs really hard to scale a DAO and keep the quality. The credential also still matters in hiring, credentialed universities are super important which Learning DAOs don‚Äôt have.
    - To replace traditional institutions, I have a harder time seeing that.

## How do web3 venture capital funds work?

- Asked by Amanda, Answered by Jomayra
    - ADDING ANSWER LATER
