## Kickoff (10 mins)

Oliver has spent a lot of time over the past few years writing a variety of things.  He likes articulating the patterns he sees and challenging his thought processes.  When he shares a piece of writing, he gets to communicate with a broader audience.

“Imagining a New Climate Narrative” is an essay framed around art and imagination.  He wanted to talk about “changing the conditions of what we know is possible.”  How can changing these parameters affect our actions?

Oliver wanted to write using both his ideas and the ideas of others, as well.  He wanted to talk through the thoughts of others.  He likes acknowledging the complexities of different topics, and he values the process of finding more questions through the process of attempting to answer one.

## Provocation/Question: What points did you most want to get across with your essay?

- Oliver: Making the effort to care and giving each other the space to feel feelings about climate change and existential problems is important.  Imagine the stories we are telling with the complexities they truly have.  Understanding the stories that we are telling are never going to live up to every nuance but being okay with telling the stories anyway.  And be nice :)
- Aditya: Before the essay, I had a very analytical approach to climate change and problems like that.  Oliver’s essay brought in art and culture and storytelling, which have very important roles.  The engineers that design the solutions aren’t necessarily the people that can convince the public that they can be implemented or give hope.  A lot of fields and a lot of people need to come together to solve the issue.
    - Oliver: I really love that perspective.  The solution to climate - and a lot of things - is really simple: everybody doing the things they really love.  We need every engineer that is going to build every solution.  We need every storyteller to tell solarpunk stories.  This comes back to the idea of coordination, as well.  If I’m telling a climate story, there’s also someone building a carbon capture device.
    - Charlotte: I think it’s best if everyone finds the topic and the problem they have the ability, passion, and capacity to care about.  110% in one area is better than 20% in another area, even if that other area is deemed more “valuable” by some other person.
    - Oliver: Becoming comfortable in knowing that there are other people doing the things.  You can give your full attention to specific things because there are other people that are there.  Of course, I don’t know how that works, exactly, in detail.  But it’s something I want to keep digging up.

## Provocation/Question: Where do you typically share your writing?

- Oliver: It’s also sort of a work in progress.  A lot of the time, it’s through social media (and the Dream DAO).  I’m currently in the crossroads of two roads for publishing - whether on one space/platform or individually.  I want to keep figuring out what I want to do with my work.
- Carl: I’ve seen others try to answer that question.  The answer I’ve seen is to write on the platform you most like writing on.  When it comes to publishing, Mirror isn’t as good as Medium.  Medium can reach more people, even though Mirror might be good for web3.  Substack could be good for a very specific audience but lends itself to revenue generation as well.
    - Oliver: I have a 1918 typewriter that I might start writing on…
- Oliver: You have to know who you are writing to.  In the past, it’s been the communities I’m a part of.

## Provocation/Question: Do you see a life after publication for this essay?  Or are you ready to move on to something else?

- Oliver: That’s a good question.  The framework of how I’ve been thinking about things - and the things I’ve been engaging with - has inspired a lot of my writing.  It’s definitely an area I want to keep exploring and pulling threads on.  Even in the process of writing, I come across many more things I want to talk about.  I don’t know what that looks like, exactly, however.  I’d be interested in hearing about others’ experiences with this.  I know I want to keep writing and sharing things publicly.
- Carl: I went through an online course where you wrote everyday.  You started to see that the essays you thought were the best didn’t always land, and the opposite was also true.  Quality will emerge with practice and time.
    - Oliver: I feel like I’ve always been very stubborn about the “classic” writing advice.  I don’t always listen to the suggestions of traditional writing.  But I definitely like that idea.

## Provocation/Question: “However, we must also acknowledge that caring for the world and all its inhabitants is not a role intended for one individual.”

- Aditya: It can be very overwhelming to learn about a number of topics without discussing or processing all of them.
- Ethan: I agree the quote was well-placed... coordination seems so untapped in these spaces
- Oliver: Something I really wanted to do in my essay was flow between hope and mourning and different emotions.  I watched a video titled “Reasons Not to Care.”  These topics are so complex there’s always a reason not to care - which is a good thing.  It’s too much for any one individual.  It’s important to recognize that there are other people that are bearing that too - and that can carry that weight if it’s not something you can attend to.

## Reflections and Takeaways (10 mins)

*What is one thing you learned from this conversation? What new questions did you develop during this session?*

- Charlotte: Thank you so much, Oliver!!!  Such a great perspective.
- Aditya: This was an amazing essay; I don’t think I’ve read something this good in a long time.  We had a great discussion, and I’m glad to be back to Learning Together sessions.
- Carl: I was thinking a lot when you mentioned writing for specific audiences.  I think writing for the Dream DAO/regen community is really great.  The audience is enthusiastic and supportive.  It’s such a powerful thing, and I’m glad that’s one of your own takeaways from the session.  I hope you keep writing.
    - Oliver: It feels really meaningful to write for the people that are close to me.  I will be able to tell this story, but I’m just one person.  We can all do it.
- Joshua: Thank you Oliver!

*What can we do better next time? How can we improve our next Dream DAO Explorer session?*
