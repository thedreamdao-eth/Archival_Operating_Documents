## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Charlotte

- Fancy works with strategy, community design, and web3 building.  Fancy started with Protein but has now stepped back to found the RADAR community.
- RADAR is part futures agency, part trend accelerator, and part venture studio.
- **What is the futures industry?**  The futures industry does research to gather insight.  They then look for strategy to reach a goal.  All of this leads to foresight - the ability to project scenarios and their implications.
- Problems with the industry include extracted value, not exchanged value.  Good work sits static on clients‚Äô shelves.  Credit and attribution is complicated.  Relationships are transactional, agency life can be siloed, freelancer life can be longely, and there is no true accountability on ‚Äòforecasts.‚Äô
- Community ownership (like with RADAR) can be a solution to these problems.  RADAR wants to be ‚Äúthe first community owned and powered futures engine.‚Äù

- A call to adventure is also important.  It‚Äôs not a purpose/north star - it‚Äôs a mission.
- Intentional churn means setting an MVE and giving people responsibility for their commitment.  You get invaluable feedback when off-boarding inactive members and reduce ghost membership.

- RADAR uses a co-op model.  Token governance will come later.
- RADAR is building and using tools and NFTs.  RADAR is interested in proof of future.
- The community is working on a futures report to get to a collective hypothesis.  This will fuel the Futurethon (a hackathon on steroids) to develop ideas and build prototypes.

## Provocation/Question: Can you elaborate on what you expect the outcome of the Futurthon would be??

- It could be anything.  A community, a piece of clothing, a deck, etc.

## Provocation/Question: How do people join the Futurethon? And how do you become a part of the Radar community?

- We will be putting out info about it soon.  Follow RADAR on Twitter to stay up-to-date.  To become a part of the community, go to the RADAR website.  We have an Airtable to apply.  We try to set up a 1-1 with everyone.

## Provocation/Question: Is this going to be the first Futurethon?

- Yes - the first in the world!  It‚Äôs super ambitious.  I‚Äôll share a sneak peek of a session for you and talk you through it.  (In recording!)

## Provocation/Question: How is value/ownership distributed to the community without financial compensation?

- We do have financial compensation (with briefs).  People are paid for their work, like with the report.  Value is distributed through signal tokens.

## Provocation/Question: Can you talk about the difference between a forwards market and a futures market?

- A futures market is fully focused on behavior and culture.

## Provocation/Question: What's an example of a client + project you would get asked to do as a Futures Agency?

- In the futures industry, there are groups of accelerators that have experience or knowledge of a subject/industry.  They would state that they‚Äôve been using the same reports/data for too long and would ask for updated work.  The agency would then do consumer research and find data to create a product for the client.  The agency can also run futures workshops, etc.
- Government can also be involved.  RADAR was approached by the UK government to think about the future of web3.
