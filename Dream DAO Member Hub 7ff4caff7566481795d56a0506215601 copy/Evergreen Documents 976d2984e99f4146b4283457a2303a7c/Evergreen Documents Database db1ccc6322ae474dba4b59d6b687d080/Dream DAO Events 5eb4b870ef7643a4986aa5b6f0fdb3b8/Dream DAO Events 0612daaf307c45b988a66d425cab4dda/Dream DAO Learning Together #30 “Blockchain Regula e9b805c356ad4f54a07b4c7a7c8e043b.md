- Michele Neitz went to New York University, clerked for a year, and then took on cases related to protecting foster youth.  She now teaches law - Corporate Law and Ethics, Poverty Law, etc.  She got interested in blockchain in 2017 and the regulation surrounding it.  She is the only professor teaching Blockchain Law in her area.
- She wrote a report on non-financial use cases of the blockchain for California a while ago.  However, in Washington D.C., nobody knew about blockchain outside of crypto.  She wanted to change this and was inspired to apply for a grant, starting the Blockchain Law for Social Good Center.
    - The Center‚Äôs goal is to educate people about the technology.
- Trainings were done for government agencies and executives.  Word spread and the demand was high.  The Center is the first of its kind.
- The United States has a system of federalism where laws can be made at any level of government.  It‚Äôs generally carved out who does what - some things are for the states, etc.  However, when dealing with large companies or publicly traded companies, the federal government always gets involved.
- With a new technology, the question of who regulates it emerges.  Will it be the states?  Will it be the federal government?  In this space, one state has gotten ahead and decided to create blockchain policies: Wyoming.  Wyoming has created separate banks, LLCs for DAOs, etc.
    - There‚Äôs a current lawsuit discussing whether a DAO has personal liability or not.
    - California hasn‚Äôt yet made these LLCs okay, and New York has also chosen to protect consumers over attracting business.
- Again, because the federal government has not taken a stance on blockchain regulation, states have taken over.
    - Hawaii requires that when offering tokens, you have to have double the amount in fiat currency that you are going to offer.  It‚Äôs expensive.
    - Texas is trying to copy Wyoming.
- Fran: Is there any chance of a new, purpose built regulator?  Or will this be a CFTC/SEC split?
    - I think the answer is no.  It‚Äôs really difficult to get a new agency at the federal level.  However, a purpose built regulator may be able to happen at the state level.
- Why is this so hard to regulate?  One issue is that it is very hard to define blockchain.  States have individual definitions (California is different from New York, etc.).  If regulators don‚Äôt understand what DLT even is, they can‚Äôt regulate it well.
- Blockchain changes really quickly.  Last year, I was adding NFTs to my class curriculum.  This year, it was DAOs.  What will it be next year?  While this is fun for me, this fast pace is very difficult for regulators.  It‚Äôs low on the radar.
    - The Center is trying to offer a neutral, academic approach to learning about blockchain so that regulators can figure out their positions.
- Elizabeth Warren is a great example of a person that fears crypto scams (like Terra/Luna); education could be fundamental.
- California was overwhelmed with wildfires/COVID after the report was issued, and the legislature couldn‚Äôt do anything.  Then, Biden put out an executive order, and Newsom put out his own order as well (allowing experimentation within state agencies).
    - The executive order tried to strike a balance between innovation and consumer protection.
- California is putting emphasis on its values - environmentalism, etc. -  just like the working group focused on.
- If California gets this wrong, a lot of people will be affected.  It can‚Äôt easily come back like Wyoming if something goes wrong.  It‚Äôs commendable that states are trying things.

## Provocation/Question: How do you see smart contract enforceability?

- Many people believe that courts are the only way to currently resolve smart contract disputes.  I think at the moment, we are looking at traditional enforcement.
- Fran: By saying they need to be figured out in court, do you mean we need to create a cannon of case law?
    - It will happen eventually.  Judge-made law will occur unless legislators step in.

## Provocation/Question: What patterns often occur when the state constructs regulation around new tech? And what can we learn from past mistakes?

- You can go all the way back to the railroads and look at monopoly laws; there is a long history.  Internet laws in the 90s are a really relevant example.  We protected consumers while allowing for innovation.  We allowed failure.  We need to keep talking about equity and values.

## Provocation/Question: Which part of American regulation you see today excites you/ terrifies you?

- I‚Äôm excited to see California‚Äôs policy.  It‚Äôs not as fast as we had originally hoped, but it‚Äôs thoughtful.  The stakeholders are getting a chance to speak.
- It scares me that we may set up a system where nobody is allowed to fail.  We don‚Äôt want to create a world where innovators are afraid.  It would be a mistake to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

## Provocation/Question: What do you think initial steps might look like for bringing web3 education into community colleges? Love this idea, but I can imagine many many challenges.

- Let‚Äôs train the professors.  We don‚Äôt have enough time to create curriculum for each school, but we can train the professors in these web3 topics.  They can then pass that information on.  We can also do conferences.  Currently, we are planning events with a ‚Äúblockchain law for social good‚Äù focus.
- Generally, we just need to go out and educate people.

## Provocation/Question: How can we take inspiration from countries who have been successfully progressive in integrating blockchain into government like in the Netherlands Prince Constantijn van Orange, the technology steward, worked with a bunch of entrepreneurs to expand digital infrastructure in dutch pension funds, etc.?

- We have to remember that these countries are small.  America is never going to follow the Netherlands exactly; we‚Äôre very different.  Let‚Äôs piece together the things that work instead.  We aren‚Äôt going to touch welfare benefits, pension benefits, and other things people rely upon right away.
- Denmark is doing a ‚Äúsafe harbor.‚Äù  Legal obligations are not a burden right away; that could be a really good step.

## Provocation/Question: How do you think you expose the general public to the idea of web3? I feel like your average twitter user knows bored apes and your average dad knows maybe what bitcoin is.

- I don‚Äôt actually think people have almost any knowledge of web3 and the blockchain.  I think we have to really highlight the groups that are doing social good.  Our Center is doing spotlights for blockchain projects doing good things.
