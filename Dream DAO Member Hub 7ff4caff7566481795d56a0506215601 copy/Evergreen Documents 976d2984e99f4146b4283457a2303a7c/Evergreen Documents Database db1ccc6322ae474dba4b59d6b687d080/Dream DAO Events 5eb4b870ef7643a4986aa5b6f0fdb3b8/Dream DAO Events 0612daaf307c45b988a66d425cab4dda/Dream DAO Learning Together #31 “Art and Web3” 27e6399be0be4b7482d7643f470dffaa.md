## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Charlotte

- I worked on Spider-Man video game (PS5 for Miles Morales).
    - However, it was not the right fit for the impact I wanted to have on the world.
- I’d heard about crypto but didn’t know too much about it… I quit my job and fell down the crypto rabbithole.
- I joined Gitcoin and worked on making comic characters 3D.
    - **I made SkywalkerZ 3D!!!**
- Art Process:
    - I start with a (digital) ball of clay and sketch onto it.
    - I can use certain tools - to keep symmetry, etc.
    - I do a lot of this initial work in virtual reality (to keep perspective in three dimensions).
    - Another advantage of digital work is the ability to duplicate work to move more quickly (using building blocks together).
    - I can use motion capture data to make 3D characters move.
- One of the big questions in public goods right now is on how we can attract people (even though the market is tanking).  We can do a lot to make social causes more fun and more engaging.
    - I’m working on that with characters right now.
- Ash Kranti: I got into digital art recently.  Someone was generous enough to donate the technology for me to succeed.  I’ve been using digital art to disconnect from technology.  Even though it *is* technology, it’s very peaceful, and I like being able to create things and relax.
    - Colton: The true utility of art and the creative process is what you are touching on here.  I love that you said we don’t have to mint things for them to have value to us.  It’s just an amazing experience.
- Amanda: I’ve tried Blender.  It was so slow, I distanced myself from it, but I want to go back.
- Dariel: I’m also learning with my brother and trying things out.
- AI art is really interesting as well.  It’s really exciting for me as a creator to see more and more people becoming involved.  Pollinations is a great program to try out.

## Provocation/Question: Have you tried product design?  Fusion360?

- My brother has done some work with it.  I don’t tend to use it a lot; it’s so precise (down to the mm), and I just make things look good.

## Provocation/Question: Would you say more (character) artists are moving to Web3, or is it still rare?

- It’s still uncommon.
- Raf Grassetti is a Web3 character artist.

## Provocation/Question: How did you get the Miles Morales job?

- I went to a talk by a guy who did a podcast I listened to.  I introduced myself afterwards and we stayed in touch.  I got my foot in the door that way (and had a professor who put in a good word).  Then, I had one piece that  really did well in school.  It ended up on the cover of a 3D art magazine.
- You have to have a certain level of artistic ability, but you also need to be nice and good to work with.

## Provocation/Question: What is the Web3 art trajectory?  What’s it like being an artist right now?

- I know a lot of established artists, but I would imagine that a lot of artists are going back to web2 with the bear market.
- We are going to find out which NFTs are useful with this bear market.  Art is the cherry on top - I bought a SkywalkerZ because of the mission behind the Dream DAO, not the art.
- People are using NFTs to hold intellectual property, etc.  NFTs don’t have to be art; art was just a form that became quickly popular.

## Provocation/Question: What free apps or tools do you recommend for people beginning with 3D art?

- This is where I go back to VR.  The Oculus Quest 2 is like $300, and Google’s tilt brush is about $20-$30.  The amount of fun I’ve seen non-artists have immediately with these tools is incredible.  That’s what I would recommend in the beginning.

## Provocation/Question: Web2 vs. Web3 art jobs - what are the differences in culture and vibes?

- Web3 is a lot more entrepreneurial.  The culture is good.  One downside is that work is a lot more inconsistent; now that the market is down, it’s a lot more difficult to find a way forward.  I’m here for the mission, not the commission.  But, I wouldn’t blame anyone for making a different choice.

## Provocation/Question: How did you learn to create 3D art?

- I went to college without knowing how to do 3D art - that set me apart, and I felt totally out of my league.  My fundamental art ended up paying off, but for years I felt like people were speeding ahead.  Nothing clicked for me until I started character sculpting.  My advisors told me not to try to be a character artist; nobody gets that job right out of school.  But, I knew I had to go with it.  I fell in love with it and thought it was a great way to express meaningful stories.
