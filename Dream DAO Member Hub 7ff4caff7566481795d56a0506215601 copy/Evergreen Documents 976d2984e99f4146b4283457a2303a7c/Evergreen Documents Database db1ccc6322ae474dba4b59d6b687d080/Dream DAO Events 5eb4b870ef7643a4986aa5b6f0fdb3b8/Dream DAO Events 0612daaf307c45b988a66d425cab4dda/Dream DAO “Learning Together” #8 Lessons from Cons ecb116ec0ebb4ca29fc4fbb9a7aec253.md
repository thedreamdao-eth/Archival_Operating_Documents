## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Charlotte

- Rapid mobilization - quickly got thousands of people involved to raise millions of dollars.  Clear alignment of incentives and clear strategy.
    - ‚ÄúWe are going to buy the Constitution.‚Äù
- ConstitutionDAO was inspired by an article mentioning the Constitution was for sale.  Approached it from a web3 perspective; a DAO, smart contract, etc. was necessary.
- People wanted to do something ‚Äúcool and outrageous.‚Äù  They came together in the organization, which had major ideas of inclusivity.  The large financial cost meant getting people with resources on board.  Crypto/web3 organizers and influencers got involved.
    - Metaphorical wave of decentralization
- Complexity can be an enemy.  It‚Äôs difficult to get people rallied and motivated when something is difficult to understand.

Prof Stam: I donated to ConstitutionDAO and loved it.  What legal and ownership issues would have come up if the ConstutionDAO succeeded?  It didn‚Äôt happen but could have been a stress test.

- ConstitutionDAO was going to make it a public good.  Structurally, there were advantages.  Legalities are very difficult in a lot of these groups.  ConstitutionDAO would still have run into a lot of challenges, although a lot of them seemed possible to overcome.
    - Endaoment helps crypto people make public donations and deal with legal issues.
- One of ConstitutionDAO‚Äôs largest assets was quick mobilization and coordination.  Entering an auction in one week created interest and gathered funds.
- Decentralization of decisions is difficult.  Consensus is hard in large groups.  Sometimes, decentralization can remove autonomy.  Giving people trust in specific areas was beneficial.
    - Important for community to be informed on large decisions
    - Clear communication is extremely important

David: In the nonprofit space, there's a dynamic where a lot of funds are raised as a result of a crisis or an emergency. That's why you see an influx of funds when there's a tsunami or a humanitarian crisis, but not so much when you have a chronic situation.  Do you always need a burning platform to mobilize people? What do you do when there is a need to address the chronic issues?

- This is a difficult issue to answer.  There is a deep need in society to support ‚Äúheroism.‚Äù  It‚Äôs better to save and stop fires than make sure the fire never burns in the first place.  We can look at this from multiple perspectives, including public health.  Wouldn‚Äôt it be easy to provide nutrition and preventative care? Etc.
- Retroactive funding asks, ‚ÄúInstead of funding what we think will be helpful, can we fund quantitatively useful things?‚Äù  This often comes down to one person - I wish it was easier to get public support on this.

Ethan: Do you have a time frame where you think ConstitutionDAO could've been more successful (maybe because of thinking through obstacles or fundraising time?)

- I‚Äôm not sure it would have worked better in a different time frame.  For example, thinking through L2s would have been useful.
- A lot of people contributed to ConstitutionDAO.  At least 15 were key players in ensuring ConstitutionDAO got to auction.  The best ideas and best execution of the ideas came when I asked for help and didn‚Äôt fear other people taking the idea.  Anyone could contribute.
    - It‚Äôs awesome to learn in public.

Ethan: In hindsight, is there anything you learned managing the ConstitutionDAO community? Specifically, on the topic of small fires vs. long-term goals, any ideas on steering a DAO in a certain direction without a centralized plan (especially with a small core team but a large community like yours)?

- In hindsight, we should have had better messaging about the plans after winning or losing the auction.
- Something cool about the compressed timeframe was that only the most important items were being taken care of.  The 80% that didn‚Äôt matter wasn‚Äôt done; the most crucial parts were.
    - Ethan: Parkinson‚Äôs Law - work fills to expand time given to it
        - Yes.  I am a productive procrastinator, doing the 80%.  We have to do the burdensome things; they have to be the top priority.

Oliva-Velez: Other than Endaoment, which other tools/partners were key to ConstitutionDAO's success?Conversely, was there any you would have avoided next time?

- We used Juicebox, Endaoment, Syndicate DAO, and worked with partners and stakeholders.  We were going to take the Constitution to Federal Hall.
- For communication, we used Discord and Twitter.  Had a thoughtful and compelling media campaign getting into news organizations.
- Everything we used was necessary.  If I were to do it again, I would use Layer 2s, which Juicebox doesn‚Äôt exist on.
- These days, there are more groups and tools to help, especially on Mainnet.  More and more tooling is evolving, but we are still in the early stages.

Prof Stam: How do we, as a web3 community, respond or teach people about certain groups?  How do we avoid only negative stories getting out?

- People are going to be detractors no matter what.  They are going to find reasons to take down your movement.  You have to be comfortable and confident with what you are doing.
    - I felt comfortable because every step along the way, we took the best, most ethical approaches.  People knew what they were getting into.  When people went to contribute, they saw information on gas fees, etc.  Should we have done more?  Yes.  Did we do our best?  Yes.
- ConstitutionDAO raised a lot of money in a short time for a public good; something that could be used and viewed by all.  What other goods require a minimum threshold that money could be pooled for?
    - We can try our best.  If it doesn‚Äôt work out, the money can be returned. = Purity of ConstitutionDAO.
        - You don‚Äôt always have to force yourselves to move forward.  Organizations can be temporary if they want to be, despite an innate desire to have things last forever.
        - ConstitutionDAO moved forward because we all had interests to pursue.

Oliva-Velez: Was the fact ConstitutionDAO was a DAO important to its development and success?

- Theoretically, other forms of fundraising could have worked.  However, the fact we used crypto made it novel.  If we were to do it today, ConstitutionDAO wouldn‚Äôt be new, and impact might be different.
    - Still, transferring money with crypto is hard.  There were barriers to it.
- There were a number of people on the team that were complete strangers to me.  Alignment is idea, but it can also be small and temporary.  When you want to do something long-term, you need to find people that have very similar visions and ideas.
    - People in ConstitutionDAO were aligned.  Civil conversations and agreements were common.  People worked with the group, even if they personally did not always agree.

Gary: How has your involvement in ConstitutionDAO changed your life?

- I didn‚Äôt expect to get thrust into the center stage of crypto world.  Crypto was only a portion of my job beforehand.  ConstitutionDAO gave me confidence to engage fully.

Emmani: You mentioned during your lecture how motivating others is hard if something is difficult to understand. how did you and your team tackle this issue and help others understand crypto/constitutionDAOs goals?

- The execution was complicated.  The message we communicated to participants was clear and simple.  Core contributors had to understand the nuances; the broader community needed information that was accessible.
- Understanding crypto is very difficult.  People like having their hand held, going step-by-step through the process.

Ethan: One thing that I found interesting was the whole debacle with pulling out money and how some people weren't able to do it? I would love to hear how big this problem was from the your perspective and how you learned from it

- The only money that couldn‚Äôt be withdrawn was money that was less than the gas fees to take it.  The lesson here was for the future - to think about L2s with lower gas fees.

Oliver: Did you learn any practices with ConstitutionDAO for building closely mission-aligned communities or communicating the goals of the community?

- It‚Äôs never bad to keep repeating ideas.  (Especially with Discord, where information disappears.)  Don‚Äôt assume that people are listening or reading everything.

Ahyun: Do you think ConstitutionDAO could be a model for other DAOs to adopt when starting something similar? Though there are quirks about each DAO and differences in goals, what do you think are some major lessons or aspects that they could imitate or modify?

- Something I loved about ConstitutionDAO was that none of us had to be full-time.  Nobody quit their jobs.  Minimum commitment can gauge interest in small amounts of time.

## Reflections and Takeaways (10 mins)

*What is one thing you learned from this lecture + conversation? What new questions did you develop during this session?*

- Ethan: One thing I learned was definitely about the influence of luck and simplicity and how impactful that was for ConstitutionDAO's success.
- Emmani: Certain concepts that are considered ‚Äúgood‚Äù can actually have a negative impact. For example, how decentralization (something considered to be a positive) can be considered complicative in terms of getting things done with a majority due to having more people involved.
- Oliver: I really enjoyed hearing about clearly communicating a simple message for mobilizing communities. Also, being open to any big ideas and giving people permission to explore things and then bring them back to the group when needed.
- Ahyun: This was a very insightful session- I realised that there is a whole story behind ConstitutionDAO's success and this could be a threshold for new possibilities for other DAOs. Simplicity, clarity, efficiency, commitment, risk-taking, and vision. It was really interesting!
- Angelina: It still amazes me how much DAO experiences can teach us about personal organisation and community building in general (e.g. when it comes to priorization, motivating people etc.)

*What can we do better next time? How can we improve our next session?* 

- Oliva-Velez: Future review of the Dream DAO with speakers?  Targeted questions in advance.
- Aditya: Not a lot of people joined today, was that because of the day/time?
- Emmani: This is a weird one, but having the speakers ask us questions back! I feel like it would be really awesome and an interesting take, would really emphasize ‚Äúlearning together‚Äù as well.
