## Provocation/Question: In the past, our environment was more accommodating of slow-adjusting movements.  Now, we move at a faster pace.  How do you balance this?

- It‚Äôs tough.  You have to develop nuance but also catch attention.  It takes time to develop the skill of argumentation.
- Jae-Hee: There has to be some coherence around the story.  Is there a DAO/crypto writer community?
- I‚Äôm in a community within a DAO of writers, but we don‚Äôt have something broader.

## Provocation/Question: What is your hottest take on the space?

- Hierarchies still exist in DAOs.  People outside the space may question this, but it‚Äôs true, and people inside DAOs recognize this.
- Soft hierarchies exist based on tenure, activity, and skills.
- DAOs don‚Äôt just eliminate hierarchies.  There are just different forms of them.

## Provocation/Question: Where do you see the future of web3 jargon?  Will it become more useful?  Will we abandon it?

- It‚Äôs an example of signaling that you are a part of the group.  Using crypto language shows that you are deep into the space.  The crypto/anti-crypto spaces are already divided, and language exacerbates the split.
- I think there is language that will die off.  For example, ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù and ‚Äúhash rates.‚Äù  Things like DAOs may still be useful.

## Provocation/Question: How do you deal with such a rapidly changing space?

- Doing research on Twitter is, weirdly, super helpful.  A lot happens on Twitter that doesn‚Äôt make it into publications.
- I look at *a lot* of analytics.
- I often join the Discord platforms of groups I‚Äôm writing about, and again, interviews are important.

## Provocation/Question: How do you balance differences between the ideals and structures of a community?

- There is definitely a difference between the ideals of a DAO and what actually happens.  It‚Äôs a tough question.  I like to do a lot of interviews to actually figure out what is going on.  People love to share about their DAOs.
- Definitely reach out to people to figure out how to balance it.

## Provocation/Question: Do you feel like there are better ways to make money in this field?

- Writing for products and user experience, definitely.  It‚Äôs writing-adjacent and requires a bit more marketing knowledge, but it is a higher-paying field.
- Technical writing is also in demand.  Working with developers to write whitepapers and documentation is high-paying as well.

## Provocation/Question: What advice do you have for people looking for to enter web3 and writing?

- Join a DAO.  Take a literature class or a writing class if you are in college.  Read the books I recommended!  Start a habit of writing.

## Provocation/Question: Are you at your ideal job?  Where else do you want to go?

- I want to dive more into DAO writing.  My goal is to officially jump into writing for a company or organization that works with DAOs and DAO tooling.

## Provocation/Question: What led you to this intersection of web3 and writing?

- Ever since I was a kid, I knew I liked writing.  I didn‚Äôt know if I could pursue it as an actual career, though.  In college, I dabbled and did some political science, but I still liked English more.  Getting into writing for crypto was different.  I was hearing about it in the news and listened to some podcasts on it.
- It‚Äôs important to have writers - this space needs more writers.

## Provocation/Question: Do you ever have your friends read your drafts?

- Sometimes.  I‚Äôll let my boyfriend read my drafts.  However, Bankless DAO has editors, and they often read over my writing.

## Provocation/Question: How do you make sure your writing is understandable, especially to people outside of web3?

- That‚Äôs a hard question, and it‚Äôs one we are constantly trying to figure out.  As you get deeper into writing about crypto, it gets more difficult to situate yourself in a beginner‚Äôs shoes.  I practice speaking to other people.
- If you write a piece introducing people to crypto, remove yourself from it for a few days.  Look at it with fresh eyes and a fresh perspective.

## Provocation/Question: Where is your current focus while writing?  What do you write?

- I focus on DAOs, mainly.  I do a lot of opinion and think pieces on how we can make DAOs better and solve human coordination problems.  There‚Äôs an area of sociology and pyschology that I like to look at.
- Bankless DAO brings people into crypto, which I am a part of.  I also write a lot of internal newsletters for the group.

## Provocation/Question: Is it common to write for multiple newsletters or publications at the same time?

- When you are building a portfolio, it‚Äôs nice to have a variety of options at once.  A lot of groups have a large group of writers with a rotation.
