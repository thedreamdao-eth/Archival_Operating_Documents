## Provocation/Question: What is your vision?

- Jae-Hee: I work with the Dream DAO, but I will also be working with Celo’s Climate Collective and Protein DAO this summer.  I want to work in places that focus on ethical dignity.  I come from Civics Unplugged, where values of leadership and humanity were prioritized.  I don’t want to tolerate “necessary evils.”
- Gary: I want to contribute to human flourishing and help reserve humanity’s downward spiral.  I want impact work to become the default, cool thing to do in web3.
    - Aya: I always recommend keeping things simple and communicating clearly - people don’t always have the longest attention spans.
- Madhav: I read the book you mentioned.
- Ash: I want to bring new groups into systems.  Mainly, I’m solving for joy and embracing the things that make me happy.
- Saf: I’ve been accessing a sense of urgency in my work.  We don’t have time to wait to save the planet, etc.  It’s really easy to use, but it’s not sustainable.  I’m working on finding reasoning that is rooted and will last longer.
- Madison: Mass-scale storytelling needs to happen.  I want to be able to show my family and my friends some form of content for an hour that can bring them in to web3 and help them understand.  I want to create a caring and loving culture.
- Karl: I’m more of a dreamer, but in these communities, we can take collective action.

## Provocation/Question: What are your thoughts on the intersections of storytelling and web3?  What are the biggest gaps?

- Aya: I like telling stories instead of describing something with just a few words or one big number.  You have to describe the human connections and philosophies in the system.  Storytelling helps inspire people and share the vision; it’s really important.  A gap, however, is that some people just want the information quickly.
    - On Twitter, if someone shares a reading, people click “like” without *really* reading.
    - I’m still looking for the best way to share a message, myself.

## Provocation/Question: What is the Infinite Garden?

- Aya: Infinite Garden is being used to describe Ethereum.  Finite thinking is like playing a game for the purpose of winning, while infinite thinking is like playing a game for the purpose of continuing play.  The “Garden” represents biodiversity; we are co-exisitng and playing together.
    - It’s a vision.
    - A Vision = Your “Why”
