Notes by Charlotte

- Elliot grew up as a typical North American kid; when he was exposed to injustice, he joined groups and protested.  Overall, he realized systems were the issue.
- How do we unite humanity?
- We need to build a platform that can unite us and change the culture around it
    - Ecosystem of platforms
    - Movement-building strategy
- Principles of success for society should mirror success for individuals
- SocietyOS - a crowdsourced civilization design platform that proposes and funds specific projects that align with the vision of a better world
- Purpose-based Metaverse
    - We regenerate the Earth and achieve the best world possible
    - We work with the Earth
- The Meaning Economy - monetizing meaning
    - If you do good, you are rewarded
    - Facilitated through the blockchain

## Provocation/Question: Is there utility in uniting humanity?  How would you go about it?  What excites you in impact/web3 spaces?

- Madhav: Do we have a concrete vision of what we want to work on when we unite humanity?
- Elliot: What I want to work on doesn‚Äôt matter.  What matters is that we can get together and share *all* of our visions and make change.  And currently, we aren‚Äôt able to do that.  Coordination is a great frame, but it can be used in dangerous ways.  We need coordinate for intention before activity.  ‚ÄúThe strongest purpose is the one that gets the leader and the people to all look in the same direction.‚Äù
- Shaan: You mentioned *The Art of War*, and recently, I‚Äôve been learning about Ancient East civilizations.  The one thing that maybe they got wrong was that there were inherent assumptions about the nature of people - that they were good, for example.  We need to think about how we can extract the specific good ideas of the past to build a better future.
- Elliot: You can be a good person, and the system can lead you in a bad direction.  Can we create a system that avoids this?  If you‚Äôre a bad person, can you be incentivized to do the right thing?  Can we not mobilize the people that want to do good to create these changes?
- Shaan: We have metrics, but they aren‚Äôt implemented on a large scale (GDP, happiness index, etc.).
    - Elliot: We need find a way to balance Earth‚Äôs needs and human needs.  Homo Gaia is a purpose-based metaverse to take important metrics and actually use them.
- Elliot: We want to create new systems and then transition from the old.  We don‚Äôt want to destroy what we have right now.
- Shaan: Do you think some people don‚Äôt want to be part of a global community?
    - Elliot: Absolutely - and we want to support that.  A global community just provides a base layer of support.

## Provocation/Question: What was your journey towards this?

- Elliot: My background is in martial arts.  I take a philosophical approach.  In my work, I‚Äôve found that it‚Äôs important to turn problems into questions.  My work was taking time from systems work.  The virus of light came out of this - spreading over time.  COVID-19 gave me time to work on systems as my business shut down.
- I went onto Clubhouse and met others who cared about impact.  I was exposed to a whole new group of people.  Originally, I spent a lot of time listening, but eventually, I hosted rooms.  ‚ÄúChangemakers United‚Äù provided a way for people to discuss and get help.
- I continued going to events like ETHDenver and other meetings.  Going to spaces with people making an impact was super important.
