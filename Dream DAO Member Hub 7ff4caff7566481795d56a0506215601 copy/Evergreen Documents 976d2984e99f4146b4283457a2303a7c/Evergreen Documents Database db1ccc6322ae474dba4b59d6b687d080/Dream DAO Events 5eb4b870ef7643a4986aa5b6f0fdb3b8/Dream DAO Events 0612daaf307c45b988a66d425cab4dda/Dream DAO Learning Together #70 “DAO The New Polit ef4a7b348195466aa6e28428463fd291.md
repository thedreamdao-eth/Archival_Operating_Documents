Notes by <Fernando>

### Zane Huffman - Host of Learning Together Session 👱🏻‍♂️

Zane Huffman is 24 years old. He is the founder of Governor DAO which is a collective that helps other people to do decentralization in a better way. With Governor DAO, Zane has helped with projects, smart contracts, and engineering, as creating some products with the objective of helping DAOs in descentral projects to operate better. Also, Zane is the Chief Strategy Officer at @Bloq (a consensus umbrella organization) where he has done some Head of Strategy DeFi work. Finally, Zane hosted these Learning Together Session in which he talked about the ability of DAOs to reshape the way in which we interact and do business in the same way.

**What is Zane’s Story? 📕**

Before we talked about the main topic, Zane shared with us a little bit about his story and the beginning of his journey through the web3 intersection.

Zane entered the crypto space at a very young age. Since he was very young, he was interested in making money alive and playing video games in which the economy was important. In his free time, he discovered how to do trading and speculate on the crypto market as a child through Roblox and its virtual economy system. Subsequently, he discovered Bitcoin in 2013 on the Bitcoin Minecraft Casino, Zane was getting people to enter the server and he discovered many economic opportunities that led him to the crypto space.

### Talking about Economy 💸

To start the Lecture, Zane shared that through his pretty soon crypto journey, he started to recognize that there were more radical implications than just making money without the necessity of other people knowing who he was or how old he was. Zane recognizes that very early in the crypto space there were strong **Economy Virtues** like:

- A low barrier at the entrance.
- A global workforce.
- Close proximity to the capital.
- Sovereignty over assets.

On the other hand, Zane also shared that outside crypto there are some **other opportunities** taking place, so as **similar global developments** such as:

- Creator Economy.
- E-Sports.
- Startups/Tech Industry.
- Gig Economy.

But these either opportunities and global developments have similar inefficiencies such as:

- Rent-seeking behaviors.
- Predatory practices.
- Top-Down approach. (Shareholders Profit Most)

### What is the problem with the Economy? 💭

After talking about the Economy, Zane told that the problem with the economy is that the current economic system implemented in most parts of the world (Capitalism) isn’t perfect; neither is Socialism, the other economic system implemented in the world.

At this point, Zane encourages us to open our minds in order to make a Stage-Setting in which we can:

- Alleviate preconceived connotations or biases about Capitalism/Socialism.
- Refrain from “pro-capitalist or “anti-capitalist” framing/rhetoric.
- Reposition our thinking that Capitalism and Socialism are not the only models that can exist.

**What is the world we live in? 🤔**

To achieve what Zane mentioned before, he told us that first, we need to understand how the world works currently. Something important to understand is that the global economy is dominated by:

1. Free Market Capitalism, which represents a system that has:
- Independent and rational actors compete in an open market.
- Firms that will fill the needs of the market, as the market demands them.
- Products and services are dominated by corporations that minimize their marginal cost to produce.

On the other hand, we have:

1. Marxist Assessment, which establishes that:
- Capitalism is a relationship between Capitalists (who control the production) and Laborers (who execute the production)
- Laborers are the ones who work, and the Capitalists keep all the profit.

**What is the problem? ❗**

The problem with having Capitalism as the dominant economic system is that this system is inequitable, however, it doesn’t care.

Zane share with us what was the idea of correcting the Capitalism System, with the Socialist Model, which establishes that:

- There will be just one role: the worker.
- The worker role will absorb both laborer and capitalism responsibilities, with the objective of seizing the means of production and keeping the fruits of labor.

This model proposed something equitable, however, the reality of this model showed that:

- Efficiency matters more than equity in competition. At this point, Capitalism wins.

Anyway, when we talk about a perfect mechanism, we can suppose that a capitalist killer must be more efficient, and a better tomorrow must be more equitable. But the question here is:

**HOW ARE WE ACHIEVING THIS?**

### What is the possible solution? (DAOs) ✅

Now at this point of the Learning Together Session, we arrive at the important fact for us, what is the answer to our current economic models? 

Zane share with us that the possible answer and solution to the problem mentioned above would be DAOs. He points out that a Decentralized Autonomous Organization can be the solution since they can be loosely categorized as:

- Decentralized Enrollment.
- Open Participation.
- Incentive Aligned Contributor ship.
- Governed by Members.
- Enforced by Code.

Summarizing everything, in regular human terms, with DAOs, free individuals opt-in to work towards the shared vision they collectively own.

**How does the DAO is compared with the Corporation? 🆚**

The topic of discussion of this LT is based on how DAOs are compared with Corporations. For a potential DAO future to exist into prosper, the DAO has to be better than a Corporation, and now there are some comparators that demonstrate the efficiency of DAOs against Corporations, which are:

- Automated Administration > Managers and Executives.
- Self-Governance > Board of Directors.
- Enforcement via Code > Human Middlemen.

But also, DAOs are not better just in efficiency, but also they want to achieve equity, and that is where we can point out the improvement against current models. DAOs have equity in the way that:

- Participants are opt-in to a shared goal.
- They tokenized ownership as involvement.
- They are directly incentivized for good work done.

### DAOs Today 📅

Today we have examples of DAOs like:

1. Investment DAOs 💰
- Members contribute capital.
- Shared responsibility to invest advantageously.

1. Service DAOs 🗣️
- Members offer skills and expertise.
- Shared responsibility to engage clients and perform services.

1. Community DAOs 🚀
- Members foster relationships with one another.
- Shared responsibility to build “social capital”.

### Learning Together Session Stuff 💡

## Provocation/Question: How would be your recommendation for new DAOs to manage their governance in the best way possible?

- My recommendation is to define your goals, your values, your members, and your priorities, and with that information clear, governance can do a good job.

## Provocation/Question: How are people contributing and getting rewarded on a DAOs structure?

- 

## Provocation/Question: Do you consider the DAOs structure can be a possible system for society?

- I consider there are examples today, there are some communities that operate in a different way part of Capitalism and Socialism. I consider that if DAO is implemented in society DAOs should be able to be a great system that can work as a corporation.
