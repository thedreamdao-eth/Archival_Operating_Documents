Distinct, inseparable and interchangable

Body - Imminent

Mind - omniscient

Spirit - Transcendent

They aren‚Äôt paired together but are put together in an artistic way to create an essence to what they are. 

Rational is omniscient, and irrational is transcendent

The platinum rule - treat others as they like to be treated

Metaphysics is a tool to understanding

The imminent is more fundamental is in every situation (transcendent and omniscient have interactions)

Creation is transcendent 

Music (interaction between creation (transcendent) and MP3 (omniscient)

Care is really important. As soon as money becomes a motivator or a factor, it becomes difficult to keep the community alive. Alterior motives rather than true care and love. 

Money became a huge motivator and has the ability to change group dynamics

## Provocation/Question: Studying culture through the perspective of the metaphysical

- Culture - imminent
- Vision - omniscient
- Strategy - transcendent
- Create a vision ‚Üí manipulate a culture ‚Üí culture begets anything
- In for example Indian culture, deep culture, norms would be vision
- Culture is love
- Indians to go all over the world and become doctors ‚Üí build a rigorous school system

## Provocation/Question: How does the omniscient and transcendent justify unethical actions?

- It shouldn‚Äôt
- Religion should essentially be love
- It should be a human decision (ethics)
- All-win choice
- If there is only win or lose, woudl trigger survival instincts
- The context has to shift, context has to do with mental models, etc

## Provocation/Question: How did you come across this idea?

- The way civilisation is right now, how unhealthy it is.
- Podcasts about [http://jcl.pub/pods](http://jcl.pub/pods)
- The most nutrient dense reading

<aside>
üí° It‚Äôs like a sponge

## Provocation/Question: Explaining divine presences

- The interaction is imminent. The transcendent of angels. Memory of the experience is omniscient
- Frames experiences in a way that makes sense
- Hyperagent - focusing attention, in our consciousness
- A hyperagent has different selves and people that propogate the meme/belief
- Facts can be true but the truth cannot be a fact
- Open-mindedness at its core is the ability to view reality in 3D
- Multidimensional beings
- Non-dual to dual

üí° Liminal DAO - A DAO that‚Äôs not a DAO (mission - to dissolve the metacrisis)
Metacrisis is noticing all the other things are in crisis (capitalism, power)
