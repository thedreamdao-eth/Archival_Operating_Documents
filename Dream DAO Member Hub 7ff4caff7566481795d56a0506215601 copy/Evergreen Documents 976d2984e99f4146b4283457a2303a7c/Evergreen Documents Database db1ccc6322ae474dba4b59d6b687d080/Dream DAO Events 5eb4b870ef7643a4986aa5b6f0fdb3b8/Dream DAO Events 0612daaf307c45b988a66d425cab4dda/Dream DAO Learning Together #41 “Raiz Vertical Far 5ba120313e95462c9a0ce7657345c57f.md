## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Charlotte

- Raiz is a vertical farming solution based in Lisbon.  Raiz is attempting to tackle food agriculture issues.  Being in a big city, and not being able to access or afford local vegetables is a problem.
- Our food system is broken.  33% of food is wasted.  47% of emissions are related to agriculture.  Etc‚Ä¶
- Vertical farming is controlled environment agriculture.  With algorithms and sensors, we can produce higher consistency, quality, and yields.  All this can happen while using 90% less water and 95% less land.
- In Raiz‚Äôs farm in Lisbon, which launched recently, there are many, many plants.  Solar glass and solar panels are used, and there is an eating area.  Currently, basil is a prominent part of the farm.
- Raiz is planning to tokenize.  Each farm will have 1000 shares.  Currently, there are Plant NFTs.  Sustainability is still a key factor, so carbon credits may be used later.
- Raiz uses NEAR Protocol.  NEAR has regenerative, carbon-neutral aspects.
- Raiz has been asked to build more farms in Lisbon and wants to expand throughout Europe.  Raiz has also been asked to do lecture series and spread awareness of the work.  Raiz will have an individual stall at NEARcon.

## Provocation/Question: What is the rough cost of a Raiz farm?  What is the model for Raiz?

- There isn‚Äôt an exact figure for the cost of a Raiz farm; I would put it somewhere around 30-50k.  If you buy a share of the farm, you are then within the DAO (in creation) and have influence.  Every token holder can also generate profit from Raiz‚Äôs success.  We are still developing our exact model - there aren‚Äôt other groups like us.

## Provocation/Question: Are there limitations with vertical farming?

- There are.  Things that grow on trees, like apples, are more challenging.  I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre impossible to grow, but they do need to be worked out.  Berries and greens are currently easier.

## Provocation/Question: How can Raiz be supported?

- People are always welcome to ask how they can help.  Raiz is planning to develop a program to introduce people as moderators.  The team is small, and the community is looking to grow.  *The most important part right now is building the community.*
