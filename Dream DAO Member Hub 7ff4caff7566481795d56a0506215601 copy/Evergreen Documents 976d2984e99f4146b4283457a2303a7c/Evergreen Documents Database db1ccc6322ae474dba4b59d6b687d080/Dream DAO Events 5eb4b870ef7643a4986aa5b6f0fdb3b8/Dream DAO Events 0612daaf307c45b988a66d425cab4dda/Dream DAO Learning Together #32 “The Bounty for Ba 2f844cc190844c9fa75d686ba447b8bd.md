Use Blockchain tech to create bounty out of “Basura” (Garbage in Filipino)

Gauri: A lot of a people in the developing world face the problem of physical cash (basically lack of flexibility in financial incentives and usage)

Madison: I wonder if it were difficult for people to convert it into local currency.

Jaynie:  I love how they thought about reducing Carbon emissions, and that people get to reap and actively own their responsibility as a collective

💡 Blockchain is _________

</aside>

Karl/Arman: This is an amazing example of asset-based community development.

Madison: Something I wonder about is the largest benefit of what people miss out on, is that people buy financial assets (digital ones) as a storage of value and  NOT as a means of value.

Aditya: The Web3 way of channeling money directly to the stakeholders is FAR more decentralized and less mediated than the Traditional system of “Trickle Down” embedded with a ton of intermediaries (aka middlemen).

**Eliza-** I thought Basura was a name of a place, jokes apart I feel this is a great project however I am not sure about how well known the approach of this is across different sections of the world. There is still a degen narrative around the notion of crypto amongst people. Ensuring a healthier narrative  + making an impact is crucial.

**Madison-** Proof of work itself needs someone who can verify it, ensuring their availability is crucial

Gauri- Making people aware + digitizing + desensitizing the economy from the crypto stigma can be one of the first steps.

**Jaynie-** We should think about how the folks would have access to tech in the face of this.

**Rashmika-** Keeping tech aside, I feel that the people can still benefit if they know the ground-level workings.

**Angelina-** Gamification is key. I came across a company that has specialized in it + made processes that many people do not really want to do. It adds a component of competition, incentivizes collective action and I feel this is a great example. The company I checked out was- Pfeffermind (based in Berlin). They are working on gamification of different school lessons and creating workshops on security and workplace guidelines.

Karl/Arman: Gamification is an amazing tool that if used well can greatly help in increasing the understanding of crypto. 

Madison: People don’ buy crypto as an exchange of value, mostly as a storage of value. Most people promise money in USD, convert it to ETH (despite knowing fluctuation in prices).

## Provocation/Question: How do we find an intersection between people using it as an exchange of value + maximizing the potential of social impact by blockchain

- Aditya- I think that making stable coins “stable” is one of the kickstarters for this
- Madison-
- Kunal- How do we peg / work around stable coins
- Aditya- We peg stable coins’ value with USD in general. Even if someone were to withdraw all their stable coins, they’d get the USD value. The terra luna disaster happened because of lack of stability in the pegging algorithms itself. As a result we observe price instability to the extent that market economies crash.

## Provocation/Question: What crypto conditions do we need to look out for in order to have a sustainable process for this

- Whether people gain access to pay and use the crypto for their daily operations
- Angelina: Whether the new tools of communication (especially that of awareness and information) are available so that they work while being cognizant of ensuring directions aren’t one-sided. Ensuring the sustainability of the process involves explaining the basics of what allows the systems to exist. It is as necessary as having tools to apply on a daily basis
- Eliza:
- If multiple breakouts
