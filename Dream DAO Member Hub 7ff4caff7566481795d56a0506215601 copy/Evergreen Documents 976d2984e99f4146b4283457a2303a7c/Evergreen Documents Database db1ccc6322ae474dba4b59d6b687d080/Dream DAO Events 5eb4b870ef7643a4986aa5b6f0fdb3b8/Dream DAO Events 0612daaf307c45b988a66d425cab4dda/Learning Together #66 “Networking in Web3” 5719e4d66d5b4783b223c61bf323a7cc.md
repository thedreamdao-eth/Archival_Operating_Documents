### 3 Rules to build community in web3

2. Fostering: Fostering and caring for your relationships
3. Value: Providing and receiving value

- Values aligned
- Interesting
- Kind/ welcoming

### Why build community with people you actually like?

- More Value
- Integrity
- Long-term

### How to find people you actually like

- Twitter: post and reply to people in web3 x social impact(Example: askin questions about certain terms you dont understand and people can answer and you share perspectives)
- Events: attending online and IRL events

> Relationship are like gardens, care for them non-transactional ways.                                                                  Madison Adams

### Non-transactional ways to foster a relationship

- Ask when their birthday is, wish them happy birthday.
- When you see/read/hear something that reminds you of them, let them know.
- Share experiences, like food and games.
- Ask about their non-work life and interests.
- Have occasional catch-up calls.

### Value Exchange

- Add Value: There is almost always a way you can help someone.
- Receive value: when you add value, value will come back to you.

### Ways to add value

Resources: Your network, books/articles and digital tools, etc

Ideas: Ideas that help them in some way.

Time: Offering time to work on or talk through something.
