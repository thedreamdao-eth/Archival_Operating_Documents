## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Charlotte

- **How DeSci is Creating Positive Disruption**
- Sandra went from studying primates to blockchain during the pandemic.  She found Molecule while searching for something in the DeSci space.
- Scientists spend almost 50% of their time writing research proposals for external grants.  However, lack of time and connections leads to the ‚Äúvalley of death‚Äù for research.
- 3-year and short-term grants also discourage long-term projects that could lead to scientific breakthroughs.
- DeSci = Decentralized Science
    - ‚ÄúA movement using blockchain technology to revolutionize scientific research and funding‚Äù
- Molecule is a decentralized biotech protocol building a new funding infrastructure - the IP-NFT.
    - The Longevity Molecule (IPNFT) was a success of the project.

Harry: Do you see community-owned science as a way to open up science and bridge the gap between scientists and consumers?

- This opens up communication.  I see this technology expanding into communities who have typically not had a say in what research gets funded and developed.

How will the IPNFT own//distribute/manage the research?

- For now, it will mainly be DAOs deciding through their governance structure what projects get funding.  Profits will go to everyone.

Mel: How can people start collaborating in DeSci?

- The first step would be to join a Discord and introduce yourself.  Putting yourself out there is really important.  I would also be very happy to help make connections; I especially want to see the development of DeSci in Latin America.
- Harry: There are different groups like LabDAO that can also help with these connections and the space.

Madhav: Are there any DAOs working on physics that you know of?

- I‚Äôm not sure I know of any at the moment.
- Harry: I don‚Äôt know of any DAOs, but this is an exciting time/space and you can also explore/develop more.

Jae-Hee: How do you think DAO frameworks and decentralization gel with traditionally hierarchical chain of commands in research labs? What kind of reactions have you seen from conventional scientists to Desci?

- I think science is becoming more open.  In terms of reactions, some are really skeptical of the new structure.  A lot of the time, they have to read and go through the material to truly understand how it will work.
- Harry: If scientists can get rid of traditional bottlenecks and focus on getting the research done, they will jump at the chance.

Jae-Hee: Besides the bureaucracy, what are the important parts of the convoluted application process that you think is worth keeping?

- Harry: Science still needs to be well thought-out and screened for viability.  We want to get rid of unnecessary roadblocks.

Madhav: Is there a reason that so many DeSci DAOs are focused on biology and medicine?

- I would say that it is because biology and medicine has gone through so much.  DAOs want to come out with new treatments and new ideas.
- Madhav: It‚Äôs easier and faster to capitalize on biology/medicine than physics/math.

Charlotte: What are the backgrounds of the people in Molecule?

- We have business people and entrepreneurs, start-up experts, people with legal backgrounds, anthropologists, and people in science.  We are an incredibly diverse community!

Aishah: Is it possible for people to get involved DeSci but don't have a strong background in science? What is the best way to learn and get involved?

- To your first question, absolutely.  The best way to get involved and learn is to just join our Discord.  We have a blog, YouTube videos, etc. that we can share.  We are a super inclusive community, so don‚Äôt be discouraged.  Come in and contribute!

Harry: I saw recently that all federally-funded research will have to be accessible to the public.  What do you think the steps are to transitioning to a DeSci world?

- Right now, a big thing to grow the DeSci ecosystem is the accelerator Molecule is working on.  Molecule wants to empower people to create their own DAOs and establish their own research.

Dream DAO members have done their own science research!

Cool DeSci article, highly recommended! -
