## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Charlotte

- What is a meme?  Most people think of square images with captions spread widely online.  However, there is a broader definition.  It’s a unit that carries cultural ideas, symbols, or practices from one mind to another.
- Marc Andreessen and Elon Musk understand the value of memes.
- Humans are social creatures.  We like to fit in and stand out.  We mimic each other’s behavior and create new behaviors.
    - Arman: We create new ideas by building on old ones.
- Examples of memes: woke, build the wall, ACAB, climate crisis, that girl, two-party duopoly, nuclear family, fake news, social media dance challenge, solarpunk, “boomer,” “democracy”
- What makes memes influential?  Groups are eager to propagate the meme, they’re easy to remember and communicate, and they are full of meaning.
    - Case study: “Ok, Boomer”
        - Jae-Hee: Put Gen-Z into a new light.
- Web3 memes: gm, hodl, buidl, DAO, rugged, ape in
    - Web3 itself is a meme
- Web3 x social impact memes: regen, ReFi, green pill, public goods, coordination, moloch
- More memes: regenerati, optimism is the new punk, white hate mimetics, greenflection point, degen to regen pipeline, regen regime
- Angelina: This concept of mixing familiar with new words also reminds me of very basic storytelling techniques. Authors are playing around with phrases and often "break them" in the sense of changing small parts of them that make them different and forces you to see the phrase differently... (just as a small addition)
- Memes are the lego pieces of digital cultural.
- Memes that enabled Civics Unplugged to exist: democracy in crisis, Gen-Z as the next great generation, “the system is broken,” the idea of schools being trapped in the past
- Memes that CU has helped create: the kids will lead, civic superhero, learners as builders, build real democracy, leading lovingly, build the future of democracy
- Memes relevant to the Dream DAO’s success: civic innovation, civic innovator
    - Moves past the negative connotations of other similar ideas
- **Culturally impactful organizations leverage memes and create new ones to support their mission.**
- Case studies of BLM, Chinese government, Squid Game, Meta, solarpunk, etc.
    - Jae-Hee: Memes work well if they have some sophistication.  The second layer of Squid Game is the deeper meaning, and it propagated quickly.
- Recap:

## Provocation/Question: What memes have been toxic or harmful to your mindsets?

- Madison: Scarcity meme
- Gary: Zero sum world
- Jae-Hee: The end justifies the means, beauty is pain, grindset grindset, pull yourself up by your bootstraps, couch potato, the grind, sigma male
- Angelina: Toxic productivity

## Provocation/Question: What are the dangers of memes?

- Thessy: A meme quickly captures the essence of an idea.  However, memes use stereotypes that we should get away from.  We need to be careful about what we are putting out there.
- Madhav: Memes do build on the stereotypes that we have.
    - Thessy: Trump did this in a very dangerous way.
- Thessy: It has dangerous of propagating quick concepts that neglect context.
- Angelina: I agree; it creates trigger words.  People follow narratives and stories.
    - Thessy: These narratives also mean different things in different cultures.  When people come from different groups, things don’t always work.
- Jae-Hee: The structure of how we learn is incredibly important and relevant to our understanding.  The way memes present themselves can be dangerous.

## Provocation/Question: What are memes?  Why are they powerful?

- Arman: Memes are approachable and understandable to the general public.  People are moved by them.
- Madhav: Memes teach; complicated concepts become more understandable.
- Jae-Hee: The concept is contingent on what type of medium is being dealt with.  Memes are some of the only formats that can make it to the surface.
- Jae-Hee: It’s compressed language.  Not only can memes draw association, but also they also have a living sense of pathos. It’s like a fungible token.

## Provocation/Question: What’s the power of creating new words with memes?  Why wouldn’t you just use an old word?

- Karl: The ideas we wish to convey can only be understood with new language.  Old words don’t communicate it clearly.
- Thessy: It’s taking old words to create a new meaning.  We have to explain new concepts with old ideas.
- Gary: Abstract ideas find their meanings in relation to other words.

## Provocation/Question: What is the responsibility of people propagating memes?

- Madison: No matter how well you do at capturing a concept with a meme, there is no way to guess what it will be received as.  It’s difficult to ask for responsibility under these circumstances.
- Karl: People make memes from one specific perspective.  The other side doesn’t get much time.
- Madhav: Elon Musk pushed Dogecoin, and people invested, even if it wasn’t the best choice.  Should he have done that?
- Gary: It’s everyone responsibility.
