## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Shreya

- The Solarpunk movement is really coming to the forefront (ex: Dream DAO and Ethcc Barcelona) and every movement needs a North Star or purpose to be successful
- Visualization exercise: Pause for a moment and take a deep breath, close your eyes, and visualize what the world of tomorrow should like (What do the cities and buildings look like? What are students learning about in schools? What do our financial systems look like? What does a Solarpunk world feel like?)
- LaminaPOP builds housing (Costs 30% less to construct) for disenfranchised folks in Guatemala
- Cohere: Community of changemakers that are building innovation labs (bridging IRL and Web3)
- Create a deep sense of admiration for ourselves, communities, and the world
- Cohere Pillars: live freely, work remotely, and thrive together
- Cohere is a member-owned network of conscious co-living communities that provide the flexibility of renting and the value of owning.
- Co-living spaces for remote workers seeking a higher quality of life, deeper connection, community and frictionless collaboration.
- The benefit of making a regenerative investment in housing is freeing up energy and money for other important things in your life
