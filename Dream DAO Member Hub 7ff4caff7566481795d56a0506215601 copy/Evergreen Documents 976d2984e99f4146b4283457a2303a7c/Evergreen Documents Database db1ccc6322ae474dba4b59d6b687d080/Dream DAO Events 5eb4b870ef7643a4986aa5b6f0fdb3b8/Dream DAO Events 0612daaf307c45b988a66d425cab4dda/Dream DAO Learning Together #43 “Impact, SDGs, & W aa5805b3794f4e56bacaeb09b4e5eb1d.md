## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Charlotte

- Or Katzman works in the impact sphere.  He focuses on impact measurement and management, working with startups to figure out what kind of impact they have on the world, how to manage that impact, and how to talk about that.
- Impact is ‚Äúa powerful or major influence or effect‚Äù and ‚Äúany economic activity that has an effect on society or the environment.‚Äù  When talking about impact, it matters who you are talking to.  The business/nonprofit sense of the word comes from the idea of impact investing.  Impact investment is the idea of investing into a company not only for financial returns but also for social or environmental impact.
    - Impact investment has to be intentional, profitable, and measurable.
- There is a spectrum between philanthropy and traditional investments.  In between these extremes are different ways of thinking about impact.  We can think about companies that avoid harm, benefit stakeholders, and contribute to solutions in the world.
- We‚Äôve created a number of standards to measure impact.  The UN invited different groups to create a to-do list for our planet; from there, they created 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
    - The SDGs have a decentralized application; it‚Äôs on us to figure out how we can work on them.  They are 1) holistic, 2) based in sustainability, 3) a shared language, and 4) applicable to all.
    - Behind each goal are targets and indicators to help develop them specifically.  Intentional metrics are then used to measure impact for each goal.
- Impact washing can be an issue; companies aren‚Äôt being truthful about their connections to the SDGs (for money and resources, etc.).
- Impact can also be practical for investors and companies - if you are taking care of the water, you aren‚Äôt likely to be sued for pollution, etc.  It can be a helpful marketing technique, as well.
- Web3 relates strongly to impact.  Projects are community driven and involve stakeholders (like the SDGs do).  Measuring impact can be impactful for web3 as it fosters transparency and accountability.
- **Web3 Case Studies:**
    - Impact Market creates crypto UBI (universal basic income) and offers DIDs (decentralized IDs).  SDGs 1, 2, and 10.
    - Knowan works on sexual and reproductive health.  SDGs 5 and 3.
    - Sparrow works with SDGs 8 and 11 on transportation.
    - Ixo works with SDGs 13, 14, and 15 to think about our ecological systems - emissions, biological populations, etc.

These goals are imperfect.  Decentralization can often mean there are ‚Äúno teeth‚Äù - we can‚Äôt force people to create impact.  There are also ideas that are missing.

## Provocation/Question: Do you think that digitizing everything/ideas in our world is an issue?

- We live in the constraints that we have.  This meeting is better than nothing, even though it would have been better to meet in person.  Data is not impact, but it helps us talk about it.  We can be vigilant to make sure that we are remembering that we are using representations of real things.

## Provocation/Question: How can we make measurement of impact more accessible?

- MRV - monitoring, reporting, verification - costs a lot of money.  There is a significant barrier to entry, and people don‚Äôt make money for doing this ‚Äúbetter‚Äù thing.  Our economy has externalities; things aren‚Äôt always immediately factored into the cost of something (environmental damage, health impacts, etc.).  It is profitable for companies to have as many externalities as possible, and that‚Äôs not something we can solve with better MRV.  CSR (corporate social responsibility) reports are voluntary, but social peer pressure among companies can push groups to do more for impact.

## Provocation/Question: What are your thoughts on the quote, ‚ÄúProgress for the sake of progress must be discouraged‚Äù?

- Progress for the sake of progress, in the context of this situation, looks like creating metrics that don‚Äôt make us want to improve our impact.  Generally, we have goals that help us aim our work, and we have tools that help us get there.  Progress for the sake of progress is measuring just to measure.

## Provocation/Question: What do you do/what do you look at to measure impact?

- I was recently approached by a company that makes cameras to sense safety hazards, the environment around it, etc.  I first assess what the company does.  I can translate that data into a carbon footprint and measure efficiency.  I then help them figure out their data within impact metrics.  We create a plan to connect their work to these metrics and help them figure out how to communicate this to the public/stakeholders.  Finally, we work to create a management system to improve for the future and compete with other groups.
- **(Watch the recording around 46 minutes for a clear explanation of this concept.)**

## Provocation/Question: What are your thoughts on impact certificates?  Do we need standardized metrics?  If so, how do we do that?

- When we say ‚Äúimpact certificates,‚Äù some people mean different things.  There‚Äôs an actual product - a smart contract.  I don‚Äôt know all of the intricacies of this.  Metrics are really interesting.  Depending on the industry, there are different sets of standards.  This can cause confusion.  You were asking why we can‚Äôt all use the same ideas.  However, it‚Äôs really hard for us all to agree on a standard.  Why?  Because there‚Äôs money involved, and there are people who stand to lose or gain.  I think we should have standards, and I think we are getting closer to standards these days with merging ideas, etc.  Web3 has a number of organizations trying to work on this.  For example, ESG DAO is aiming to standardize ESG scores.  Unfortunately, some companies don‚Äôt want this; they don‚Äôt want an accurate score, they want the highest possible score.
