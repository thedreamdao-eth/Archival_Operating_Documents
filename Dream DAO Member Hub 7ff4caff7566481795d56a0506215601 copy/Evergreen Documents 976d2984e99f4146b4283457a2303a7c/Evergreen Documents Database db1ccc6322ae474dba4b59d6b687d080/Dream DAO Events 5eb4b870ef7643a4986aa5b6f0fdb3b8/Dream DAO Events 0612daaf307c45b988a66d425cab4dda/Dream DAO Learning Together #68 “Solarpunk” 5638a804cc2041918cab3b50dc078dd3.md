Notes by <Fernando>

### Oliver Yehlik - Host of Learning Together Session

Oliver is currently a Dream DAO builder from Season 1 interested in Solarpunk, he held amazing Solarpunk Study Group sessions as part of the Dream DAO in Season 1 and part of Season 2. Currently, Oliver is studying college at Minnesota, he is interested in studying Solarpunk having an interest in mixing technology with impact change in the world. Also, he is researching the ways in which climate-focused organizations reframe perceptions of the climate crisis to improve community understanding all over the world.

During his investigation of the ways in which organizations are reframing perceptions of the climate crisis. Oliver has raised the following questions:

1. ***‚ÄúWhat are the stories we tell ourselves?‚Äù:*** He mentions that this question asks us to consider how we frame the problem and what self-limiting beliefs influence our capacity to bring about change.
2. ***What are different stories we can tell?‚Äù:*** He mentions that by studying transformative narratives, we might learn to become more effective ‚Äústorytellers‚Äù and communicators.

Oliver told that his research into these questions will entail interviews with climate-focused organizations, community organizers, and climate activists. He also shared with us that he will also use autoethnographic methods to reflect on connections with his own experience and relevant literature.

### What is Solarpunk?

First of all, one important thing in this session is to answer What is Solarpunk? or What do we know about Solarpunk?

One of the answers in the session about what people think is Solarpunk says that Solarpunk is a new movement that envisions and works towards actualizing a sustainable future interconnected with nature. Continuing with this answer, Oliver considers that we can make progress in changing our way of thinking, he believes that Solarpunk helps us transform everything and he believes it is the change we need for a sustainable future.

Part of the ideas that Oliver shares about Solarpunk are:

<aside>
üíö Solarpunk embodies a deeper substrate of how humans identify themselves within the landscape of man-made & organic contexts.

</aside>

<aside>
üåä In the case of Solarpunk, the narrative we‚Äôre telling ourselves can give us profound hope and agency in building the future we want to see, exploring the role technology might play in it, and in coordinating collectively rather than as mere individuals.

</aside>

<aside>
üîÆ Solarpunk is a home for planetary health and harmony, but also the human abilities of resistance and resilience. It gives us the energy to stay in the fight while cultivating our joy and generosity for building something better.

### Solarpunk Learning Stuff
