(Youtube channel recommended: EmprendeEmprendiendo) 

> *Art is a business too*
> 
1. Defining your target public: What kind of people you want to reach
2. The best way to segment an audience is by being yourself.

> *I use art as a way to fight against my demons, I hope you feel the same when you get one piece.*
> 

> *Luck is nothing more than a mix between perseverance and confidence*
> 

> *Don’t force people to buy your stuff, make them want your staff*
> 

Is not about making them love your art, but to love the artist

**Can this be used for irl things?**

Yeah it can be used for things that impact positively in the society, for instance, helping kids to enjoy a good moment receiving gifts on christmas. 

**How to use it?**

Connect digital art with objects in real life.

**What else can I do?**

Holders receive a physical copy and their names are going to be on the book.

💡 Money isn’t everything, reflect about how you can use NFTs or other web3 resources to benefit others.

Don’t let hard times to beat yourself, instead take it as a reason to be the very best version of yourself.
