## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Charlotte

(I recommend everyone interested in this lecture watch the recording - these notes likely missed main ideas due to my own lack of context!)

- Branson Lee started in tech as an intern at a programming/database company.  He worked for a number of companies, including LinkedIn.  In 2016, he founded a start-up involving blockchains for companies.  He is now the crypto lead at an American firm.  He is the director of the Alice Foundation and is an adjunct professor teaching blockchain and tokenization.
- Christi: Are you excited for the ETH merge?
    - I’m very excited.  It was interesting - these are the things that will eventually affect all of us.  The merge is the “next major incident” in the blockchain space (in about thirteen days).
- Every technology starts with a lot of hype.  Expectations will be very high.  There is a period of disillusionment, but it goes back up slowly.  An example of this is with NFTs, etc.

- There is a split (currently) between people interested in web3 and tokenization.
- ICO projects declined rapidly in a few years.  Things change very quickly in this space.
- ICOs and STOs are different.  Also, IEOs and IDOs.

- There are multiple phases for ICOs.  The initial backers make a lot of money.
- I advise people to do treasury management when they get involved with finances and blockchain.  You must prepare for periods where you lose money; you have to manage risk.  Even if your funds are good, your project can’t continue if that changes.
- STOs are Security Token Offerings.  They use tokens to go public.  It’s extremely regulated, and you have to work with traditional players - lawyers, etc.
- The SEC went after ICOs pretty heavily a few years ago.
- Almond: Would you say that the next slot for ICOs could be DAOs?
    - I see ICOs as a fundraising mechanism; DAOs are separate.
- Everything we do in web3 eventually needs to be anchored to traditional investments.  Ideas need to converage.

- Almond: Can you elaborate on carbon tokenization?
    - Countries signed the Paris Accords.  Nations have to reduce carbon emissions, but certain countries cannot do that - their economies rely on manufacturing, etc.  If they still emit carbon, but they signed on to the Accords, they buy carbon credits to “make” their impact.  There is a huge market for this.
