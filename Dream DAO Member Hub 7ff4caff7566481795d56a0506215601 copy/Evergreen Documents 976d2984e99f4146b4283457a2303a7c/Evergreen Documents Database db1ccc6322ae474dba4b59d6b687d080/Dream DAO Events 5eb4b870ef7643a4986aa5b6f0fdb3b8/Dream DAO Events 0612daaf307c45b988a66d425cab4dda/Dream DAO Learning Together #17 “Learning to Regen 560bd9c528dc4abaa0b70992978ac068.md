## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes taken by Angelina 

- We can be a **keystone species**, just like a starfish
    - where starfish were removed the ecosystem degenerated
- Gen Z is actually Gen K (keystone) or Gen:RE (regenerative)
- this generation will be what you make out of it
    - what does Gen:Re mean to you personally?
    - see: [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOEfptGQ=/](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOEfptGQ=/)
- There is something really powerful in this collision between young ideas and already existing work
- we went away from nature and expected religion to replace this
    - the way church dealt with it: demonizing women who were in touch with nature (instead of turning to nature)
- We shouldn’t see ourselves separate from nature but rather as a part of it
- 4 **Levels of Paradigms**
    - we have different mindsets, we look at the word in different paradigms
    - how you view yourself will affect the way you act in the world
- instead of reducing negative impact, we should rather actively invest in creating positive impact
- **Regenerative life** (even one step further): we have a role within an ecosystem rather than dominating the system
    
    > Recognize place in developing the system’s essence and potential, cultivate its adaptive capacity to make life better for every being. Wider wealth creation.
    > 
- Nested Capital: when we work regeneratively we have no choice but to recognize the interconnectedness of things
- how do we turn “financial” into more than just value chasing?
    - the function of finance-related things should be to support all these other wealth mechanisms
- regenerative means teaching young people how to do something so that they can go and apply it themselves
- Inter-group mediation - how to we involved more generations
    - how to bring in cultures/diversity and start celebrating differences
- the most important thing about regeneration: awareness of being in service to the greater whole
- 3 loops: nurturing start up & helping them become mainstream, breaking down mainstream/institutions
- institutional credibility (mainstream)
    - (Madison: to institutional credibility- we still live in the "old world" while building the new one. people respect if you go to an ivy league, work at a top tech company, or receive support from a huge brand. when regens are paving a new path- they need credibility that people are familiar with so they aren't seen as crazy)
- Gens:Pre we are the insititutions
    - so what do you´(Gen:Re) expect from the institutions?
    - “where wisdom can flow like a public good” (sticky note)
- we don’t want to learn everything from scratch, but at the same time you don’t want to end up at the same place → sort of dilemma
    - how do you assess what the actual mistakes are? this is super important in order to prevent repeating the same mistakes
    - current/past **mistakes**: thinking of the world from just a “arresting decline” or just a “doing good” perspective
        - my idea of doing good might be totally different from yours, people are acting from what their perception of good is, that’s why we are colliding
    - one of our main mistakes is/has been: not recognizing those different places which we act from
    - there is no “higher place” from which we are acting. don’t think: I’m in dominion of nature, think: I’m playing a part in this whole
- Mental shift (regerating life mindset): thinking of your role within the larger system
    - e.g. prior gens becoming mentors for Gen:re
- when we were setting up grant: we wanted to support “unruly” projects
    - what does support look like then?
    - default setting for subsidies are often at the level: arrest decline or do good
    - “remain open-minded to learn and egage with new tech/pop culture ...” (sticky note)
        - yes, always remain open-minded, we can all learn from one another
- Paradigm shifting
- what’s interesting about greenpill is that it’s very finance focused, which is good, but now we should zoom out and see where else we can implement those ideas
- if we define something (like paths), this also means exclusion
- we have to find a way of making nature more accessible and vibrant

## Provocation/Question: what are your top 3 book recs?

- Regenerative Leadership:
    - there is no absolute truth, it’s gonna get you to a place that speaks to you
    - it’s a shift of mindset
- Dune (got Gustavo into environmentalism)
- A parable of the sower (by Octavaia Butler)

## Provocation/Question: the higher you move from level to level - how do you get companies move to the next level?

- so far, my projects haven’t gotten to the regenerative sphere (lack of money)
- there are examples: when businesses adopt these principles, they have better returns (only long-terms though)
- factory as a force
    - gecko glue
- tiny steel mill
    - only working within local communities
    - self-organized
    - when ppl are self-organized (inner self connecting to outer self), they are working better
    - when decisions are made centrally, ppl tend to care less about them
        - e.g. a government ppl don’t care about instead of their local community
    - web3: money doesn’t have to come from institutions anymore
    - we started from an asset-mentality (giving asset to someone and thus creating a relationship)
    - now flipping it: giving money to where ppl are already working
- better regenerative over long-term
- create new asset classes

## Provocation/Question: are there new types of institutionalized credibility in a regen world? How could that look like?

- it will look different
- if you’ve worked for a regen company, that follows you (reputation)
    - being recognized for that without needing references
- right now you are incentivized to do what gets you the next job
- web3 allows us to do what matters to us
    - holding institutions accountable to what’s meaninful
    - credibility doesn’t arise from one single thing/institution (anymore) but rather from many different interactions

## Provocation/Question: How to achieve equilibrium in abundance?

- we don’t build projects that have to be around forever
- when we’ve succeeded we’re no longer needed (”we will have succeeded when we are no longer needed”)
- business that has a clear vision and purpose, when reached they don’t need to be there any longer
- how we balance that - we build in the point when we know we’ve reached max. potential
- it’s by having support by younger trees throughout the journey
- really sticking with the purpose!

## Provocation/Question: How do we make sure that even as we dive super deep into web3 we don't become out of touch?

- 

## Provocation/Question: How does all of this remain understandable to people (folx?) who don't go deep?

-
