## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Charlotte

- Helena Merk is our host.  She has worked in programming and software but is now also focusing on climate.
- ReFi has positive externalities, satisfies human needs, and establishes new equilibrium between the two concepts.
- Programmable money creates economic systems designed around programmers‚Äô values.
- Tokenized carbon credits can be pooled to create liquidity and utility as well as de-risk.  Tokenized Forward Agreements can be used for the future.
- Carbon Markets TLDR: completed climate project + organization emissions = ‚Äúcarbon neutrality‚Äù
    - A climate project completed becomes a ‚Äúcarbon credit‚Äù that is issued and purchased by an organization.
    - Unfortunately, not all credits are created equally and not all are of the same quality.
    - There are additional layers of complexity - feasibility assessments and verifications for the credits, data collection for the companies, etc.  These complexities cause a number of issues and problems.
- For ‚ÄúClimate Crypto‚Äù to work, projects have to benefit the planet but also have financial gains.
    - Toucan and Flowcarbon are working on this.  Solid World is also tokenizing contracts.
- ‚ÄúNature Backed Currency‚Äù is used to describe us backing our currency with natural biodiversity, impact, and values.
- Regenerative infrastructure is being built in spaces like Celo, Spirals, and Return.
- Spirals is working on making it easier for nodes to share profits for social impact.  This will push others to also focus on social impact.  Spirals is also working on decentralized (climate) verifications that don‚Äôt make it a financial burden to be approved.

## Provocation/Question: Why did you join this session?

- Havish: The fact that I know very little about climate change, crypto, and etc. is what made me so curious to learn.

## Provocation/Question: Why was climate your choice of career?

- It seems like the biggest problem we are facing.  There are endless reasons why I work on it.  I didn‚Äôt feel qualified in the beginning, but really, I was just scared.  Whatever background you are coming from, there is a space for you.  Not having experience shouldn‚Äôt stop you.
- I‚Äôve always been involved with animals and nature.  My frustration came when my work wouldn‚Äôt scale.  Solving the system is necessary to prevent injuries.

## Provocation/Question: How did you deal with the people when you were building "Spirals", because personally I know that when you start building something about the environment usually people try to discourage, could you give us some advice?

- Surround yourself with better people.  For investors, climate might not be super attractive.  In these circles, the environment won‚Äôt have great returns.  Either stay out of these circles or make it profitable for them.  You can also look into different sectors.
