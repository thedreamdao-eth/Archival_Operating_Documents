## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by Charlotte

- Josie Wang works with Fennie Wang.
- Environmental economics is the idea that as we‚Äôve been developing our businesses, we‚Äôve seen human interactions and economics as separate from nature.  This is an accounting issue - we have an impact on the environment at all times.  We have to be able to measure how much damage we are creating and how much it would cost to reverse this damage.
- We haven‚Äôt been asking people to pay for the cost of environmental damage when they pay for their goods.  This has a societal impact.
- Regen Network (Josie‚Äôs company) is attempting to pay and support farms that are helping the environment.  Regen Network is trying to take finances from the carbon network to pay farmers with cryptocurrency.  Fennie‚Äôs law experience and experiences with local currencies have been invaluable with this.
- DAO Interests **(view provocation below)**
    - Sustainable Agriculture
    - Collective Ownership/Coordination
    - Kate Raworth (Economist) & Schmachtenberger (Systems Thinker)
- Our world is centralized.  Our banks are closely connected to the government‚Äôs creation of the national currency.  The idea behind a local currency is to bring way more dollars to local communities and community banks.  If you give these banks value, they are likely to invest back into the community and the people around you.  However, larger financial institutions will spread that money around.
- We‚Äôve realized that we can create stored community values and tokens in a way where people are inherently incentivized to hold them.  This avoids credit card companies - which are quite costly - and other costs.  Local businesses have improved profit margins and local consumers get really good deals.
    - This was originally awkward because it encouraged physical tokens in a ‚Äúcashless‚Äù world.  The blockchain can eliminate this main barrier.
- Jae-Hee: I‚Äôm interested in seeing what variables influence the implementation of this in local communities and what demographics are more prone to use.
    - Josie Watson: That‚Äôs a question I also have.  These incentives are rather subtle at first, but they can build to amount to a lot.  This is a hard gap to bridge.  If we do bridge it, though, it cannot be regulated at the federal level.
- At 48 minutes - Fennie gives a deep dive! [youtube.com/watch?v=rmNdm3sYIMc](http://youtube.com/watch?v=rmNdm3sYIMc)
- Jae-Hee: I would say that the struggle that Seeds may have is that a consistent focus on values could distract from getting roots down and building.  Once we can speak the language of these values, it‚Äôs wonderful - but it‚Äôs very hard for outsiders and the environment isn‚Äôt permeable.  I feel like it could be dangerous to assume that this language could become mainstream.  What are your thoughts around this?
    - Josie Watson: That‚Äôs an excellent articulation.  A lot of the people attracted to using this technology like the idea that it‚Äôs time for us to redistribute power.  When I think about this idea of communicating with the public, if the people building these tools can get really specific about how we are solving this problem - while removing the technological jargon - we can talk to everyone.  If you think a system is broken, create a better system in parallel and try to create a bridge and flow between the systems.
    - We can explore this space of collective action, with technology, in multiple ways.  From the systems perspective, identifying leverage points and focusing on building things better can bring more people in.
    - Carl: I think a lot of people recognize that we aren‚Äôt coordinating well on a global level.  However, we‚Äôve also lost the ability to do that on a local level over the last fifty-or-so years.  We hope that there are lessons we can take to solve both of these problems.
- Jae-Hee: I‚Äôve heard of people critical of micro-finance, but I‚Äôve also heard the opposite perspective.  Thoughts?
    - Josie Watson: Acumen is 100% awesome - the philanthropic system is huge issue to look at and apply web3 tech to.

Questions for Fennie:

1. Most successful pathways for community engagement and adoption she‚Äôs observed so far?
2. Communication for building political momentum‚Ä¶ appealing to the masses??

## Provocation/Question: How/why have you approached the blockchain, and with what background?

- Carl: In my sector, sustainable agriculture, price negotiations have caused so many problems.  I‚Äôm really inspired by Regen Network‚Äôs work.
- Jae-Hee: I don‚Äôt have a background as rich as Carl‚Äôs, but, over high school, I dabbled in economists that were proposing different ways of exchanging capital.  Kate Raworth, Schmachtenberger, etc.
    - Josie Watson: We are in the explosion of web3 projects.  We‚Äôve gotten to the point where individuals who aren‚Äôt trained in coding have access to user-friendly places to build companies.  We have yet to see the social-aligned model take off with this, however.  Seeds has encoded incredible social change theory into their work with local currencies.  One thing that Seeds has done is sponsor graduate students to create a course on transforming our world into a regenerative one.
