Hi Community Building Working Group Members!

Though we had just six people join in today’s call (I need to put up the back end stuff on time, will do that the coming week onwards!), we realise a need to prioritise which among the given To-Dos mentioned here need to be dealt on an urgent note, while which need more dialogue upon.

Below is a unstructured list of Priorities our working group needs to address-

- 1️⃣Dream DAO Types of Events and Spaces for Season 2
    
    Understanding which role gets access to what spaces
    
- 2️⃣The Dream DAO Constitution
    
    Referring the Builder, Champion principles, the Solarpunk Vision Document, Conflict Resolution and Plug-in system directives, so as to compile a DAO Constitution.
    
- 3️⃣Conflict Resolution System
- 4️⃣Discussing the Concept of ‘Pluralistic Contribution’
- 5️⃣Review and test the micro plug in kit as a way to reactivate members
- 6️⃣Create a process for doing once-a-season retros
- 7️⃣Get more people signing up for [Intros.ai](http://intros.ai/)
- 8️⃣Create an official welcome/onboarding process for potential supporters/contributors
- 9️⃣Mandate Dream DAO breaks at least once a season

As we realise there are so many interesting and thought provoking things to do, let’s take an opportunity to share on what we should prioritise and what we can stretch for further discussions. I shall be creating threads for the following items (while we prioritise the rest) and then we can join the thread of our choice!-

1. 1️⃣Dream DAO Roles and access to types of Events and Spaces for Season 2
    
    > Here is the Document concerning the discussion we had during the call! Feel free to add in or comment edits/deletions
    
2. 2️⃣The Dream DAO Constitution (I feel this is something we can have a collab with Documentation and Governance WG? and then subsequently reach out to the rest of the community?)
3. 3️⃣Discussing and Implementing the Concept of “Pluralistic Contribution”
    
    (From my interpretation of the same, it means that we have a system that ensures none of us overwork or take up too much of responsibilities and leave little space to facilitate, and that none of us feel excluded at the same time, with respect to our bandwidths for a given period of time)
    

Thank you so much for reading through this, from this time onwards it is my pinkie promise that I’ll be sending out the links for the call and updates on Email as well as Discord <3

Yours very sincerely,

Karl-Arman Singh
