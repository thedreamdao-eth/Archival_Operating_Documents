## Lecture (20 mins)

Notes by <>

- About the Host (Marco, also Bear)
    - Decided to open a company with the idea to do something for the planet to spread awareness instead of attending university. Working on Bitcoin project and works as a web3 explorer. Fun fact: likes to climb and hike in their free time!
- Plan
    - 15 min - climate change countdown and the power of creativity and art
    - 5 min - Break
    - 30 min - creativity workshop on Figma
- Part 1
    - Climate change requires a quick and efficient solution while taking into account that climate change encompasses many different challenges. Thus, Climate Change Countdown was born. First step is to document climate change through art to express emotion and use as a tool to stop a moment in time. Second step is to spread awareness and make people understand the different factors that impact the climate. Third step is to inspire more people to take action.
    - How did C3 start? With an idea. Marco saw the effectiveness of daily art and combined this with his interest to use art to address events and themes. He saw a lack of climate art used to create discussion and sought out to address it. Realize how important creativity is in life.
    - So far, he‚Äôs made 220 daily art posts including documenting power production, glaciers collapse, and ecovillages across the world. Ex. floods in Germany. Today makes 221st. Idea is to use these art posts to inspire change; at least one post a day. In the future, the goal is to transform these art pieces into a collective (maybe in 2 years) where a group of artists can publish art each day.
    - Conclusion: we need multiple solutions to address climate change. This means being creative to find these solution. Of course, art can not solve the climate emergency but it can solve one part of it.

## Provocation/Question: Can plastic pollution be clean up?

- Carl: Yes, by showing recent examples of lost biodiversity and ecosystem destruction (ex. dead zone and fat barges)
- Madison: Yes, by reducing how much plastic we use and creating bounties to clean up beach plastic
    - Marco: Are we talking about web3 bounties?
        - Madison: Mentioned from an already existing opportunity for locals to clean their own beaches. One other benefit is that they get to be onboarded to web3.  ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S9uxDRJAdo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S9uxDRJAdo))
- Reid: Incentives and inspiring local communities and companies to actively switch to a more environmentally friendly lifestyle or method
- Jon: Minimize addition of plastic waste and push funding towards clean-up solutions
    - Marco: How would you minimize consumption?
        - Jon: 2 main means include consumption/distribution regulation and by incentivizing people in ‚Äúthe back-end‚Äù for businesses
- Ibtehaj: Start small by teaching students in schools how to lead a sustainable lifestyle
- Marco: Use drones to map plastic presence which communities can use to locate and clean those areas; use a portable plastic bag

## Provocation/Question: How to combat people‚Äôs doubts in climate change?

- Carl: Meet those people where they are at and look for small improvement or ideas that can help them understand the reality of what the state of our climate looks like. Also, memes can create humour-led climate action.
    - Marco: How would you meet them where they are at?
        - Carl: Depends on where they are starting from. Some people may not have started thinking about it much so it would start with exposing them to art and other mediums. Others have done research and you providing more stats to persuade them.
- Jaynie: Show the difference between the past and now, highlighting climate impact through art mediums
- Jon: Create and show art and educative films to the public to combat misinformation
- Ibtehaj: Make art more accessible and collaborative to spark open discussions on climate change
    - Marco: Almost the opposite of what Jon was saying. Both are important in their own ways.
- Madison: Show tangible consequences happening now (ex. extreme weather)
    - Bear: How would you show this?
        - Madison: It‚Äôs hard to connect individual weather events to climate change so instead show the changing weather patterns different from the past and future.
- Reid: Bring up climate initiative that show improvement in the climate is possible after explaining current climate consequence
    - Marco: Is the first part similiar to what Madison was proposing in terms of cleaning?
        - Reid: That is one way but for local businesses, some are using a lot of plastic which they can reduce by switching to reusable items.

## Question: How do you decide what to photograph each day?

- Marco: Having to produce a piece of art every day, it helps that there are multiple options to select from to photograph. The image used each day depends on a variety of factors.
