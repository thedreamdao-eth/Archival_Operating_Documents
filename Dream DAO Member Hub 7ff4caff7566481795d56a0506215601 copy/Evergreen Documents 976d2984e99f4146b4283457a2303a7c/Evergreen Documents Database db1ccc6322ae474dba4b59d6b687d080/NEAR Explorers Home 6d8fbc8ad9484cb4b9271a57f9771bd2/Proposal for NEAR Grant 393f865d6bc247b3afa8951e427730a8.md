# Proposal for NEAR Grant

üéØ**Goals:**

1. Develop a NEAR Protocol-based resource hub for beginners in web3, accessible to non-technical users.
2. Organize IRL educational web3 events for students.
3. Provide bounties for Dream DAO builders creating learning artefacts from the resource hub. We plan to open it for all after some time.

üí°**Description:**
Our group of four NEAR explorers (Adarsh, Aditya, Amanda, and Madhav) aims to access the remaining 2000 USD grant from Dream DAO to create a resource hub for web3 beginners based on the NEAR Protocol. We are also working to conduct workshops, talks, and discussions to promote web3 and NEAR adoption, and we plan to target high school and college students through this. The funds will also be used to organise educational events and provide content creation bounties.

With this proposal, we are requesting access to the remaining 2000 USD from the NEAR grant, which was originally for five members but was left unused due to our group consisting of only four members. This additional funding will allow us to develop the NEAR Protocol-based resource hub effectively, organize educational events, and provide bounties for Dream DAO S3 members creating learning artefacts.

The fund allocation is as follows:

1. Resource hub development: A portion of the 2000 USD will be used to build and maintain the web3 resource hub on the NEAR Protocol, making it accessible for beginners and non-technical users.
2. Educational events: Part of the funding will be dedicated to organizing IRL educational web3 events for college students in India and Brazil, such as workshops, talks, and discussions.
3. Bounties and rewards: The remaining funds will be distributed as bounties to Dream DAO builders who create various learning artefacts from the resource hub, including deep dives, blogs, reels, and research content.

By accessing the remaining 2000 USD, we can ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of our efforts in promoting web3 and NEAR adoption and fostering engagement through educational content and incentives.

üíö**Benefits:**

- Exposure of Dream DAO X NEAR partnership, bringing a potential grant renewal from NEAR Foundation.
- Introduce web3 and NEAR to a new audience, fostering adoption.
- Empower local communities with knowledge and resources.
- Encourage engagement through bounties and rewards in the Dream DAO.

üìà**Success Metrics:**

- Quality and quantity of learning artefacts created.
- Positive feedback from participants.
- At least 2 IRL events organized
- Increased adoption of web3 and NEAR in target areas.
