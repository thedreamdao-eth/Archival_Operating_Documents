This week we were joined by our friends Tamil and Saravanan. We started by introducing ourselves and then Tamil and Saravanan introduced themselves. Tamil is a software and hardware guy who began his coding journey at the age of 13 years. Further, he told us how Saravanan is his Dream DAO. We didn’t get to hear much from Saravanan(bcz of his mic issue), although he introduced himself as a tech enthusiast.

### Topics

Web3 vs Web2

Edge Analytics

Future of Edge Analytics in Web3

Blockchain on Metaverse

The discussion started with Tamil sharing about ***web3 vs web2*** on the topics around databases.
He talked about the differences between SQL and NoSQL. Further, he introduced us to two different database services:

1. RDS - Relational Database Service
2. REDSHIFT - Clustered Database Service

Then we moved ahead and talked about Edge Analytics and its future in web3.

Continuing ahead he shared his project with us, and the demo of this he shared during the WebConf, Goa as well. 

**Gesture Control Pointing Device Ring:** It is a wearable device that can control Bluetooth-enabled smart devices.

His idea is to develop this Ring as a cryptocurrency wallet or a Ring which stores all the web3 assets in one place. 

After this, he briefed us about his other project(a virtual skateboard).

To gain knowledge around web3 and especially about “The Merge”, Tamil asked us to share.
Aditya took the stage and shared how things changed after ETH Merge and their future plans on sharding.
