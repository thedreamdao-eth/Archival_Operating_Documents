# NEAR DAO Tooling

## NEAR & DAOs

I will be showcasing my experience with Astro DAO and Sputnik DAO mostly. We created a DAO on both of these platforms to understand the DAO tooling on NEAR.
**The other tools are being reviewed.*

To understand DAO tooling on NEAR we need to understand Astro DAO and Sputnik DAO, both are NEAR-based launchpads for DAOs. Astro DAO is home to hundreds of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations on NEAR Protocol. 

If you want to launch your DAO without writing smart contracts, Astro DAO is your go-to app. It is very simple and easy to understand, you can do multiple things on one app.

It needs a minimum of 6 NEAR tokens as assets to setup up a DAO. It will be deposited in your DAOâ€™s treasury.

Sputnik DAO

Sputnik DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that is built on the NEAR protocol. Where members can propose and vote on projects.

Sputnik DAO is transparent, as all proposals and votes are recorded on the NEAR blockchain, and it is decentralized, as it is governed by its members rather than a central authority. It is also autonomous, as it operates without the need for intermediaries or central control.

Overall, Sputnik DAO is a decentralized organization that is designed to support and grow the NEAR ecosystem through decentralized decision-making and community collaboration.

**Governance & Voting**

We can do most of the governance and voting things on Astro Dao, but it is quite complicated due to its structure. 

Sputnik DAO also provides voting on Proposals with a space for discussion.

**Treasury Management** 

Again ASTRO DAO can be used for keeping track of the treasury.

**Contribution & Compensation** 

Compensation to the contributors can be done using the inbuilt bounty system, but as it needs to go through the proposal it will take time. To take on bounty you need to pay some NEAR token as well (It is set at 0.1 NEAR, you can change it)

Some of the tools and resources available for building and interacting with DAOs on the NEAR protocol include:

- NEAR Studio: A web-based integrated development environment (IDE) for building and deploying smart contracts and DApps on the NEAR protocol. It includes a code editor, debugger, and testing tools.
- NEAR Explorer: A block explorer for the NEAR protocol that allows users to view and search for transactions, blocks, and other data on the NEAR blockchain.
- NEAR Wallet: A web-based wallet for storing, managing, and interacting with NEAR and other digital assets on the NEAR protocol.

In addition to these tools, the NEAR community has also developed a number of libraries and frameworks that can be used to build DAOs on the NEAR protocol, including the NEAR.js library and the ReactNEAR framework.

Overall, the NEAR protocol provides a wide range of tools and resources for developers to build and deploy DAOs, making it a powerful platform for decentralized application development.
