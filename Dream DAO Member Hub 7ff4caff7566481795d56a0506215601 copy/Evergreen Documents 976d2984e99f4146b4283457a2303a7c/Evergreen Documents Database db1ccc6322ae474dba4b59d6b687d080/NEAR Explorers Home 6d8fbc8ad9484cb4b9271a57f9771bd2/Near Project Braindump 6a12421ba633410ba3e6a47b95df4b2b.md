### DAOs

---

We can create a DAO that helps people get together to work towards real life projects, 

solving issues from many countries (e.g a DAO that its members brings financial education

to young people; it will fund and give resources to the members so they can take action)

Ideas of DAOs â†’ educational, funding, artistic, climate action, diversity support

### NFT Projects

---

We can create a NFT project that its funding will go to a bigger cause, maybe existential projects, or

we create a project that will be connected to it.

â†’ thereâ€™s also no problem in doing both (a DAO that is partially funded by its own NFT project)
