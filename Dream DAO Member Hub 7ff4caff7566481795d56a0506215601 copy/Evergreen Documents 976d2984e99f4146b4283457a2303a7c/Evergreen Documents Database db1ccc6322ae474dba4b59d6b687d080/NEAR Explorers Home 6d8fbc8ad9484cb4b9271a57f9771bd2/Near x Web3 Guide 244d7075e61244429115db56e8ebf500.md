# Near x Web3 Guide

<aside>
💡 the idea of this document is to present web3 from Near POV. It would be used by incoming builders, especially for those who don’t know what web3 is, or Near protocol.

### What’s blockchain?

Blockchain is literally a chain of blocks. The information on each chain is stored in blocks, once a block suffers a change, the entire chain loses its validation unless the same change is made from that block forward.

When sharing data, our computer does various transactions, ‘’numbering’’ each so the message can be received in the correct order. Imagine you are communicating with someone by letters, but instead of sending all in one batch, you write 5 and number each so the other person can read in the correct order. That’s how *data in motion* works.

The blockchain is a history of all these transactions, and each time updated information comes in, a new block is set up with records of a transaction made.

- Each member of a Blockchain has access to a transaction history, like a book, and they are able to see the registration of these transactions, which are immutable.
- No one is able to change a transaction after its completion (because it enters the history book). If a change is needed, you need to do a new transaction and both will be visible in the blockchain.
- All is controlled by Smart Contracts — an automated contract programmed to perform an action when meeting a pre-determined set of conditions that were translated into coding language ***(but we will check this later!)***.

### What’s web3?

Let’s think of Web 1.0 first → the primarily version of the Web were basically a small amount of people sharing information online that allowed most of us to read it, but that was it. Web1 was passive, you would have access, to facts, content, and information like a digital encyclopedia. 

Whilst web1 was about a few sharing content for a bigger amount of people, web2 consisted on allowing users to participate in sharing information, emphasizes on **UGC (User-Generated Content) — communities, social media, messaging, and collaborations.** In web2, the users can interact by creating and sharing content: podcasting, Instagram and Twitter, blogging etc.

Taking the words of **[John Terra](https://www.simplilearn.com/what-is-web-1-0-web-2-0-and-web-3-0-with-their-difference-article#what_is_web_10)**: *‘**’Web 1.0 is the "read-only Web," Web 2.0 is the "participative social Web," and Web 3.0 is the "read, write, execute Web.”’’***

- But how can web3 be the ‘’read, write, execute web’’?

The main part of web3 is that no one owns your data and you can remain anonymous whenever you want. 

If you have ever been in a web3 organization website you probably saw the ***‘’connect wallet’’**,* instead of asking you to connect your email. Wallets have a random generated address made of numbers and letters that don’t give any human information; unless you buy a domain and choose to add your name like *amandamaritan.eth* no one will know who you are, even if is just *amanda.eth.*

### What’s Near Protocol?

intro dream dao x near protocol

→ use their docs info + near university and blog content

→ ecosystem

### How to explore Near?

→ we could add here near courses, resources etc, + a review of them; if we have done some of the courses we can add our POV + learnings as well

- I think we could also add some basic programming + tech guides here, @Madhav + anyone feel free to work on it and even write the guides if you want
