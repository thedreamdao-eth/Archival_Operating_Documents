In this week's NEAR WG jam, we were joined by [Allen Joseph](https://twitter.com/allenjosephaj), Head of NEAR, Aurora & StarkNet - Developer Relations at Chainstack.

Allen started by introducing himself and then walked us through the NEAR ecosystem and talked about his experience as DevRel. Further, he shared with us how we should continue exploring NEAR with help of multiple resources. Allen shared some resources and useful links with us:

### These are some of the highlights of the jam:

Near is a really good and hot place right now investing a lot in the new projects and helping folks who are looking to work with new startups. Allen suggested if you are interested in getting an internship or stuff make sure to be active in the community and reach out to folks like Shreyas.

*Idea:* maybe work with a project building on NEAR

*What if someone wants to start on NEAR?*

Just be active in the community people will help you out. 

Allen suggested we should try involving more with the NEAR community on Twitter and discord.

> Before the meeting, Madhav suggested looking for this [https://docs.near.org/develop/contracts/introduction](https://docs.near.org/develop/contracts/introduction) it is a good place to get a jit of how literally all the projects start.
Adarsh suggested this [https://learnnear.club/](https://learnnear.club/)
