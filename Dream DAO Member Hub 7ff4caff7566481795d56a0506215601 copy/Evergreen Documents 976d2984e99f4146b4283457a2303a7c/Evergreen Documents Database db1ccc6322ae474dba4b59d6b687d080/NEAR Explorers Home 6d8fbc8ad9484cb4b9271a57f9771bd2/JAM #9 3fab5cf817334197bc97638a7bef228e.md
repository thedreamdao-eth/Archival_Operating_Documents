This session was more about just catching up.

We looked into what everyone doing on NEAR and in general.
Madhav came up with some questions to figure out WG’s progress, and we all shared our thoughts. 

We also talked about if we are facing any problems or having difficulties with learning the RUST language. Adarsh is not experienced in the tech part he had some problems understanding terminology and overall the book. So Aditya suggested first having a basic understanding of programming, he suggested looking for this: 

[CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-programming-with-python?index=product&queryID=dbe1f6c26e04f011b01e2a562a03c597&position=2)

We discussed our progress with Astro DAO as well. For creating DAO and exploring how Astro DAO works we need assets in our wallet, so we decided to continue on this after we get our stipend.

Before ending the meeting Madhav asked everyone how we could be more active and what we should do to progress. 

### **Things to work on**

- [ ]  Adarsh is gonna write a DAO tooling overview on NEAR
- [ ]  Aditya is gonna write one on Ethereum
