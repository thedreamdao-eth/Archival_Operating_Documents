# Dream DAO on Astro

This is just a braindump but would be fun to implement if everyone is on board!

A while ago while talking to Adarsh, he shared it would be cool to host small meetups for young folks to share about near or maybe host a workshop.

Then recently Amanda shared how we should also focus on others rather than just incentivizing dream dao folks

**How would it be to run a dao on Astro with a small treasury and all the near wg members as its signatories? Anyone could put up a cool idea on how we could use the money and then have a vote.** 

Here are a few things we could tinker with by setting up a dao

- Small bounties that are open to everyone. Tasks could be writing a small blogpost or committing first pull request to open source software!
- Host meetups and workshops with the funds from the dao.
- Make resources and reward people for their contributions.

The first iteration could be likeâ†’

When all the wg members get their first stipends we chip in $50 dollars each and start the experiment.
We start with one Idea and if we get some good output we could maybe find a way to fund the treasury.
