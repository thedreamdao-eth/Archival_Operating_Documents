# Elizabeth Salmeron

About me: I'm a first-year environmental engineering student focusing on energy infrastructure and net-carbon technology. I am a student assistant at my university's engineering makerspace and Texas Explore Head for ClimateScience. I want to explore the possibilities of web3 because its influence goes beyond its intersections in social impact by providing a means to a new world of change. I want to explore the innovative aspect of this new change and what web3 holds possible for new technology.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: As someone who went through a long and difficult journey of self-empowerment in the face of oppression and discrimination, I know how to connect to individuals who are in need of the same values. I know how to find the "invisible." Additionally, my background in civics and the tech space can bring in new skillsets and perspectives that could be lacking among DAO Builders.
