# Noah Schwartz

About me: interested in fair governance- role (if any haha) of markets/financial instruments in steering systems towards egalitarian outcomes.  the Dream Dao premise of orienting around youth leadership by design is intuitive and inspiring to me.

background in arbitrage trading/ this experience makes me sensitive to potential attack vectors in protocol design (not techncial exploits- more systemic misalignments in incentives, tokenomics etc that may be hiding in plain sight)  

sit on 2-person board of Foundation with civics & music education mission- maintains the website: https://www.peertutoringresource.org/ though operationally is in a transitional phase

Other comments: don't know yet.  irl I think a lot about investment/allocation of foundation assets as a way of ensuring long-term operational sustainability without relying on fundraising etc. that said, I'm drawn to the potential of DAOs as a true blank slate, which means designing mechanisms to be optimized for a desired long-term outcome, which likely means operating from a less mercantile/risk-aware mindset. excited to see where it goes. 
I am a...: Crypto enthusiast, Creative
