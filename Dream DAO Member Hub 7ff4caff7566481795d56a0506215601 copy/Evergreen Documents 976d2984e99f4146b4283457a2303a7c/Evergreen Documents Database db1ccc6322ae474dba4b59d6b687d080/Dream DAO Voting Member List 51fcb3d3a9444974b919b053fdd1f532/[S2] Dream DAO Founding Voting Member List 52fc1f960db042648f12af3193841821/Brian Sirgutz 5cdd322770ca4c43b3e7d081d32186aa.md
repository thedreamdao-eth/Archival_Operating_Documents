# Brian Sirgutz

About me: Who am I is a question that is incable of being answered as the whole point of the human experience is to remove all the things that you "think" you, we can realize our full potential. We all need support, strength and as a volunteer on 9/11, launched and sold the first Impact news platform to AOL, helped build one of the biggest and respected online news site with the Huffington Post, I have consistently remade myself as I continue to desolve who I think I should be and allow what I want to exisit in the world.
