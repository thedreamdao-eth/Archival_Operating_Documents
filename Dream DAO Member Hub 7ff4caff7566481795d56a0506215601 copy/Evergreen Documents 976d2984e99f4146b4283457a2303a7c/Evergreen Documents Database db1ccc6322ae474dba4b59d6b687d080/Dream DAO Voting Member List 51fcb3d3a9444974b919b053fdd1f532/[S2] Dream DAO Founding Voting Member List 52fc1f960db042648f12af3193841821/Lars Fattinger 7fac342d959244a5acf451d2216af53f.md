# Lars Fattinger

About me: I‚Äôm a climate activist. I know that might sound weird considering that I‚Äôm applying for a position at an organization that‚Äôs working with crypto. But that‚Äôs exactly why I needed to apply. I want to be the environmental voice of reason in a place where this is much needed. I truly want the Dream DAO and Civics Unplugged to succeed but I don‚Äôt want it to lose what it stands for along the way. About a month ago, I had the honor of representing a Swiss Youth NGO at COP26, the United Nations Climate Change Conference. I‚Äôve heard lots of interesting perspectives and opinions from all around the world during my time there but there is one thing I often hear that I don‚Äôt agree with. We don‚Äôt need to change everything about how our society works, and we don‚Äôt need to suppress innovation. We just need to find ways how to do those things in a sustainable way. The same thing goes for web3. Ethereum Mining is extremely carbon-intensive. One NFT has an estimated carbon footprint of a bit more than one month living like the average European. If you want to go down this path, then it needs to be at least carbon neutral. I think that the idea behind the Dream DAO is interesting and worth exploring further. Web3 will continue to grow and gain importance in our society. So, it is up to us to make this transition as environmentally friendly as possible. Outside of my work in the climate scene, I‚Äôm advocating for LGBTQ+ rights in schools and I‚Äôm currently working on a Civics 2030 Project Proposal with some other Builders.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: As a Dream DAO Builder, I would not only bring my perspective on the Climate issue considering NFTs, but also the motivation to move this mission along. With web3 becoming an extremely important technology, it is beyond important that young people get the resources to explore this new world of opportunities to its fullest. I would combine a critical view with the wish of success and I believe that this could be greatly beneficial for the Dream DAO.
