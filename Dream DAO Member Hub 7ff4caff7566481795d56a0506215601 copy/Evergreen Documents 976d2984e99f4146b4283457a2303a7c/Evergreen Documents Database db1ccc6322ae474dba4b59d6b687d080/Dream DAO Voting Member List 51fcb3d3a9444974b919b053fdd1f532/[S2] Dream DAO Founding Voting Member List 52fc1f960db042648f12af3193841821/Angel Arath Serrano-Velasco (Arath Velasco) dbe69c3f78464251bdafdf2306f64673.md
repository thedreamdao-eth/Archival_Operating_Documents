# Angel Arath Serrano-Velasco (Arath Velasco)

About me: I'm Arath. I care about moving my life forward, after being turned down by the ignorant family I have. I'm alone in this journey but I'm not giving up. I'm determined to pave my own way becuase I know I am capable of learning and applying what I've learned.  I want to dive deep into the world of web3, as this is an essential tool for the future that awaits us. It will be part of our normal lives, so I want to explore this field to generate ways on how to benefit communities. lmao sorry, i had a discussion rn and wanted to vent here.
