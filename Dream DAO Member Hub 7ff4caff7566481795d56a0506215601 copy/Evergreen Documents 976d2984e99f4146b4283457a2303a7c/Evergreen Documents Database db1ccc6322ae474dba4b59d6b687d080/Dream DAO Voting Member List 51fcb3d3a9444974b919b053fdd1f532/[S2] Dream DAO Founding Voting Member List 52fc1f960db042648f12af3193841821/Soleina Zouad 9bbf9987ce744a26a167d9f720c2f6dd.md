# Soleina Zouad

About me: I‚Äôm in my junior year and I am interested in global systems of change and wish to invest myself in more international projects and dynamics. I love meeting people from different backgrounds as we from both sides get a lot to learn from each other, and make an impact in our local communities in return.
I really want to work around climate change, but I am not sure where to start because all the time my parents or friends are asked to be climate conscious, they just turn off lights to save electricity (well you see where this goes). I wish to have a bigger impact, to go beyond the daily actions.
I care a lot about equality as that is an inseparable part of human society. I don‚Äôt think we as human society could ever get a perfect equality but I think we can get closer to it. And I deeply desire to be an actor of our society‚Äôs mutation to a safer place.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: I'm really excited about joining the comunity and i can't wait to learn more about web3. I don't know a lot about web3 but I've been searchung as much information as I could to be the more informed as possible. The more I learn about it the more I like it. I wanted to thank the founders for creating such an amazing opportunity for youth.
Fellowship cohort: Spring 2022
What's your birthday?: May 27, 2005
Can help how?: I would get an opportunity to research community capstone projects, be mentored by champions on a 1:1 basis, as I‚Äôm slightly introverted and I get to learn a lot when we have this 1:1 connection with people who have a lot of experiences to share about finding their you-shaped holes. Through the community‚Äôs support and abundance of ideas I would like to create a local project on climate action which would act as a bridge between local people being connected with Climate solutions globally. The global aspect of community not only allows me to learn together, but learn from our experiences and apply it to our local communities. I love traveling not just because I get to know about cultures but it allows me to bridge perspectives. That being said, I would love being a part of the Gatherings group so that I can help organize, visit and speak at web3 conferences across the world and at the same time tell my local community about the potential of Web3.
