# Akshaya Kodiganti

About me: I am a deeply passionate high school student interested in computer science and entrepreneurship. I have also adored cars since I was a kid. My dad used to explain to me about cars, the models and the features of the cars everytime we went to their showroom. This developed my further interest in cars. Entrepreneurship came to me naturally, I always wanted to lead teams and guide people. Perhaps, my dad’s work inspired me. But looking at others lead passionate teams made me more passionate about this particular interest of mine. I have also been an introvert, it has been hard starting conversations but once I get to know my peers, I interact normally with them. Interacting with people hasn’t been tough because I don’t care about if people judge me,because people online have been very supportive. Additionally, I am an enthusiastic, funny and empathetic person. My mom has always taught me to be kind and I started developing empathy towards others, I have helped out at local NGOs too! Besides all this, I am also interested in engineering and have taken science subjects in my senior secondary to hopefully major in computer science engineering in the future.
