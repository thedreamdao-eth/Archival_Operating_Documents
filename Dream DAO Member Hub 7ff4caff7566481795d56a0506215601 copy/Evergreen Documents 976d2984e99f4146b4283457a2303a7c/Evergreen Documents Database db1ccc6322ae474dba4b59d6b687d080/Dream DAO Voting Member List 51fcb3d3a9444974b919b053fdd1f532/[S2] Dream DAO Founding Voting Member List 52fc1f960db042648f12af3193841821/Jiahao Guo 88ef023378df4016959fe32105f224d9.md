# Jiahao Guo

About me: I'm Jiahao, from rural Ohio, a rising freshman of international relations at the American University in Bulgaria, and I'm incredibly passionate about international and intercultural education. I am the founder of an organization, Concourse International, an organization aimed at making intercultural education through virutal exchanges accessible to more high school students, anda part and grant recipient of the Civics Unplugged 2030 Strategy. Currently, I am concluding a gap year where I volunteered at a heritage steam railway in rural Wales, taught English in rual Brazil, and participated in a host of online programs, including The Experiment Digital, Stanford SPICE China Scholars Program, Sejong Korea Scholars Program, Global Citizen Year Academy, Global Changemakers Mentorship Program, The Smithsonian Museum of the American Latino Young Ambassadors Program, and Civics Unplugged. I am also interning online at GoodParty and FairShare, later interning this summer at the Childrens' Discovery Museum in San Jose California, and teaching conversational online on http://italki.com/. Through all of these experiences, I am hoping to deepen my knowledge and experience in international relations, politics, civic participation, and mutual understanding.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: Recently my grandmother suffered a stroke and is now left in stable condition, but cannot talk or move again. I submitted this application a day late, and hope that my application can be considered.
Fellowship cohort: Spring 2022
What's your birthday?: January 10, 2003
Can help how?: I am greatly excited to participate in the Explorers Program to be able to not only limit myself to generic principles of self study which I have gained from YouTube and Wikipedia, but instead to learn by doing and being involved with an actual web3 organization. From here, it will serve as a launching pad to be able to organize more events to collaborate with other individuals and contribute to make web3 more accessible to all. But it all starts from the experience that I can gain by getting involved.
