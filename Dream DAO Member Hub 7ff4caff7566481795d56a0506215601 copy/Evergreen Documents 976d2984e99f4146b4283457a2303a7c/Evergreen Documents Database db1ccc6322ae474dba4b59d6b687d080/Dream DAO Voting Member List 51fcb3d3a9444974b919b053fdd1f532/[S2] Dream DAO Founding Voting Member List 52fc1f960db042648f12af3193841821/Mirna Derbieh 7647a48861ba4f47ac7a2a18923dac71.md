# Mirna Derbieh

About me: I'm a high school senior passionate about various topics as mental health, Women's rights and food insecurity. I love learning new things and working with groups, and I care about making our world a better place. I think web3 is absolutely an amazing idea for raising funds and using them for good, especially that it don't depends on somebody's financial state and consequently everyone can contribute in making change.
