# Harry (AKA PlantBoi)

About me: I am a recent first class biochemistry graduate, plant obsessor and adventurer! I care about rethinking the broken scientific system, and using web3 as the platform to allow arguably the worlds greatest public good (scientific research) to be a greater benefit to all. I also want to explore ways to move beyond no-utility NFT projects with false promises, and start exploring ways to use NFTs in high impact ways to support areas such as conservation and biodiversity preservation, provision of UBI through ReFi mechanisms and supporting jobs for local communities.
My current work life is primarily as project lead at the web3 project PLANT GANG, where we're building the first herbarium of the metaverse, a scientifically accurate collection of scientific 3D model NFTs from real-world scanned plant specimens, which can be collected, stored and accessed on the blockchain in an immutable way.
This project sits within the emerging and exciting DeSci space, which on a wider scale offers a way to change the broken scientific strucutures of publishing, funding and data control. I am enganged in this space, visiting DeSci conferences and following its latest developments and would love to introduce young and interested minds to this space, which in a time of web3 skepticism, offers an exciting and impactful application of blockchain technology to show the world.
I have previous experience in mentorship roles, working at a school as a special educational needs teacher and love interacting with people and finding out about what makes them inspired!

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: I am comfortable speaking with communities, so as I become more involved with Dream DAO I could potentially be used for spreading its mission in talks, podcasts, twitter spaces etc
I also like writing pieces on mirror etc, so might also jump on writing/editing bounties when I have time!
If you ever need more onboarding members, I also really enjoy engaging with new members and finding out about what they do and how they can best fit into communities.
