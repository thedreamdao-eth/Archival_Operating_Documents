# Dave Kim

About me: Hey! I'm Dave. By day, I'm a program officer on the financial services for the poor team at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. I lead our work on ensuring that low-income individuals and communities have an easy, affordable, and trusted way to access and benefit from the digital economy. 

Outside of that, I started Future Foundation as a way to support web3 x social impact organizations, causes, and the broader ecosystem.
