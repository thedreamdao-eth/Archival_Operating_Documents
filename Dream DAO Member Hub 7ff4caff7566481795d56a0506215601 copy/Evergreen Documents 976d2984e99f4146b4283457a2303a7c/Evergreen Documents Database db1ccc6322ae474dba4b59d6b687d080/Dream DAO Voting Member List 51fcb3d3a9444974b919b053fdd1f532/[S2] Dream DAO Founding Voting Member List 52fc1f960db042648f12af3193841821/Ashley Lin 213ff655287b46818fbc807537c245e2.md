# Ashley Lin

About me: I‚Äôm Ashley, 18 from Portland OR, on a gap year(s) from Penn‚Äôs M&T program to make sense of the world and figure out how I can do good within it. 

I am trying to create incentives (grants, fellowships, communities) that get more talented young people working on things that improve the long-term future. I work at the Centre for Effective Altruism, am co-founding an EA version of the Thiel Fellowship for HS students, and love community building (I‚Äôm slightly obsessed with making sure the right people meet each other). Came across DAOs while writing a book on digital-first community building, spearheaded CU‚Äôs early partnerships with EF, and am pretty interested in crypto‚Äôs various governance experiments.
