# Fernando Cruz

About me: My name is Fernando Cruz, I am 18 years old, and I live in Mexico City.
Currently, I have finished my last year of high school and I am about to study Economics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the highest house of studies in my country, one of the best universities in Latin America, and one of the 100 best universities in the world.
In addition to school, one of my passions is music, I currently know how to play the piano and I'm learning to play the guitar, plus I like to sing and for a few years, I've been part of the choir of a youth orchestra in Mexico.
During these last years, in addition to school and music, I have been part of different organizations and social projects both in Mexico and abroad (Civics Unplugged, Ivy House, Rise for the World, B√©calos), as well as different programs and courses of leadership and social entrepreneurship that I have had the good fortune to take, such as the Civics Unplugged Fellowship given by Civics Unplugged and the Human Leadership Program given by Ivy House.
Honestly, in recent years I have reflected a lot about what matters to me and what interests me in my life and I have come to the conclusion that I love and am passionate about many things, including music and finances, but above all, I am interested in learning and being able to develop my skills to help others, I feel that this is what has defined me as a person, being someone who is always curious to learn new things.
