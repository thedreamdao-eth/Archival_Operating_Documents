# Havish Senthilkumar

About me: I'm a passionate individual whose goal is to make a significant impact in the world. I take my education very seriously and do my best to learn from my teachers and excel academically. I enjoy volunteering and helping out my community and I recently recieved a officer position in a club at my school so I can involve and recruit more people to volunteer in our community. I care about the future of our society the most and the direction it's going right now is a dark one with problems like climate change and world hunger becoming more prominent. I want to change this and make these problems disappear and leave a mark in this world that won't be forgotten.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: Ever since I was in middle school I was always intruiged by Bitcoin and other crypto and how they work, but I never found a clear answer. This curiosity has carried into my life until now with NFT's and etc. However I always felt intimidated by the vast amount of information online and often overwhelmed, through Dream DAO I went to make this leap and discover what crypto, the blockchain, and NFT's are and how they are related as well as implementations of them to make our world better.
Fellowship cohort: Spring 2022
What's your birthday?: August 20, 2006
Can help how?: I will make the best use out of the resources given to me by putting forth my best effort and attention during learning sessions while participating during the discussions and giving my opinions when asked for. I will take the opportunities that are offered to me through Dream DAO such as the IRL meetings to experience web3 firsthand and share my experiences with others. Along the way I want to meet new people through Dream DAO who share similar goals to mine and work with them to create that impact in the world I've always wanted to do as well as create long lasting connections to further work together in the future as well.
