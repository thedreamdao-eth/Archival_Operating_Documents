# Aryan Tiwari

About me: I am Aryan Tiwari, a class 12 Science student studying in Zydus School for Excellence, Vejalpur, Ahmedabad. The fields of philosophy, psychology and politics pique my interest as they unlock the intricacies of humans. And I also like to dabble in web development, music and poetry composition.
Recently, I have been diving deeper into personality psychology through videos, articles and research papers. To get a better understanding of this field, I am doing an internship with Professor Jaison Manjaly at the Indian institute of Technology, Gandhinagar to assist him with a research project based on Curiosity and Feedback. Through my 6 week internship, I explored the intersection of personality and curiosity. I conducted a survey of more than 150 people where I leveraged existing questionnaires to find and validate a correlation. Through the open sourced IPIP version of the Big Five Aspect Scale by Goldberg and a questionnaire on Epistemic Curiosity by Litman, I found a strong correlation between the two factors.
Through this internship, I am learning to efficiently read and analyze research papers in order to perform a thorough prior literature review. I also learnt to present my findings as research papers, posters and presentations. I will also be presenting my research results to an audience in the college soon.

Can help how?: The opportunities and resources at DreamDAO are endless and many cater to my needs for growth. I‚Äôm especially interested in the Explorers Program that provides first hand experience into the crypto world and lets us get experience. One of my major goals is to get financial independence and through DreamDAO, I can avail internships and other opportunities to excel my ambition.
I also look forward to getting mentorship support for my future endeavors. As I love to code, I'll be able to learn from the experts and help my fellow builders to build a better environment. The Learning Together Sessions will enable me to find my interests and niche while also interactively learning from the community.
Crypto exploration through NFTs. I love to make music NFTs - have a look at my collection here https://opensea.io/0x33F56609bfED249E59eE2F6a342ACbb85C300882
At DreamDAO, I want to explore NFTs and their social impact. Being a musician and composer, I find it really frustrating to live in a capitalistic world where the music industry is ruled by big label companies. Through decentralization, the power can be transferred to the musicians who deserve to own their art and appreciation. I am really enthusiastic about revolutionizing the music industry using Web3 technology. This is something I would love to explore to the full extent at DreamDAO
