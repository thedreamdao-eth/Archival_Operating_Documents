# Shivika Kumar

About me: I am a rising senior in hgh school that lives in a conservative town but has very liberal views. I have always been passionate about gender equality and activism. Through exploring activism I found other causes to be passionate about such as reproductive rights, all kinds of equality, and the climate crisis. I participate in program that provide women with resources for thier STEM careers, platforms that showcase women's stories and thier voices, and other community ptojects that uphold gender equality and mindfulness of the enviroment. I have been trying to get more oppurtunities in climate activism. A key fact about myself is that I belive in creating spaces for unheard voices to speak in rather than speaking for them.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: I am excited to see a program like DreamDao existing because it is a one-of-a-kind program which combines learning with real-world experince.

Can help how?: I have very little knowledge about the web3 space and everything it holds. Dream DAO's learning oppurtunites will help educate me about this space and how it works. Also, the networking opputunities will be an amazing avenue for getting to know real-world experince in web3 and how it works in tandem with the other industries and institutions that the world already posseses.
