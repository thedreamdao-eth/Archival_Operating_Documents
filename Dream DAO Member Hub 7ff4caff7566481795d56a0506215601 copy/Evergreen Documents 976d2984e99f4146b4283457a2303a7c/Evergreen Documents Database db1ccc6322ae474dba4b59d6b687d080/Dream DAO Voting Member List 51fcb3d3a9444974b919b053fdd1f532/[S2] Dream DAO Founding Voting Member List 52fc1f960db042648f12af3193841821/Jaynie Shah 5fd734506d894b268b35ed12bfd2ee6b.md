About me: I am curious, analytical and passionate 18 year old is excited wants to be driven by new opinions, ideas and experiences. Whilst I am still exploring my core values and passions, one thing I truly believe is that by challenging yourself, your able to learn more about yourself and the world around you. In my free time I love running, shows about food and reading. One of the things on my bucket list is to be fluent in French and if I were to be any character it would be Doctor Who.
I have finished secondary school here in the UK, hoping to go to university if I get the grades on results day. I am an active member of Stemettes (social enterprise which encourages girls and young women to pursue careers in STEM) as I am Social Media Consultant for the Youth Board and have engaged with the society for over two years now. The gender inequalities is a topic I care about since as a someone who studies maths, I empathise with others who struggle with confidence to study these subjects and how many women in other countries don't even get the opportunity to study them in the first place. At school, I started the first STEM club and seeing the younger girls have someone to look up as well as have a place to explore these interests highlighted the need for this issue to be talk
I am also passionate about volunteering and think that it's one of the most valuable experiences one can do. I volunteered as a teaching assistant where I taught English to migrants in Brent. I was able to teach them the skills to communicate in English but at the same time I learnt about their journeys to the UK and their career.

Can help how?: From what I have experienced so far, the dream DAO is a powerhouse of people who are all open to collaborating and helping each other understand the potential Web3 holds for the future. Everyone's questions and ideas are already so inspiring which makes me even more excited to join this season. Through the learning together sessions, I hope delve into deeper conversations that will open my mind to new ideas of the importance of Web3 in creating a better future. They will also be a great way of asking questions in a suitable environment as well as introducing myself to Web3 concepts. From the two I attended already, I was telling my friends all about it and I cannot wait to see what other things I learn. I will be sure to attend as many as I can in order for me to get a broader outlook on Web3.
I read about the Explorer's programme and WOW, it seems to be an incredible way to utilise the knowledge learn and your skills in real world situations. Having had the experience of what the fellowship in spring offered, the opportunities that will come in the DAO seem unreal! Being able to work intensively with an organisation over two months will allow you to grow personally and academically.
I hope to develop my communication and creative thinking skills to improve my knowledge about how we can take smaller steps to making a positive societal change.
