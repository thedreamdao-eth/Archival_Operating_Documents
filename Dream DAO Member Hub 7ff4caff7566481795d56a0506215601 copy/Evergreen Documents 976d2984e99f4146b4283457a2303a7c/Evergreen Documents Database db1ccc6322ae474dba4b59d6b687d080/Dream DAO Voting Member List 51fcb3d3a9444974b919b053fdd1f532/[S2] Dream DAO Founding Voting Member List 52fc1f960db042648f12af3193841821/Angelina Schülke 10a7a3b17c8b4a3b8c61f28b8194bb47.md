# Angelina Sch√ºlke

About me: One month ago, I left the small village in the south of Germany where I had grown up and moved to Berlin for an internship at a foundation in the education sector. My initial intention was to gain some work experience in the foundation and non-profit area as well as help organize workshops that would help students from non-academic backgrounds to find their dream major and navigate the college application process. What I didn‚Äôt imagine, though, is how valuable and transformative this whole experience would actually be. Taking a gap year has given me the opportunity to finally immerse myself in everything I‚Äôm interested in ‚Äì ranging from art over philosophy to linguistics, community building and democracy ‚Äì and to start looking at a bigger picture through drawing new connections between those topics. What drives me is the fascination for interdisciplinary questions. And this is also why the Dream DAO has caught my attention. Combining web3 and social impact means connecting the dots in a different way. It means raising questions and ideas that extend and challenge my thinking and that is exactly what I was looking for in my gap year. While I haven‚Äôt really had the chance to learn something about web3 before, I am convinced that web3 paired with social impact purposes has an enormous potential for the future. Civics Unplugged has inspired me to give back to society and I would like to spread this spirit among other young people as well. That‚Äôs why I am determined to be on the forefront of this innovative path and help design it, instead of just sitting in the sidelines watching someone else attempting to do so.

Who is one person you DO personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: Especially over the course of the Spring Fellowship I got the chance to regularly chat with Carmen Reisdorf and this has honestly been one of the best parts of the entire fellowship for me. What I really love about our conversations is how Carmen always manages to make me view a certain topic from a new angle. Be it cultural differences or societal trends - her questions have pushed me to think deeper about a topic and articulate my own viewpoint clearly and precisely. 
Other than Carmen, I could imagine Vivien Riener because I know she is working with aspiring social entrepreneurs on a daily basis and I feel like she could be interested in Dream DAO¬¥s mission to use web3 for good. I¬¥m not sure if she would have enough time to contribute to it but I think she might like the idea and maybe has some connections as she is working at the so-called ‚Äúsocial innovation lab‚Äù in Germany. She was my Guide during the Spring Fellowship and I loved talking and discussing with her because she is super open and tried to help us whenever she could. 

Who is one person you DON'T personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: In case Baratunde Thurston is not already involved in the Dream DAO, I would suggest asking him to join, too. He seems to be a very cool person with a lot of experience in the media and with public speaking, who¬¥s not afraid to ask and discuss a wide range of subjects. Also, I think he partnered with CU in the past anyway.
Also, I would propose Jenk Oz, a young social entrepreneur from the UK, as a potential new partner. He is known for empowering Gen Z as well, which is why he might be interested in joining our Dream DAO and its mission of combining weg3 and social impact. Having founded his media platform at a very young age, he¬¥s managed to gather a pretty big audience in the meantime. So in case of a successful partnership, this wide reach might be beneficial for the Dream DAO as well. Additionally,  I could imagine that his expertise in the field of social media and effectively reaching fellow GenZers is very valuable for further progress of the DAO. Additionally, he could encourage and inspire DAO builders to dig deeper into social entrepreneurship.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: I wouldn‚Äôt underestimate the value of bringing an international (more precisely a German) perspective to the table. Both my experiences with CU and Global Ciitzen Year Academy (GCYA) have shown me that it can be very enriching to hear from many diverse opinions and I can imagine very well that this is also very important for the further development of the DAO. GCYA has helped me to become a bit more attentive and sensitive to inclusivity issues, which I consider very important for a flourishing community. So, this could be something that I¬¥ll advocate for within this community.  
Another strength of mine is communication, and through being a CU Guide I also had the opportunity to learn how to moderate and facilitate deeper conversations like in the Juntos. In the context of the Dream DAO, I think this could be useful since everything is about interactions and collaboration and being able to articulate one¬¥s ideas clearly is key for progress.
