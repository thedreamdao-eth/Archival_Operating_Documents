# Valeria Francisca Zambrano Ramirez

About me: I‚Äôm a resilient, optimistic and empathetic girl from Chiclayo, Peru; I‚Äôm first-generation college student, coming from a low-income background but always prone to take advantage of every opportunity I carry, when I was in high school because of my effort I could be awarded with a government scholarship to carry out the International Baccalaurate, this was my first glance toward social impact, but in my gap year I was able to expand this vision not only to explore my passions but to find new interests . Currently I‚Äôm the founder and president of a social project focused on bridging the gap between Girls and STEM fields and I‚Äôm involved in a community called Chicas en Tec (Girls in Tech), where I am working in team to solve a health&wellbeing problem with an app. Besides, I love taking pictures to the nature, more than listening to music to relax myself, feeling the music, I love my pets, and hanging out with people make me feel comfortable, I always care about people surrounding me, I am fascinated to experience diversity, service and love in humanity just with acts of kindness.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: I would love to be part of this family.
Fellowship cohort: Fall 2021
What's your birthday?: May 16, 2003
Can help how?: What I love of DREAM DAO is about Learning and Work opportunities, first of all learning because I am ambitious girl seeking for knowledge and wisdom to apply it in real life and actually make the change happen, besides I love connecting with other people that enrich my perspective of observing life, as I‚Äôm open minded. On the other hand, it would be amazing to get a paid internship or a job within a company because it is aligned with my purpose in life and getting paid to do so would be so rewarding for me, as a young adult I have the duty of supporting to my family economically for all the effort they had done for me, that‚Äôs why I think DREAM DAO is a perfect for me in both sides.
