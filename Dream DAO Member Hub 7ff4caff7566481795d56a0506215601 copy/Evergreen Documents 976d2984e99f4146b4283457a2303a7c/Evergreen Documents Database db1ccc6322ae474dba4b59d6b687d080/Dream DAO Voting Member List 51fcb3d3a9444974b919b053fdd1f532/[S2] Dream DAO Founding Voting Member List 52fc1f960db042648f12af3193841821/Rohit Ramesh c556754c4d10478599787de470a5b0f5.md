# Rohit Ramesh

About me: Hello, I'm Rohit, I'm a 3rd year university student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering. I am currently doing a Research Internship at University of Toronto, I was selected for a funded research grant which allowed me to move to Toronto from India (where I live) temporarily. I also love software development. I am fairly new to Blockchain and Web 3 space, and I am trying to learn more about it. I care about making real-world contribution, not just by building something that people can use but by building something that promotes a social cause, enriches lives and will also potentially help the world. That's something that I am genuine about and am working towards. I personally don't think I have had the opportunity to be a part of something like that, but I will surely thrive to be. You could say that the research I am doing will somehow contribute to Academia and can indirectly be used for a good cause, but I'm not satisfied with just that. I wanna do more and I know I am capable of helping more people. At the end of the day, when I look back and see the number of people I helped, no matter how little it was, I'll still be happy and smiling about it and will also want to try harder the next day. Other than that, I love weightlifting, music and reading. I also love to travel and talk to people about their experiences, cause that helps me learn new things. I look at life with the perspective that the other person you are talking to has something to teach you, this is something my dad taught me.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: I'm 20 years old, I don't know if I am eligible or not for this, but I still think it isn't too late for me to try and apply as this will finally grant me a chance to build something that may have a huge social impact. I'm still in University doing my undergrad and I wanna try my best to be a part of Dream DAO as a builder and then someday, eventually work my way towards becoming a Dream DAO Champion.
What's your birthday?: October 7, 2001
Can help how?: The mentorship given will help me learn new things, work on my skills, and give me proper guidance to accomplish my goals. The fact that there will be other builders who may be more skilled, smarter and diverse will allow me to learn from them and grow not only as a builder but also as a person. The community seems to be very supportive, friendly and approachable, and that is a place that I want to be in because that's the type of energy that we need to make a social impact. I would also love to be a part of the organizing team that hosts events in real life, and help bring in more regens and encourage them to work on creating something that has a social impact. The learning together sessions seem great, I attended one with Marcus from Cohere a few days back and I absolutely loved it. And I would definitely want more of them because the speakers who come seem to be working on the same cause that we are working on. I believe that if I redeem myself, I will also be given a chance to fly out to a Web 3 conference, that's also something I look forward to as it will help me meet new builders from different backgrounds.
