# Eleanor Deverell

About me: I am a 17 year old rising senior in high school who yearns to contribute to the creation of a sustainable and ethical digital future where individuals are in control of their own data. Academically, I am drawn towards psychology and sociology. My hope is to use this interest to take part in the journey of evolving the World Wide Web to advance our world by understanding how emerging tech will affect our interactions between each other and the world in which we reside. I live in Oakland, California with my two rescue dogs, mom, and brother. In my free time I love to swim, play water polo, and coach on my swim team which I have been a part of for many years. I also enjoy spending time researching what drives individuals to act in support of society versus against it.
