# Alejandra Borda

About me: I am Ale, originally from Peru, currently studying entrepreneurship. I am passionate about all things social impact, I've started Sigueme Voluntariado, an NGO in the poorest slums of Peru, we built 25 houses and 16 staircases. I then started Enseñame and scaled an online platform to bring one-on-one education to children in Peru whose schools closed as they had no resources to provide online classes. It scaled to 3000 kids tutored by 3000 tutors within 5 months and many professional psychologists, teachers ad big companies CSR initiatives such as IBM joined the mission to support our volunteers. My role in both NGOs was in the strategic, coordinating, and executing side to lead the teams.  This summer I interned at Fifty Years, a VC supporting entrepreneurs solving worlds problems (literally if the impact was not the end goal, it was a pass) and currently exploring my next entrepreneurial endeavour. My passion for impact started through helping these communities but I am very excited about health in particular. I am fascinated about optimizing our biology so we no longer have disease through the right nutrition, meditation, syncing our circadian rhythm, fasting, cold exposure, and choosing the actions that are individually right for each person's unique biology. We have stirred away from nature so much and lost touch with our internal biology hence creating disease. I see web3 brings immense opportunity to bring finance to the unbanked, job opportunities with those with less access to education, to use finance as a means to regenerate our environment and to create communities that can pursue passions and create value for the planet while also being rewarded for it. I see web3 as the opportunity to shift away from traditional ineffective nonprofit activity into a radical systemic change through community and redefining processes but still need a community of other builders and mentors in the space to achieve this mission.

Who is one person you DON'T personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: Naveen Jain has an incredible perspective on solving the world's problems, he approaches each industry with a beginners mind to ask the questions someone who is an expert in the field would see as dumb but lead to completely innovative solutions to solve problems. He founded Viome (healthcare) and Moon Express (space exploration).

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: Achieving massive impact has been the driving force of every decision I have made, my efforts are always motivated by the idea that each learning will allow me to become an even better leader for change in the future. Web3 has the massive potential not only for creating economies that drive the regeneration of ecosystems and how we interact with one another but also opens opportunities for massive coordination for positive change. I am super excited for the opportunity to leverage this and move masses or create processes that enable this new future to occur. I also want to be a source of value for other Fellows in the program connecting them to people they might benefit from leading, sharing my deep knowledge on conscious leadership, meditation, inner exploration and how to make sure teams are growing as much personally as the project grows or simply being a brainstorm partner for others on their journey. While I would be thrilled to join as a fellow and have this insanely good learning and implementing experience to drive an impactful project though. If not accepted into the fellowship I would love to chat with the team and jam on how can I bring value and help to bring this vision to reality, I would be more than excited in helping with the DAO operations and scale impact through investing in young people.
