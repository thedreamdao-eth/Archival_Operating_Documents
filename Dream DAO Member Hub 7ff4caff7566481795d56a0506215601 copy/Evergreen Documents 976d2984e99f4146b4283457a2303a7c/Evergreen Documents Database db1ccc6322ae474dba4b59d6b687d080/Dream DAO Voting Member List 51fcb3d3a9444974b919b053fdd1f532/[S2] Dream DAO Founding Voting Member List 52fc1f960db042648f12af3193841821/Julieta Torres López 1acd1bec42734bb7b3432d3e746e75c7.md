# Julieta Torres L√≥pez

About me: I am a Mexican activist, currently focused on the education system and women's rights in my country. My main activities in recent years have been to turn around the Mexican youth with a vision and learning towards financial education, mental health, self-knowledge and leadership. On the other hand, I am concerned about women's rights and eradicating an unfortunate problem that still exists in the world, female genital mutilation. I think that being able to solve these problems aI am a Mexican activist, currently focused on the education system and women's rights in my country.

On the other hand, I am concerned about women's rights and eradicating an unfortunate problem that still exists in the world, female genital mutilation. I think that being able to solve these problems and help these causes motivate me in my day-to-day life and has defined me as the person I am now and the person I want to become in the future. Making a difference and the power that we have shown the youth in these last generations.

Can help how?: I will make the best use of the resources and opportunities that the Dream DAO provides because, not only is it an international community that will help me to broaden and learn more about the perspectives that young people from different countries have about the issues I am currently focusing on. These resources, such as the Learning Together and IRL Regen Web3 Gathering sessions will help me contribute to my research and personal activism, leaving not only knowledge in myself but in the whole community in my projects on education and women's rights.
Other comments: Yes, I would like to add that I am really excited to be able to apply for this opportunity. I want to thank you for all your support and effort in the planned sessions we had, I really learned a lot about web3 and other topics that are immersed in it. Finally, I would like to ask you a quick question that would help me a lot to know more about DreamDAO. Who is the best person you would consider having on your team?
