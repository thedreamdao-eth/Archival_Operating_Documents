About me: I was born and raised in the rural highlands of The Land of Eternal Trees, also known as Guatemala. Growing up in one of the worldâ€™s most stunning yet devastatingly unequal countries in the world, my life has been driven by learning, dreaming, and creating a world that is inspired in abundance and equality. I seek to channel the power of culture, world-changing technologies, and human connection to make this dream a reality. Bitcoin has been on my radar since 2013. I began going down the rabbit hole a few years back and throughout the course of the last year, I began to take this budding interest into fostering a much more informed and applicable set of knowledge. Naturally, I took the first step I thought was right, which was to join a crypto startup known as Zash (http://joinzash.com/). Zash is a socially-driven investment platform that seeks to interface social media, investment execution, and community-driven knowledge sharing to provide investors with alpha-led strategies developed by key investment strategists - at Zash, I was leading Community efforts. Aside from doing some trading, I also love exploring new crypto projects that I sincerely feel have real value-add to society. I collaborate and contribute where I can with these communities, and have been a part of some exciting DAO's - including part of the core team at CityDAO (http://citydao.io/), where we are tokenizing land on the blockchain and am also developing an impact-led NFT strategy with CitizenDAO (http://citizendao.com/). As of late, I am spending my time primarily with Cohere (cohere.network) - where we're building out regenerative innovation hubs powered by web3.
I've witnessed first-hand the real harms that centralized power can bring to society - Guatemala's socio-economic landscape is mired in rampant inequality that stems as a consequence of centuries-old discrimination and exclusion. I am deeply passionate about the potential of Web3 to provide a platform and solution to address this existential problem we face. Web3 enables anyone, without barriers to access a better shared world. A world where value is distributed with more consideration to those around us, our vocation is fostered, and our community is nurtured. Web3 promises and delivers on this and so much more. I am incredibly excited about the future of this space and believe that DreamDAO is playing and will play an increasingly important role in fostering innovative ways of deploying Web3 solutions around the world - particularly aimed towards supporting youth. My passion is to be able to onboard more youth from Latin America into the space, with which I would love to explore an opportunity with DreamDAO!

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: I'm super excited by what's being built here. My passions are led by adventure and curiosity and I'd love to be able to explore how we can leverage more IRL interactions throughout DreamDAO.
I am an avid outdoors person with a deep interest in enabling solutions to address environmental degradation. Some of my most inspirational and moving moments have been deep in tropical jungles, on high cliffs, and in valleys. Protecting these ecosystems is incredibly valuable to me, and I feel called through my practice of adventure sports (surfing, rock climbing, scuba) to be an advocate for more harmonious relations with the earth.
My curiosity has led me to continually seek new perspectives on the worlds we all inhabit. With this in mind, I have traveled extensively, spent late nights reading (currently working on: The Four Agreements and The Tao of Physics), found resonance in music - express through song and guitar playing, among other creative endeavours!
Can help how?: Funding from network, Learning and/or work opportunities, Mentoring youth and their projects
I am a...: Hyperconnector, Web3 Founder/core contributor, Crypto enthusiast, Philanthropist
