# Jon Ruth

About me: I am a dreamer and I believe anything is possible. I would love to spend time with Dream DAO/Gen Z builders imagining the future they want to create! I am the founder of Spark Eco and have over 15 years of experience developing, managing, and constructing large utility-scale solar power projects. I have been involved in the cryptocurrency space since 2016, including mining various cryptocurrencies. I am a passionate art collector and have been collecting physical art for several years. I bought my first NFT in 2017, but it wasnâ€™t until 2021 that I saw the possibilities NFT's provide to artists. For 20+ years I have studied climate change, and I have a passion for building sustainable solutions to one of the most significant challenges humanity faces. I am on a mission to make the maximum positive impact possible in the fight against climate change.
