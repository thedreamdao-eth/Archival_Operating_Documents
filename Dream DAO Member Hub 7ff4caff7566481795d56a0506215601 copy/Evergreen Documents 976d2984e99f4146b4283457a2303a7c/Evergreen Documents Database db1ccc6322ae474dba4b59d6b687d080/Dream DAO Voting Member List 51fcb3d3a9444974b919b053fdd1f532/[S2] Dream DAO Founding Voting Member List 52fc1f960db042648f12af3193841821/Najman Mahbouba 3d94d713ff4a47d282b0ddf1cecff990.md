About me: Upon first becoming interested in public policy and legislation at age 15, I fervently desired the chance of gaining real-life experience, but no reliable think tanks consider 15-year-olds for positions listed online, no matter how passionate or motivated they are. Slightly disappointed, but not unmotivated I took initiative by cold emailing around 100 public policy think tanks, giving a short pitch on why they should take a chance on a seemingly crazy high school freshman for an internship. 99 declined, but the President of the California Policy Center appreciated my passion and offered me a legislative internship - the rest is history.It's quite obvious that I am a huge public policy fanatic and nerd, an interest that often defines me and one that I have intricately involved myself with. But my English teacher always told me to show, not tell, so that is what I will do below by sharing some of my past experiences:I serve as a Policy Advocate for the Harvard University School of Public Health and San Jose State University Human Rights Institute for example, where we aim to translate scientific medical research into quantifiable legislative policy. I also am the Organization Director of The Policy Initiatives Institute, a prominent youth-run legislative educational nonprofit organization where I lead a team of 110 passionate high school students in enacting and educating about policy and legislative change. We have had over 40 policy articles published, 9 nationwide policy campaigns held, connected with 15 partners, and reached 50 countries. Additionally, I am also deeply involved in the academic side of public policy, having received a full residential scholarship to UC Santa Barbara for the 2022 summer to reside on campus for a month and conduct academic public policy research. Lastly, I serve on numerous town and district level commissions and boards, including the 18th Congressional District Advisory Board, and have had award-winning public policy writing published on numerous platforms, including the Stanford University Daily.Aside from this, I am also interested in academic scientific research, and how we can lessen the divide between research and the legislation that passes law-making institutions across the world. Lastly, I also deeply enjoy music, playing the piano, guitar, and ukulele, and like to read and exercise in my free time.
