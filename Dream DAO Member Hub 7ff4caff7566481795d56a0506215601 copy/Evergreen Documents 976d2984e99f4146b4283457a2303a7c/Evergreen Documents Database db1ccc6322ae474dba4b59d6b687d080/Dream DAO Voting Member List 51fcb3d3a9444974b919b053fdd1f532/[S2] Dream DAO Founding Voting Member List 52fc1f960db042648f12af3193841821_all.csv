I run a start-up ThingFinder(tag-device to help Alzheimer patients & elderly keep track of their day-to-day objects), which is incubated at GUSEC, and have raised about $4000 in grants for it.
https://to.aabhass.in/ThingFinder
Having participated in 20+ international hackathons and won 7 (3 MIT-Challenges), I have got to expand my network and furnish my skills. And through global communities, I have been able to expand my horizon of perspectives.
I have worked through Social Entrepreneurship and Hardware-Development, to devise solutions towards solving issues of Alzheimer’s, Mental-Health, Data-Bias in Clinical-Research, Emergency Safety, Accessibility of Health-Care & Education.
I have been working as an advisory board member of UNICEF’s Young People’s Action Team, to raise voices of youth in policy advocacy and applying efforts like YoungWarrior Movement at the grass-root level. And it has been great being a bridge between youth and UNICEF.
https://to.aabhass.in/UNICEF
I am also part of Human Impacts Institute's Youth Advisory Council, working towards climate artivism and youth advocacy for the same.
I also sometimes blog with friends, exchanging views on socio-psychological issues to bring a positive impact, and also have community discussion to burst my own bubbles and learn new perspective of the world to navigate better. Here on https://beyondbubble.org/
I feel that “Everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler”. In life, satisfaction is the key, and you can get satisfaction by giving rather than taking, this is what keeps me motivated to improve the world.
I believe creating an impact depends on changing mindsets, best achieved through “true education”. I want to work towards implementing this change I envision. I believe that although the world has many intelligent people, it needs wise people mostly because the attitude and effective implementation matters even more than innovation. Implementation is more important and relevant than knowing. I think that we need to realize that death is the ultimate truth of life and need to embrace the uncertainty, which will help us be much more benevolent and treat everyone better to make it a better place. And one of the best tools to achieve the same is through Openness and Benevolence, and I beleive that being decentralised (i.e. amall local quanta interconnected to each other), whoch would greta significantly to step out of echo chambers through tools like AI, and benevolence being gimbibed through our educations systems would ensure that we as humanity contribute our bit to the larger shceme of universe.
I am also one of the 100 RISE Global Winners, who will be supported for a lifetime from education to social initiatives by Schmidt Futures and Rhodes Trust to create impact in their communities.

Recently I have been doing a research internship at IIT Gandhingagar, where I have been working on electronics and hardware end to develop accesible lung health diagnostic devices through masks using sensors to monitor breath data using microphones and carbon dioxide sensors.
https://to.aabhass.in/publication
My fascination has particualrly been around intersection of Entrpreneurship, Hardware Technology and Philosophy, more specifically learning science and innovation through the lens of philosophy to ensure that intent meets it's impact, and ""effective altruism"" through benevolence and openness can be practiced. I particularly feels inspired through the ocncept of Oneness, and how we are part of the greater conciousness and destiny and how this transience in life, can help us to develop fearless optimisim and give our best.
Here's my TEDx Talk below where is hare about my steps of developing a vision beyond bubbles for life and how I want to go about creating that impact I envision.
TEDx Talk – https://to.aabhass.in/ted
“Doing what most of us failed to, Master Aabhas Senapati has turned these pandemic ridden 18 months into a process of figuring out how to burst bubbles, see beyond and contribute to humanity as an asset; telling us to peer past the selfishness and how lending aid to even one may spike into a butterfly effect of positivity. Looking over the repetition of setting one goal after the other, he sheds light on the value of finding a true purpose in life by aligning milestones that lead up to it. Through changing mindsets, preaching the necessity of wiseness over intelligence is how his vision comes close to completion.”
Mind Map of TEDx Talk – https://beyondbubble.org/talk",,,Arman/Karl Singh,,Fall 2021,He/Him,,,,"As a very extroverted and social interaction lving person, the Dream Dao Community involvements ie the learning togethers and community engagements is something I look forward to, and the in real life community gatherings (i.e IRL Regen Events) is the cherry on top, being able to meet and interact and exchange ideas with community members in person. The Explorers Program would be really great exposure, as i would get a hands on working experience in a web3 organisation, and also work intersection of social impact, and my prior skillset in Hardware Tech, Web Dev and Entrepreneurship, also would be great way for me to contribute in work being done in this space while also enabling my financial independence during my gap year. I wish to be able to take some steps in social impact domain, and this experience wuld enable me both in terms of understanding and also in terms of connects and resources to make that change happen. I am sure that being part of Dream Dao I will bea bale to collaborare with more fellow builder and champions in the dream dao community.",,,,,,,,,,

I have also adored cars since I was a kid. My dad used to explain to me about cars, the models and the features of the cars everytime we went to their showroom. This developed my further interest in cars. Entrepreneurship came to me naturally, I always wanted to lead teams and guide people. Perhaps, my dad’s work inspired me. But looking at others lead passionate teams made me more passionate about this particular interest of mine. I have also been an introvert, it has been hard starting conversations but once I get to know my peers, I interact normally with them. Interacting with people hasn’t been tough because I don’t care about if people judge me,because people online have been very supportive. Additionally, I am an enthusiastic, funny and empathetic person. My mom has always taught me to be kind and I started developing empathy towards others, I have helped out at local NGOs too! Besides all this, I am also interested in engineering and have taken science subjects in my senior secondary to hopefully major in computer science engineering in the future.",,,,,Spring 2022,She/Her,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am passionate about all things social impact, I've started Sigueme Voluntariado, an NGO in the poorest slums of Peru, we built 25 houses and 16 staircases. I then started Enseñame and scaled an online platform to bring one-on-one education to children in Peru whose schools closed as they had no resources to provide online classes. It scaled to 3000 kids tutored by 3000 tutors within 5 months and many professional psychologists, teachers ad big companies CSR initiatives such as IBM joined the mission to support our volunteers. My role in both NGOs was in the strategic, coordinating, and executing side to lead the teams.  This summer I interned at Fifty Years, a VC supporting entrepreneurs solving worlds problems (literally if the impact was not the end goal, it was a pass) and currently exploring my next entrepreneurial endeavour. My passion for impact started through helping these communities but I am very excited about health in particular. I am fascinated about optimizing our biology so we no longer have disease through the right nutrition, meditation, syncing our circadian rhythm, fasting, cold exposure, and choosing the actions that are individually right for each person's unique biology. We have stirred away from nature so much and lost touch with our internal biology hence creating disease. I see web3 brings immense opportunity to bring finance to the unbanked, job opportunities with those with less access to education, to use finance as a means to regenerate our environment and to create communities that can pursue passions and create value for the planet while also being rewarded for it. I see web3 as the opportunity to shift away from traditional ineffective nonprofit activity into a radical systemic change through community and redefining processes but still need a community of other builders and mentors in the space to achieve this mission. ","I am really excited to join a group of people who also hs bold views on making a massive impact possible which is often hard to find. I absolutely loved the focus on creating possibilities from scratch. What I mean with this is that the whitepaper highlights how nascent the social impact applications of web3 are hence providing a blank slate for us to imagine the future and create new possibilities, similarly, it highlights how we now have the task of stirring web3 towards massive impact and a systemic change rather than letting it carry a reputation of building more wealth for the wealthy. Both speak to the massive opportunity we find ourselves at to define how the world looks ahead AND you guys manage to tie it back by stating **We are investing in humanity's collective future by investing in those who will build it.** which also alludes to the idea of Dream DAO being the supporter and catalyst for change creating possibilities for GenZ to bring crazy ideas to life. This all gives me chills and I am super excited to be part of it. I am thrilled about how the Explorers program includes training and development not only on the technical aspects of web3 but also personal development and introspection! Super excited to leverage the learnt technical skills to build something on Phase 2 of the program. 

One concrete improvement is placing more focus on the Community Pillar described. I believe there is more potential to highlight the importance of this community similar to how OnDeck has done so. Being part of Dream DAO creates an opportunity for GenZs to surround themselves with others taking a less travelled potentially more risky path, it is where people can get fired up by jamming about topics people around them would not be excited about, unplanned collaborations can become co-founders and just a general sense of being supported by a community that also thinks bold and has a mission to restore humanity. The opportunity to learn from expert leaders is unparalleled but we can also highlight a bit more the power of community with other fellows and alumni. On the following page, a quick point is that the Dream DAO Community Principles seems fairly important and something people will resonate with, I would maybe aim to place it higher this might inspire readers to continue reading the details on participation described later. Maybe a change in the explanation of Proactive vs Retroactive funding as it could be described more clearly and straight to the point. One final thought is that for those who are not as knowledgeable on web3, there could be one paragraph at the beginning explaining why this model as a DAO is better than applying similar concepts within the CU's original community, tools, processes. ","Achieving massive impact has been the driving force of every decision I have made, my efforts are always motivated by the idea that each learning will allow me to become an even better leader for change in the future. Web3 has the massive potential not only for creating economies that drive the regeneration of ecosystems and how we interact with one another but also opens opportunities for massive coordination for positive change. I am super excited for the opportunity to leverage this and move masses or create processes that enable this new future to occur. I also want to be a source of value for other Fellows in the program connecting them to people they might benefit from leading, sharing my deep knowledge on conscious leadership, meditation, inner exploration and how to make sure teams are growing as much personally as the project grows or simply being a brainstorm partner for others on their journey. While I would be thrilled to join as a fellow and have this insanely good learning and implementing experience to drive an impactful project though. If not accepted into the fellowship I would love to chat with the team and jam on how can I bring value and help to bring this vision to reality, I would be more than excited in helping with the DAO operations and scale impact through investing in young people.

I want, in the future, to have helped in the evolution of education. I believe, especially in my country, that education does not open as many doors as it should. Businesses and universities do not stand together on behalf of young students, and our education teaches us more about theories than practices that we use in everyday life in the real, common world. I believe that using web3 will be a way to innovate education, democratize knowledge that companies expect young students to have, share knowledge in politics and the arts (helping society to become less ignorant and more respectful), as well as enable our community to turn democracy into something more direct, in practice, rather than indirect, since we will be helping decentralize information from the huge capitalists companies.","I am in love with the Explorers Program.

My initial intention was to gain some work experience in the foundation and non-profit area as well as help organize workshops that would help students from non-academic backgrounds to find their dream major and navigate the college application process. What I didn’t imagine, though, is how valuable and transformative this whole experience would actually be. Taking a gap year has given me the opportunity to finally immerse myself in everything I’m interested in – ranging from art over philosophy to linguistics, community building and democracy – and to start looking at a bigger picture through drawing new connections between those topics. What drives me is the fascination for interdisciplinary questions. And this is also why the Dream DAO has caught my attention. Combining web3 and social impact means connecting the dots in a different way. It means raising questions and ideas that extend and challenge my thinking and that is exactly what I was looking for in my gap year. While I haven’t really had the chance to learn something about web3 before, I am convinced that web3 paired with social impact purposes has an enormous potential for the future. Civics Unplugged has inspired me to give back to society and I would like to spread this spirit among other young people as well. That’s why I am determined to be on the forefront of this innovative path and help design it, instead of just sitting in the sidelines watching someone else attempting to do so. ","One component of the Dream DAO, which immediately excited me for the entire day after reading, is the Explorer grant. It´s honestly like finding something I didn’t even know I was searching for – maybe because both the topic and the method (giving teens the opportunity to simply explore and learn what they want) are kind of blind spots in my society. Neither of them is being taught or practiced in schools, so I am happy that this gap is soon to be covered by the Dream DAO. 
What I´m still trying to figure out, though, is the membership within that community. I read that quadratic voting is planned to be implemented and I was wondering if this might shift voting power too much away from “regular members” to “frequent contributing members” - even to the point when less involved members are losing their voting power? Will there be members without any voting power at all? If yes, why would we even want that? 
Furthermore, I was wondering if there could be some mechanisms ensuring the growth and accountability among the members (i.e. weekly reflections? monthly supervisions? buddy system? etc...)","I wouldn’t underestimate the value of bringing an international (more precisely a German) perspective to the table. Both my experiences with CU and Global Ciitzen Year Academy (GCYA) have shown me that it can be very enriching to hear from many diverse opinions and I can imagine very well that this is also very important for the further development of the DAO. GCYA has helped me to become a bit more attentive and sensitive to inclusivity issues, which I consider very important for a flourishing community. So, this could be something that I´ll advocate for within this community.  
Another strength of mine is communication, and through being a CU Guide I also had the opportunity to learn how to moderate and facilitate deeper conversations like in the Juntos. In the context of the Dream DAO, I think this could be useful since everything is about interactions and collaboration and being able to articulate one´s ideas clearly is key for progress. 
",,,Spring 2021,she/her/hers,"Especially over the course of the Spring Fellowship I got the chance to regularly chat with Carmen Reisdorf and this has honestly been one of the best parts of the entire fellowship for me. What I really love about our conversations is how Carmen always manages to make me view a certain topic from a new angle. Be it cultural differences or societal trends - her questions have pushed me to think deeper about a topic and articulate my own viewpoint clearly and precisely. 
Other than Carmen, I could imagine Vivien Riener because I know she is working with aspiring social entrepreneurs on a daily basis and I feel like she could be interested in Dream DAO´s mission to use web3 for good. I´m not sure if she would have enough time to contribute to it but I think she might like the idea and maybe has some connections as she is working at the so-called “social innovation lab” in Germany. She was my Guide during the Spring Fellowship and I loved talking and discussing with her because she is super open and tried to help us whenever she could. 
","In case Baratunde Thurston is not already involved in the Dream DAO, I would suggest asking him to join, too. He seems to be a very cool person with a lot of experience in the media and with public speaking, who´s not afraid to ask and discuss a wide range of subjects. Also, I think he partnered with CU in the past anyway.
Also, I would propose Jenk Oz, a young social entrepreneur from the UK, as a potential new partner. He is known for empowering Gen Z as well, which is why he might be interested in joining our Dream DAO and its mission of combining weg3 and social impact. Having founded his media platform at a very young age, he´s managed to gather a pretty big audience in the meantime. So in case of a successful partnership, this wide reach might be beneficial for the Dream DAO as well. Additionally,  I could imagine that his expertise in the field of social media and effectively reaching fellow GenZers is very valuable for further progress of the DAO. Additionally, he could encourage and inspire DAO builders to dig deeper into social entrepreneurship.

The fields of philosophy, psychology and politics pique my interest as they unlock the intricacies of humans. And I also like to dabble in web development, music and poetry composition.
Recently, I have been diving deeper into personality psychology through videos, articles and research papers. To get a better understanding of this field, I am doing an internship with Professor Jaison Manjaly at the Indian institute of Technology, Gandhinagar to assist him with a research project based on Curiosity and Feedback. Through my 6 week internship, I explored the intersection of personality and curiosity. I conducted a survey of more than 150 people where I leveraged existing questionnaires to find and validate a correlation. Through the open sourced IPIP version of the Big Five Aspect Scale by Goldberg and a questionnaire on Epistemic Curiosity by Litman, I found a strong correlation between the two factors.
Through this internship, I am learning to efficiently read and analyze research papers in order to perform a thorough prior literature review. I also learnt to present my findings as research papers, posters and presentations. I will also be presenting my research results to an audience in the college soon.

Crypto exploration through NFTs. I love to make music NFTs - have a look at my collection here https://opensea.io/0x33F56609bfED249E59eE2F6a342ACbb85C300882
At DreamDAO, I want to explore NFTs and their social impact. Being a musician and composer, I find it really frustrating to live in a capitalistic world where the music industry is ruled by big label companies. Through decentralization, the power can be transferred to the musicians who deserve to own their art and appreciation. I am really enthusiastic about revolutionizing the music industry using Web3 technology. This is something I would love to explore to the full extent at DreamDAO",,,,Take Notes for Learning Together #42 (../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Contributions%20Log%2079aa8266fcc44da3bb60c648c01cd522/Dream%20DAO%20Contributions%20Log%2046af1690c22047cb80036ece87901675/Take%20Notes%20for%20Learning%20Together%20#42%20f36b4d82e25f4425877d6f64036afbe6.md),1,,,,,

I am trying to create incentives (grants, fellowships, communities) that get more talented young people working on things that improve the long-term future. I work at the Centre for Effective Altruism, am co-founding an EA version of the Thiel Fellowship for HS students, and love community building (I’m slightly obsessed with making sure the right people meet each other). Came across DAOs while writing a book on digital-first community building, spearheaded CU’s early partnerships with EF, and am pretty interested in crypto’s various governance experiments.","Most excited about: DAO designed such that champions:builders is always 1:1 and equal footing, everything about the explorers program (esp learning/building phases, and individual/collective outcomes), always excited by quadratic voting, retroactive funding of public goods, and dope NFTs :) 

What could be improved: I thought the whitepaper was slightly long, hard to find what I was looking for. Not sure if this is part of onboarding documentation, but having a one-pager of user journey/experience for a Builder and another for a Champion might be helpful.

Currently, I have finished my last year of high school and I am about to study Economics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the highest house of studies in my country, one of the best universities in Latin America, and one of the 100 best universities in the world.
In addition to school, one of my passions is music, I currently know how to play the piano and I'm learning to play the guitar, plus I like to sing and for a few years, I've been part of the choir of a youth orchestra in Mexico.
During these last years, in addition to school and music, I have been part of different organizations and social projects both in Mexico and abroad (Civics Unplugged, Ivy House, Rise for the World, Bécalos), as well as different programs and courses of leadership and social entrepreneurship that I have had the good fortune to take, such as the Civics Unplugged Fellowship given by Civics Unplugged and the Human Leadership Program given by Ivy House.
Honestly, in recent years I have reflected a lot about what matters to me and what interests me in my life and I have come to the conclusion that I love and am passionate about many things, including music and finances, but above all, I am interested in learning and being able to develop my skills to help others, I feel that this is what has defined me as a person, being someone who is always curious to learn new things.",,I just want to thank you in advance for the opportunity to apply to the Dream Dao and I reiterate my enthusiasm and my desire to be part of this organization as a builder in this Season 2,Joshua Cruz,,Spring 2022,He/Him,,,,"I believe that without a doubt I will make the most of the resources and opportunities that are offered to me in the Dream Dao since what has attracted my attention the most is being able to learn through the web3 different scopes of our lives and I feel that through from their learning sessions I will be able to learn new things and I will be able to learn to potentiate and develop my abilities to the fullest. In addition, I believe that thanks to its relationships with other organizations through internships, I could test everything that is taught to me within the Dream Dao and could develop other types of skills in practice.
Finally, I consider that each one of the opportunities and resources offered to me in the Dream Dao will serve to form ties and relationships with other people around the world who know more about web3, its operation, and its development.",,,,,,,,,,

I care about rethinking the broken scientific system, and using web3 as the platform to allow arguably the worlds greatest public good (scientific research) to be a greater benefit to all. I also want to explore ways to move beyond no-utility NFT projects with false promises, and start exploring ways to use NFTs in high impact ways to support areas such as conservation and biodiversity preservation, provision of UBI through ReFi mechanisms and supporting jobs for local communities.
My current work life is primarily as project lead at the web3 project PLANT GANG, where we're building the first herbarium of the metaverse, a scientifically accurate collection of scientific 3D model NFTs from real-world scanned plant specimens, which can be collected, stored and accessed on the blockchain in an immutable way.
This project sits within the emerging and exciting DeSci space, which on a wider scale offers a way to change the broken scientific strucutures of publishing, funding and data control. I am enganged in this space, visiting DeSci conferences and following its latest developments and would love to introduce young and interested minds to this space, which in a time of web3 skepticism, offers an exciting and impactful application of blockchain technology to show the world.

Everyone's questions and ideas are already so inspiring which makes me even more excited to join this season. Through the learning together sessions, I hope delve into deeper conversations that will open my mind to new ideas of the importance of Web3 in creating a better future. They will also be a great way of asking questions in a suitable environment as well as introducing myself to Web3 concepts. From the two I attended already, I was telling my friends all about it and I cannot wait to see what other things I learn. I will be sure to attend as many as I can in order for me to get a broader outlook on Web3.
I read about the Explorer's programme and WOW, it seems to be an incredible way to utilise the knowledge learn and your skills in real world situations. Having had the experience of what the fellowship in spring offered, the opportunities that will come in the DAO seem unreal! Being able to work intensively with an organisation over two months will allow you to grow personally and academically.

Everything is very well organized and very easy to read and access, so I consider that the whitepaper and the design is incredible.","I would contribute everything in my hands, with my abilities and superpowers, from learning to help and research and contribute to this initiative that I think is great and very interesting.",Arman Singh - Karl(he)#2965,,Fall 2021,he/him,"I consider that many people can be part of the Dream DAO, from CU builders like Arath and Julieta!","I have met these people thanks to different networks, programs and platforms.

I work for the MCC MediaLab at NYU and help promote software literacy among creatives, and am the course assistant for a poetic computation class. I want to explore the intersection of web3 and social impact to ensure that the space doesn't get co-opted by those who only see its potential for profit, and because I think that DAOs and decentralized tech can pioneer innovative forms of government that can help tackle some of our world's most pressing challenges.","Things I'm excited about:
- experimenting with a merit-informed voting structure. I think that because of its value-based mission Dream DAO has a lot of potential to make sure that DAO tooling is used in innovative and ethical ways to build a healthy community.
- onboarding more young people + underrepresented groups in the web3 space
Improvements for design:
- More graphics! I think that the explanation of the voting system especially would make a lot more sense to a general audience if it was explained with a diagram or graphic.
- Having a glossary of key web3 terms for beginners","As well as skills in user research / ux that I've demonstrated thus far, I also have skills in digital marketing and content creation, copywriting, and product strategy - I have experience working with startups and a venture capital firm, and have previously consulted with 2 startups on their go-to-market strategy.",,,,she/they,"Anyone from the tech / vc club on campus I'm involved in, NYU SVS (http://nyusvs.org/

@karl_lilimarboly","December 12, 2004",Builder 👷🏾‍♀️,,Yes,".I'm a high school senior from India who is passionate about civic engagement in matters that affect humanity. That might sound generic, but I've been working in influential positions at nine organisations which focus on issues from Art Equity to Racial Justice, which has allowed me to expand what matters to me and develop my own understanding of collaboration, leadership and creativity. I wish to explore the intersection of web3 and social impact for two reasons. First, web3 is an living embodiment of active citizenship, except the citizens are neither limited to a country, nor to certain social background. It allows its users to ACTIVELY and INDEPENDENTLY engage in matters of concern. Since civic engagement is crucial for social impact and that web3 is an epitome of the former, I wish to explore this are a bit more as I, literally, see the light. Second, I am disenchanted by nerve wracking impact of web2 on promoting an attention based economy, consumerism and inherently causing damages to environment far more exponential than web3. I might not be well versed in the details of the latter duo, but I must say that Web2 really displayed an ugly side of capitalism, Web3 just shows a democratic and a liveable side of it, and this is why I choose to explore how Web3 influences Social Impact :)","I am most excited about the DREAM DAO Explorers Program! I love the amount of engagement that is expected from an explorer to fully engage in the programme. The Design of the Roadmap, NFTs, Voting, Grants and Programs are SMART indeed, except there is still a scope for the Builder induction to be SMARTIE, i.e, Inclusive and Equitable of people who have the potential to commit to web3 and social impact. As a CU fall 2021 fellow, I've noticed many of my peers are initially with the thought - ""nah, I'm not a IT person, tech isn't my thing, just bland lines of code"" who would later describe the same virtual space as - ""the best thing that'd ever happen to them"". If we promote the CU builders and make them more mindful of web3 enough to let their curiosity sparkle, that's the best thing that can ever happen to an ever inclusive, equitable, intergenerational DAO. This can be as simple as hosting a bonfire/ office hour/ junto meeting, but would definitely encourage the CU builder community as a whole to take a leap in Web3 together!!","All I can bring at its pinnacle is commitment!

To these ends, I plan to study economics and how it can be bolstered by the use of technology. Throughout my high school years, and especially during the pandemic, I've explored various fields by participating in competitions, conducting research, talking to people and just generally being curious to learn about new things. Currently most of my time outside of studies is dedicated to helping organize one of the largest student run conferences in the world(https://hpair.org/)(We are also planning to have a panel on Web3!). In 2020, I was part of an entrepreneurship bootcamp by TiE(the world's largest non-profit in the entrepreneurship space), post which I collaborated with 5 other students to build an ed-tech and peer-to-peer learning startup called Notefynd. Through this experience I learnt a lot more about what it takes to build a startup, got to interact and learn from various people in the ecosystem(angel investors, a VC, incubators, etc.) and also furthered my interest in education reform. This spring, I joined the International Socioeconomic Laboratory as a research fellow and, with 6 other team members, conducted a study on disparities in access to high quality parks in New York City.
I'm also attending a bootcamp on Effective Altruism and forming my own views about how to contribute to the world positively. I think that having access to the right education can change your life and hence I really care about reforming the education sector and providing students with more relevant and practical knowledge.

I also hope to be a part of the explorers program and implement my learnings in a real world environment to have a positive impact. Finally, if I get the opportunity, I will attend IRL Web3 events in my region and also host Gatherings to learn more from the larger Web3 community and spread the word about Dream DAO.",,,,,,,,,,

I know that might sound weird considering that I’m applying for a position at an organization that’s working with crypto. But that’s exactly why I needed to apply. I want to be the environmental voice of reason in a place where this is much needed. I truly want the Dream DAO and Civics Unplugged to succeed but I don’t want it to lose what it stands for along the way. About a month ago, I had the honor of representing a Swiss Youth NGO at COP26, the United Nations Climate Change Conference. I’ve heard lots of interesting perspectives and opinions from all around the world during my time there but there is one thing I often hear that I don’t agree with. We don’t need to change everything about how our society works, and we don’t need to suppress innovation. We just need to find ways how to do those things in a sustainable way. The same thing goes for web3. Ethereum Mining is extremely carbon-intensive. One NFT has an estimated carbon footprint of a bit more than one month living like the average European. If you want to go down this path, then it needs to be at least carbon neutral. I think that the idea behind the Dream DAO is interesting and worth exploring further. Web3 will continue to grow and gain importance in our society. So, it is up to us to make this transition as environmentally friendly as possible. Outside of my work in the climate scene, I’m advocating for LGBTQ+ rights in schools and I’m currently working on a Civics 2030 Project Proposal with some other Builders.",I'm really excited about the impact the Dream DAO is going to have on people across the world. Giving young people the opportunity and resources to learn about something they're passionate about will be the key to solving social problems. This is a beautifully inspiring mission and I'd love to be part of that. What I would improve about the whitepaper is obviously to talk about the environmental impact of NFTs. This topic should be talked about no matter if it's in a positive or negative way. But I believe that the Dream DAO needs to strive for making it positive.,"As a Dream DAO Builder, I would not only bring my perspective on the Climate issue considering NFTs, but also the motivation to move this mission along. With web3 becoming an extremely important technology, it is beyond important that young people get the resources to explore this new world of opportunities to its fullest.

I really enjoyed the experience and I continue to stay heavily involved as a Builder. Outside of that I am a high school junior and spend my time on schoolwork, my school theater productions, and crocheting winter gear for a school donation club. I am really interested in learning more about web3 and being involved with it's intersection with social impact because I found my way to the DAO after hearing about it in the CU community. The more I learned about it, I slowly became more sure it was something I was interested in plugging into. I got a chance to jam on it and join the discord in early stages because I attended steering meetings that addressed it, which was a great experience. Web3 careers are very interesting to me, and I enjoy reading about the rapidly expanding potential it has. I know there are many directions this could take, and the idea that I could be a part of the founding members who get to help design and develop the way our DAO is structured is so exciting. I am passionate about social impact and I have had a chance to do a lot of personal development and learning through CU, and I am ready to apply my knowledge and experience through contributions to the DAO.","It's super overwhelming to dive into Web3 and try to learn about it on my own as a high schooler. I really love that the builders will have mentorship and access to people of different experience levels to facilitate and support the learning process that will be ongoing for all members, especially builders. As a soon to be senior I am really trying to find ways to discover more of my you shaped hole, try out new things and hear from new people about what sort of things are out there. I see so many ways that I could do this through becoming a DAO member, not only by speaking with champions, but also through committees, the Dream DAO Board, and the Explorer and Accelarator Grants. ","I really enjoy working on things for Civics Unplugged and helping cultivate a supportive and engaging environment for learning and I think that shows in how much time and energy I dedicate to it. I reliably and efficiently work to better myself and the space around me. I would bring that same commitment to the Dream DAO, along with the skills I have learned through my time there. The personal development concepts and especially the communication I have learned through hands-on work with people of different backgrounds and opinions have made me a more empathetic and openminded person. In working alongside all 3 graduated fellowship classes I walked away with a stronger collaborative spirit and the knowledge that I really enjoy the process of learning.

Xe is an incredibly hard worker and seamlessly connects leadership and assertivness with compassion and support of everyone around xyr. Ash has shaped so much of Civics Unplugged and has been a huge reason for my sucess in contributing as well. Working with Ash is always a huge pleasure and xe is an asset in whatever xe commits to. ","I think it would be super cool to involve an NFT artist as an interesting perspective on how to harness the power for our cause. Artists see their work go out into the world and they watch what people do with it, so I'm sure they would have some valuable insight. One artist I like is Kevin Abosch. He makes pretty NFTs and tweets about his experiences using the blockchain as an artistic method.

Someone I found who I really admire in my personal research about the power of NFTs and social change is Drue Kataoka. She brought together 5 women to work on a project called ""Will Your Heart Pass The Test"" after seeing millions of NFT peices incorperate sexist and racist imagery. It serves as a response to the crypto community turning a blind eye to this. They held an auction, similar to what is detailed in the DAO whitepaper, and the proceeds went to The Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta and Stop AAPI Hate.

I care that people get the true benefit of these technologies and not shrug the topics off because of ignorance. Web3 is the best chance we have to put people and the community in charge of their assets and data. It's the most effective way to cut out middlemen and have direct impacts on the betterment of society which the dream DAO envisions to do.,After reading the whitepaper I was most excited about how big of inspiration it will be for other organisations that aspire to cut bureaucracy and want real impact. The best thing that comes out of Dream DAO is explorers program as skill is that matter for making an impact which needs to be imparted to people my age where everyone is overloaded with information in a good way.,I think the main reason for different people is so as to have a diverse set of opinions in the decision making for which I will try my best. I think I might help in setting long-term visions for the DAO and help bridging the gap for others to tech(even though I am not great I might help them learn by becoming accountability buddy).,Gary Sheng - garysheng#5729,madhavgoyal.substack.com,Fall 2021,He/Him,"Arman Singh and Ash Kranti

Growing up in one of the world’s most stunning yet devastatingly unequal countries in the world, my life has been driven by learning, dreaming, and creating a world that is inspired in abundance and equality. I seek to channel the power of culture, world-changing technologies, and human connection to make this dream a reality. Bitcoin has been on my radar since 2013. I began going down the rabbit hole a few years back and throughout the course of the last year, I began to take this budding interest into fostering a much more informed and applicable set of knowledge. Naturally, I took the first step I thought was right, which was to join a crypto startup known as Zash (http://joinzash.com/). Zash is a socially-driven investment platform that seeks to interface social media, investment execution, and community-driven knowledge sharing to provide investors with alpha-led strategies developed by key investment strategists - at Zash, I was leading Community efforts. Aside from doing some trading, I also love exploring new crypto projects that I sincerely feel have real value-add to society. I collaborate and contribute where I can with these communities, and have been a part of some exciting DAO's - including part of the core team at CityDAO (http://citydao.io/), where we are tokenizing land on the blockchain and am also developing an impact-led NFT strategy with CitizenDAO (http://citizendao.com/). As of late, I am spending my time primarily with Cohere (cohere.network) - where we're building out regenerative innovation hubs powered by web3.
I've witnessed first-hand the real harms that centralized power can bring to society - Guatemala's socio-economic landscape is mired in rampant inequality that stems as a consequence of centuries-old discrimination and exclusion. I am deeply passionate about the potential of Web3 to provide a platform and solution to address this existential problem we face. Web3 enables anyone, without barriers to access a better shared world. A world where value is distributed with more consideration to those around us, our vocation is fostered, and our community is nurtured. Web3 promises and delivers on this and so much more. I am incredibly excited about the future of this space and believe that DreamDAO is playing and will play an increasingly important role in fostering innovative ways of deploying Web3 solutions around the world - particularly aimed towards supporting youth. My passion is to be able to onboard more youth from Latin America into the space, with which I would love to explore an opportunity with DreamDAO!",,"I'm super excited by what's being built here. My passions are led by adventure and curiosity and I'd love to be able to explore how we can leverage more IRL interactions throughout DreamDAO.
I am an avid outdoors person with a deep interest in enabling solutions to address environmental degradation. Some of my most inspirational and moving moments have been deep in tropical jungles, on high cliffs, and in valleys. Protecting these ecosystems is incredibly valuable to me, and I feel called through my practice of adventure sports (surfing, rock climbing, scuba) to be an advocate for more harmonious relations with the earth.
My curiosity has led me to continually seek new perspectives on the worlds we all inhabit. With this in mind, I have traveled extensively, spent late nights reading (currently working on: The Four Agreements and The Tao of Physics), found resonance in music - express through song and guitar playing, among other creative endeavours!",Madison and Gary,,,He/Him,,,,"Funding from network, Learning and/or work opportunities, Mentoring youth and their projects","Hyperconnector, Web3 Founder/core contributor, Crypto enthusiast, Philanthropist",,,,,,,,,

Slightly disappointed, but not unmotivated I took initiative by cold emailing around 100 public policy think tanks, giving a short pitch on why they should take a chance on a seemingly crazy high school freshman for an internship. 99 declined, but the President of the California Policy Center appreciated my passion and offered me a legislative internship - the rest is history.It's quite obvious that I am a huge public policy fanatic and nerd, an interest that often defines me and one that I have intricately involved myself with. But my English teacher always told me to show, not tell, so that is what I will do below by sharing some of my past experiences:I serve as a Policy Advocate for the Harvard University School of Public Health and San Jose State University Human Rights Institute for example, where we aim to translate scientific medical research into quantifiable legislative policy. I also am the Organization Director of The Policy Initiatives Institute, a prominent youth-run legislative educational nonprofit organization where I lead a team of 110 passionate high school students in enacting and educating about policy and legislative change. We have had over 40 policy articles published, 9 nationwide policy campaigns held, connected with 15 partners, and reached 50 countries. Additionally, I am also deeply involved in the academic side of public policy, having received a full residential scholarship to UC Santa Barbara for the 2022 summer to reside on campus for a month and conduct academic public policy research. Lastly, I serve on numerous town and district level commissions and boards, including the 18th Congressional District Advisory Board, and have had award-winning public policy writing published on numerous platforms, including the Stanford University Daily.Aside from this, I am also interested in academic scientific research, and how we can lessen the divide between research and the legislation that passes law-making institutions across the world. Lastly, I also deeply enjoy music, playing the piano, guitar, and ukulele, and like to read and exercise in my free time.",,"Feel free to view my LinkedIn below if you would like more knowledge on my past policy/legislative experience and how I can hopefully in the future connect the work I do, with web3: https://www.linkedin.com/in/najman-mahbouba-36585sdfg/",,,Spring 2022,He/Him,,,,"From exclusive opportunities, conferences, a community of knowledgeable web3 fanatics, and an array of other enlightening experiences, Dream DAO offers an immense amount of resources.

I would appreciate the opportunity to be involved in such a thing, and appreciate what is being offered by the DAO.",Oliver yehlik,,Fall 2021,He/Him,,,,"The Learning Together sessions, of which I have only attended two, already seem like a great way to become more educated about things such as real-life applications for solarpunk views and ideas. They also provide a good way to talk with peers about the ideas brought up in the DAO that are hard to find locally.
The Explorers Program offers a way for people like me to actually have a direct involvement in the Web3 space aside from discussion. I would really look into what I can contribute with. Additionally, I have a strong interest in cybersecurity, which I plan to work with professionally, and programming. While I know these skills are not necessarily needed, I am passionate about them and would appreciate any way to be involved regarding them.
The IRL Collaborations are very exciting to even think about. I live in a fairly rural area, so the possibility to talk with people in real life about these digital Web3 ideas is enticing. Additionally, traveling to a place like New York to meet with likeminded and diverse people sounds like it would be an unforgettable experience and help myself be involved deeply.",,,,,,,,,,

I am currently doing a Research Internship at University of Toronto, I was selected for a funded research grant which allowed me to move to Toronto from India (where I live) temporarily. I also love software development. I am fairly new to Blockchain and Web 3 space, and I am trying to learn more about it. I care about making real-world contribution, not just by building something that people can use but by building something that promotes a social cause, enriches lives and will also potentially help the world. That's something that I am genuine about and am working towards. I personally don't think I have had the opportunity to be a part of something like that, but I will surely thrive to be. You could say that the research I am doing will somehow contribute to Academia and can indirectly be used for a good cause, but I'm not satisfied with just that. I wanna do more and I know I am capable of helping more people. At the end of the day, when I look back and see the number of people I helped, no matter how little it was, I'll still be happy and smiling about it and will also want to try harder the next day. Other than that, I love weightlifting, music and reading. I also love to travel and talk to people about their experiences, cause that helps me learn new things. I look at life with the perspective that the other person you are talking to has something to teach you, this is something my dad taught me.",,"I'm 20 years old, I don't know if I am eligible or not for this, but I still think it isn't too late for me to try and apply as this will finally grant me a chance to build something that may have a huge social impact.

The fact that there will be other builders who may be more skilled, smarter and diverse will allow me to learn from them and grow not only as a builder but also as a person. The community seems to be very supportive, friendly and approachable, and that is a place that I want to be in because that's the type of energy that we need to make a social impact. I would also love to be a part of the organizing team that hosts events in real life, and help bring in more regens and encourage them to work on creating something that has a social impact. The learning together sessions seem great, I attended one with Marcus from Cohere a few days back and I absolutely loved it. And I would definitely want more of them because the speakers who come seem to be working on the same cause that we are working on. I believe that if I redeem myself, I will also be given a chance to fly out to a Web 3 conference, that's also something I look forward to as it will help me meet new builders from different backgrounds.",,,,,,,,,,

I am Sam Rad. I don't even know where to start with the story of how my journey intersected with this new way of thinking, living, and collarborating. It was probably long before I got into tech as an entrepeneur. I was always questioning about how we could do things differently, shape a different reality, manifest the future. My background was actually in theater (as a writer, performer, and director) where I created a NYC based theater company for senior citizens 65+ to participate in plays that addressed socially relevant issues. I expanded this to all demographics, and incorporated tech. During that time, I was finishing my undergrad degree in anthropology and wrote my thesis on the virtual world, Second Life. I came across digital assets, bitcoin, and the ideas of decentralization and my mind was blown. I ended up on a PhD track to research virtual economies (in 2011) but started a company and, well, 3 companies in blockchain/web 3/crypto and here I am today. I found that over the years, my super power has been educating about the WHY of web 3 because so many folks would dive deep into the what it is, how it works, without showing WHY we need it. I ended up joining Singularity University in 2017 for blockchain faculty, have continued my research and participation in DAOs, give keynotes around the world, and have written an introductory guide called Bitcoin Pizza: The No-Bullshit Guide to Blockchain. I'm now the CEO of a Web 3 Communication Platform called LOVE, which aims to decentralize and democratize personal communications (and take on the Facebook monopoly!). We believe communication platforms (and the internet) should be a public utility. My super power is being a storyteller and catalyzer. I can equal gravitas stand on a stage as a keynote speaker or behind the stage as a director and empower folks into action. (If I believe in and my values align with the cause). As I have reflected over the years, I've realized that this shift in my consciousness is something that will never change and I will work the rest of my life to advocate, educate, and empower folks to imagine new models of cooperative governance, value creation, and more.",,,Josh and Gary,samantharadocchia.com,,She/Her,"Christopher Schlaeffer, founder of my current company, board member at Amnesty International, previous Android founder -- he could be a great connector on the Champions side.

@epistetechnic
",,Champion 🙌,,No,"Hey! I am currently a student finishing my last year of undergrad in environmental economics and business analytics. I work with python mostly using ML libraries like TensorFlow and Scikit to conduct research that is environmental economics related like doing research for evaluating and designing sustainability initiatives using relational databases. But, in terms of web3 I have been taking those strengths from conducting academic research and started to implement it into running concurrent research for web3 protocols to evaluate different KPIs mostly CSR and ESG related ultimately to build out a framework to properly integrate traditional research and development initiatives with web3. I ultimately want to bridge the gap between scholars outside of the space and practitioners in the space. This intersects with youth empowerment as well because it stresses the importance of education and the relationship educators should have with practicioners.  My biggest strength & probably a weakness too is having the ability to have instant internal motivation even though there might not be an external motivator as well as being able to have enough mobility where I'm able to intuitively find future opportunities with and without using empirical data to predict them. A role I really care about creating for me would be an evironmental tokenomist and/or web3 data scientist position since that's what brought me to the space, but I'm willing to take on any role as I am super eager to learn about anything and everything.",,,garysheng#5729,,,He/Him,"My uncle, Dimal Patel, who is an aeronautics engineer for proctor & gamble and my business analytics professor, Alin Tomioga, who is eager to contribute to this space but is too caught up in traditional academia.","Vitalyk Buterin, because he can provide a great deal of insight to the youth that will ultimately govern the metaverse.","

I think that Dream DAO embodies a certain initiative we all need to take right now where there is a lot of fragmented thoughts about how this ecosystem will turn out and that we need the education to be at the core of how we approach the problem of fragmentation.

I'm a leader in my community through my involvement as PTSA Representative for Student Government, Secretary of UNICEF club, Treasurer of Speech and Debate club, and Campus Workshop Facilitator for Kode With Klossy. Most importantly, I'm a sister, daughter, and friend. I'm a Spring 2021 fellow, Civics 2030 Builder, and a CU Guide. I have contributed to CU by becoming a CU Guide for the Fall 2021 Fellowship and Spring 2022 Fellowship where I will facilitate meetings with a group of fellows every week, by being a regular attendee of Steering Committee meetings to offer feedback/thoughts about XYZ, being active on Slack and Discord with both the fellows and builders, regularly attending events such as treks, democracy discourse, MSOM, spontaneous hangouts, and etc, participating in two opportunities for Unplugged Strategies, used to be a fundraising subcommittee member before it was dissolved, volunteered to help Dariel create fellowship certificates for the Spring 2021 Fellowship and volunteered to answer questions from fellows through a Run the World event, and I'm planning to run for the Steering Committee. I care about the flourishing of humanity by tackling important issues such as climate change, education, and civics. And because I care about the flourishing of humanity, I also deeply care about Civics Unplugged. It's the reason why I show up everyday to do whatever I can help the community thrive. I would like to explore the intersection of web3 and social impact because we're in an era that is similar to the the rise of the internet in the 1980s: If we don't learn how to utilize fundamentals of web3 to create social impact, we'll be going backwards as opposed to creating a better future for humanity. Web3 will people to create unique applications, personalize the internet according to their needs, change human collaboration, and provide more transparency. But the problem is that many people don't know about web3 and how it can be harnessed to create a better future for humanity. I would like to be a part of the web3 revolution and use what I learned to create a capstone project in the social impact space. ","Some of the the things that sound really exciting are getting trained in web3 fundamentals, getting funding to pursue meaningful learning opportunities in web3, hosting events about web3, developing relationships with mentors and companies, and publishing thought leadership work. One area that I think could be improved on is that I think using an application and the advice of the Dream DAO Community would be helpful in getting new Dream DAO Builders in Phase 2 (right now, it states that there is a possibility of an application form, live interview, and recommendations from the Dream DAO community, but having a multi-step process wouldn't be fair for Phase 2 applicants because Phase 1 applicants wouldn't have had to go through as much to become a Dream DAO builder). Another thing that I think should be improved on is better defining the difference between the Dream DAO Builders vs Dream DAO Explorers in the whitepaper. ","One way that I could help the Dream DAO is by running sessions about web3 for phase 2 builders.

I'm passionate about learning, fighting misinformation, wrong dogmas, and solving completely broken urban planning&public transportation/social systems of my country & some other countries. Web3 is something new to me, so I want to understand it and the ways to use it for building a brighter future for humanity. Also, I definitely want to help with increasing the social impact of Dream DAO.","Well, firstly, I've always had a hard time understanding crypto, BUT when I've been reading the Dream DAO whitepapers I managed to get a grasp of the basics and even some insights about where the internet is moving nowadays (web3), what are DAOs, and how they can be used for good (like empowerment of Gen Z leaders). Wow, it made me feel immersed and now I definitely feel more certain to advance further in this field! I think it is an immense opportunity for me, and I look forward to understanding web3 and its social impact better as a Dream DAO Builder and using that knowledge to make change!
In terms of the whitepaper, I think it would be cool if there will be more graphics (charts/diagrams) in certain parts to represent data (like creating a cool roadmap, sort of like with the treasury & funding explanation diagram). It will make the info more comprehensible and visually appealing. Other stuff to consider turning into graphic diagrams/charts are ""Benefits Of Becoming A Dream DAO Member"" and ""How The DAO Will Leverage The Power Of NFTs"".
I believe graphics could also be used to highlight and emphasize the most important bits of information and make them stand out from the mass of text, for instance, the ""By 2030, the Dream DAO will have..."" part.","Firstly, I won a big All-Russian startup competition (""Большая перемена""), becoming fairly popular in Magadan (among the individuals in power as well), so I might hold a couple of events and public speeches, promoting Dream DAO and web3 among the youth (statistically 28% out of ~140k people) and the investors, business owners of my city.
I can also plug in some of the best Russian students from the Competitive College Club, so they can spread the info, join during the next phases or participate in the Dream DAO's programs. It might also be a possible way to partner with EduUSARussia and have potential access to the best Gen Zers of the country.
And, finally, I'm a fast learner, who became really passionate about the Dream DAO, so I'm ready to absorb all the info about web3 and utilize it for helping the community grow, eventually trying to realize my potential to enrich web3 with some up-to-date projects.",Gary Sheng! garysheng#5729,,Fall 2021,He/Him,"Arman Singh

I have also been self-teaching myself how to play the piano and I have been trying my hand at writing competitions.

Since the company's mission is to create a social impact, I will be passionate about the work and I'll use the opportunity to improve my time management, organizational skills, public speaking, and writing. I also enjoy writing and designing, so making learning artifacts would let me express myself. Expressing my creativity is really relaxing and, many times, it's difficult to express yourself when you have to do specific tasks set by someone else.
