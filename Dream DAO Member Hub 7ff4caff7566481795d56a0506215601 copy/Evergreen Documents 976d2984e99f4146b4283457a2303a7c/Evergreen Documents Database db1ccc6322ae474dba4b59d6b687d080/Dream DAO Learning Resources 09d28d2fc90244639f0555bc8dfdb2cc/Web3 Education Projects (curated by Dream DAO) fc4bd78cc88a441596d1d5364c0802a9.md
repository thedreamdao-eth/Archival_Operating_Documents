So as we see Dream DAO as a safe space to build self directed learning within the organisation starting with the intersection of web3 and social impact.

We can start making a small group of people who are in a similar situation of valuing SDL, thus learning and researching more in Web3 x Social impact by searching articles and readings across the internet, so that people can refer them. Also for people who do not wish to go the traditional way of college education to find a way to sustain ourselves. We need to know how we can best articulate things we value and wish to make heard to the public.

How can we structure of learnings, leaving with resources to sustain ourselves.

Benefits-

- Activates the community for discussions etc.
- Makes us understand how web3 can, has and will make an impact in the society
    - We need to note that thereare dark sides to this space, so that we don’t fall into those ourselves and choose to refer the chapters of this very large open book to create social change.
    
    > Web3 is an open book, it is up to us to choose which chapters of it to read, and what lines to implement and etch in our lives
    > 

To curate resources that help-

- sharing identification of Web3 in our respective lives as individuals
    - Reflecting on how can it change our lives and such, because we see Web3 much more than a tech tool. We don’t want to be in a traditional rut and wish to know and break the barriers at work and education by creating / finding our own you shaped holes for lifelong sustenance, action and compassion
- emerging contexts with different areas of social impact
