blah blah blah here are notes!

## Foreward

- “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.” Like Newton, the solarpunk movement stands on the shoulders of giants—giants of science fiction.”
- “ Kim Stanley Robinson, who is currently writing environmental SF, in his novel 2312, sets up a dilemma in which humanity is able to terraform other planets such as Mars and Venus, but is yet unable to heal the wounds done to Earth through climate change.”

## Editors Note

- “Solarpunk emphasizes innovative interaction with both our communities and our environment; socio-environmental thought and creation, rather than merely survival in a decaying world, inspire the solarpunk attitude.”
- “After reading over two hundred submissions from across the world, we have done our best to select the most interesting, inventive work inspired by solarpunk and the changing, growing world around us all. We are happy to see these stories represent a vibrant spectrum of ideas, solutions, and places.”
