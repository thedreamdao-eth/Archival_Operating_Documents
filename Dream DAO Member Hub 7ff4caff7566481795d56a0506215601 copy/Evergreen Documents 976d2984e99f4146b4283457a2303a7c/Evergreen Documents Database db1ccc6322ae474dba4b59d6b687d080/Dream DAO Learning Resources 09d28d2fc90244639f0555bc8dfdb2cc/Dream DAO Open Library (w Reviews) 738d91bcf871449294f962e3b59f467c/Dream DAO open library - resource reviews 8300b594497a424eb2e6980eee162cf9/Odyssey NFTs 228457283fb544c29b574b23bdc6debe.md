Review body (1 or more sentences): This was really useful for those interested in like the economic aspect of NFTs. Like how to buy, sell, mint, etc. Not sure how relevant it is for the Dream DAO though because we donâ€™t really seek to monetize via NFTs whichh seemed like the main point of this section.

However, I did really enjoy the first two pages that dove into what + why which helped me learn about the different types of NFTs that exist and what purpose they can serve!

Otherwise it was more of how-to for the NFT trade.
