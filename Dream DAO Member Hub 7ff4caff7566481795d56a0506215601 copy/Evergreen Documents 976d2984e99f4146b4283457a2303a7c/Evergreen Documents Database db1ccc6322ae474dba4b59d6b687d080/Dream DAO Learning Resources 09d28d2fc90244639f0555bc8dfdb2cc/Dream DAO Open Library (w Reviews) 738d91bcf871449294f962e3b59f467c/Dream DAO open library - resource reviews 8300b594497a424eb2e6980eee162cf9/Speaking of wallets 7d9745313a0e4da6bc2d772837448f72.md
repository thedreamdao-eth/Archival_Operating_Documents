Review body (1 or more sentences): Speaking of wallets, really great podcast that dropped today called Oddlots. Tracy and Joe are two Bloomberg bloggers and podcasters who have been slowly over the last year been going down the web3 rabbit hole (albeit still skeptical which is healthy and a good differentiated take). This episode was with the guy who runs the rainbow wallet and itâ€™s a good discussion
