Resource: Odyssey: Intro to Web3 (../Dream%20DAO%20open%20library%20-%20resource%20list%20efd5b2b41c8847fc86ade78b2cc5b759/Odyssey%20Intro%20to%20Web3%202f56b890c4cb4784a218bda635589f0b.md)
Review body (1 or more sentences): Odyssey’s platform is very clean, precise, and aesthetic. It does a good job at addressing main points in manageable portions. It comes with links (citation-like) at the end if you want to explore any topic deeper!

Odyssey is best as a primer + review/summarizer. I don’t think it’s enough to cover the bulk of Web3, especially if you’re a thorough learner. I found myself independently researching many of the topics separately. Lots of rabbit holes.

But if you’re unlike me, this can easily be read within 2 hours at most!

Intro to Web3 has some helpful tips for investing in crypto/wallet set-up so it’s also great place to understand how to plug-in into the web3 space and not just learn about it!
