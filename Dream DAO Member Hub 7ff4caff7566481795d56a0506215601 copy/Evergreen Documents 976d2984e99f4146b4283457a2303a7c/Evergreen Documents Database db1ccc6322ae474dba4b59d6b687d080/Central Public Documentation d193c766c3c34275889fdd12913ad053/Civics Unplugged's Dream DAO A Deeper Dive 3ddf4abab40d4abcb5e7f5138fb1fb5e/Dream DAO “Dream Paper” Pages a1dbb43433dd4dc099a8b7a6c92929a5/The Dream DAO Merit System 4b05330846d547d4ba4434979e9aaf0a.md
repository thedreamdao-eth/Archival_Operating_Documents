# The Dream DAO Merit System

<aside>
ℹ️ The Dream DAO will implement a Merit Badge system to apportion status/influence in the community to those who have done what the community has agreed are merit-worthy work.

## How the Dream DAO's Merit-System-Informed Voting Structure Might Work

---

There are a few common ways that DAOs distribute voting power.

- One vote per token (heavily favors the token "rich")
- One vote per address (vulnerable to Sybil attacks)
- Quadratic voting based on how many tokens you have (still favors the rich)

**We will implement a voting structure that leverages Quadratic Voting based on members’ Merit Badge collections because it ties voting power to the value the voter provides to the community.**

Let's say in some Season of the DAO, the community decides that they want Merit Badges A, B, and C to exist.

And that they want:

- **Badge A** to be worth 3 voting points
- **Badge B** to be worth 5 voting points
- **Badge C** to be worth 10 voting points (because the community deemed this badge incredibly important)

And let's say that there is a...

- Member 1 who has Badge **A** (totaling 3 voting points)
- Member 2 who has Badges **A** and **B** (totaling 8 voting points)
- Member 3 who has Badges **A**, **B**, and **C** (totaling 18 voting points)

The fact that Member 3 has 18 points means that they have 6 times more voting power than Member 1.

If we don't like that certain highly engaged people in the community have this much outsized influence over the community, the community could decide to implement quadratic voting, where:

- Member 3 has $\sqrt{18}$ (~4.24) voting points
- Member 3 has $\sqrt{3}$ (~1.73) voting points

The community can decide...

- What badges should exist should change
- How many voting points each badge should merit should change

How exactly the process of updating badges will happen is TBD.

**This merit-system-informed voting structure runs counter to the default "more money more power" way that most DAOs (and the world at large) operate.**

And that's a good thing.

### Dream DAO Merit Badges

Merit Badges will be critical to the ability of the Dream DAO to be a sustainably rewarding experience for all members.

The idea of Merit Badges is time-tested. Civic organizations like the Boys Scouts have long used Merit Badges to encourage desirable community behavior.

**The Dream DAO will do the same by rewarding all members of the Civics 2030 Community for their merit-worthy work.**

The objective of having these badges is to keep the community engaged and growing. It should be no mystery how a community member can contribute meaningfully and deepen their involvement in the community, namely gain status and influence. We have learned through 2.5 years of building the Civics Unplugged community that it is critical to design communities that speak to human nature and that a transparent, decentralized merit system is critical to scaling a community.

The community will jointly decide if new types of merit badges should be introduced and if current ones should be retired.

Many of the badges below can have different "levels." The first badge is step one. The tiers help people imagine what bigger contributions could look like. We want to encourage creativity in what contributions could look like.

All of these badges will be awarded in the form of **non-transferrable** **NFTs**. The art associated with these NFTs is TBD. It could be a fun community ritual to co-design / vote on badge art options.

For badges that are associated with a role in the community (e.g. Member, Builder, Champion, Membership Committee Member), badges will be tied to a Season of the DAO—so that the badges can help give serve as access cards to communication channels and documents that are role-specific and time-bound. If someone on the Membership Committee for one Season is not reelected for the next Season, they should not have access to the Membership Committee-only documents or Discord channels.
