Open Design Question
What is the best way to structure the Dream DAO treasury and grant system in a way that is fully 501(c)(3) tax law compliant?
"What are the mechanics of a grant application? How can we make this unique and meritocratic? "
"What specific processes will the Dream DAO have for providing resources, support, and connections to Builders?"
"What does it mean to be an ""active"" member of the Dream DAO? What are the rewards for being an ""active"" member? What happens if someone keeps their SkywalkerZ NFT but does not meet the ""active"" qualification? "
"How does the Dream DAO community interact with the Fellowship alumni community? Do Builders (and non-builders) go through an application process or are they nominated/selected in another way? If it is an application process and some are not accepted, how do you ensure they are still incentivized to be active in the Fellowship alumni community and potentially apply again? "
"How can the Dream DAO experiment with educating both Builders and Champions on Web3/the future of it, not just within the context of project/grantee support? In other words, providing knowledge that is useful for both Champions and Builders?"
" ""Builders"": extraordinarily talented Gen Zers who have proven themselves over an extended period of time,""

what are these young people proving? proven leaders? prove that they are capable of going on a learning journey? proven commitment to flourishing? proven capacity? we need to be specific. "
"How can the DAO application intentionally embrace and celebrate superpowers that aren't seen as valuable in the current world? "
it's not clear what governance will look like in the DAO. What is the role of the governing body? What are timeless high level objectives? By timeless I'm asking - what foundation do we need set and what do they do to maintain once governing system has been set up?
"What is the application process for Champions? What qualities are we looking for? It's important to be rigours and intentional about this process. ""We are focused on champions that can provide certain contributions but don't speak to the qualities/traits that we would want from a champion. We could have all these archetypes but adults who aren't forward-thinking, are too egotistical for public learning, don't like working with kids - the Dream DAO needs to be a space where Builders can thrive. The application for champion needs to be equally rigorous."""
"What intentional program/design choice can we make to ensure that we change the mental model of adults who don't think they can learn from young people? "
How can we cultivate deliberate alignment building? What metrics can we use to determine if we're being effective?
Would the governing body be responsible for helping the community decide what badges/NFTs we create in the future?
For potential champions not familiar with NFT's and crypto—- are SkywalkerZ purchases still tax-deductible donations?
