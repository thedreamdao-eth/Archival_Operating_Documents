# What is the application process for Champions? What qualities are we looking for? It's important to be rigours and intentional about this process. "We are focused on champions that can provide certain contributions but don't speak to the qualities/traits that we would want from a champion. We could have all these archetypes but adults who aren't forward-thinking, are too egotistical for public learning, don't like working with kids - the Dream DAO needs to be a space where Builders can thrive. The application for champion needs to be equally rigorous."
