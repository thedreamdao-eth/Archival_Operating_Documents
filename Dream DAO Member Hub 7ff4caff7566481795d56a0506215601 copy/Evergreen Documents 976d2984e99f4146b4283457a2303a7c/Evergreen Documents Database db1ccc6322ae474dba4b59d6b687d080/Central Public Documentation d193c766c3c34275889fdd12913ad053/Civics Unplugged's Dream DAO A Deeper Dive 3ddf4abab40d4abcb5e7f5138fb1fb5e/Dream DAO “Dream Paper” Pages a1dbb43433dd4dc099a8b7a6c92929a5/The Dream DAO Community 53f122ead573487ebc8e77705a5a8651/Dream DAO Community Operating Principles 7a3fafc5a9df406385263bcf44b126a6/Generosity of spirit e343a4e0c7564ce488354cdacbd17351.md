# Generosity of spirit

Why we chose this principle: When members exhibit the openness and willingness to share their gifts with othersâ€”joyously and willingly and without expectation of receiving anything in return, they create a sense of abundance. Generosity of spirit lays a foundation of trust and reciprocity necessary to build a sustainable community where every member not just gains but wants to contribute.
