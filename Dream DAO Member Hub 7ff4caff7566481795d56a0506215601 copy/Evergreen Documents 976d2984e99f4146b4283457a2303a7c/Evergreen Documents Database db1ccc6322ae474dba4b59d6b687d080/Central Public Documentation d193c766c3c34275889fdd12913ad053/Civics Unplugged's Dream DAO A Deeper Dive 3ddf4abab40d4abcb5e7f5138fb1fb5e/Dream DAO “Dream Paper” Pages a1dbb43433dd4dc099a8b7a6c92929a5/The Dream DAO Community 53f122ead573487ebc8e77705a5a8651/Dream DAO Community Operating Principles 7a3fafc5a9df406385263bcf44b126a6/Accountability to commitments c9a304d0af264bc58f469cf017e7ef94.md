# Accountability to commitments

Why we chose this principle: A community is intrinsically important, but the community must be effective at solving problems. There are goals that need to be accomplished. Progress needs to be made, even if the definition of progress evolves over time. When members motivate each other and hold each other accountable, everyone gets more done.
