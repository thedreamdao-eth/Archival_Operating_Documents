Community Operating Principle,Why we chose this principle
"Democratic grant distribution and decision making ","Strategy and grant funding will be determined by a democratic participatory process led by the community. The goal is to ensure that the DAO is driven and affected by the community as a whole and not a few individuals. "
Community learning and knowledge sharing,"No individual or organization has a monopoly on knowledge and wisdom. Everyone can learn from everyone else, and everyone's efforts can be made more effective through peer learning. The community will be able to achieve so much more if it is able to learn from the collective experiences of its members as they explore different pathways to achieving a shared outcome."
Deliberate alignment building,"Dream DAO members need shared values, mission, vision, goals, information, and operating principles to be effective. This doesn't happen without intentional work to foster alignment between members."
Generosity of spirit,"When members exhibit the openness and willingness to share their gifts with others—joyously and willingly and without expectation of receiving anything in return, they create a sense of abundance. Generosity of spirit lays a foundation of trust and reciprocity necessary to build a sustainable community where every member not just gains but wants to contribute."
Accountability to commitments,"A community is intrinsically important, but the community must be effective at solving problems. There are goals that need to be accomplished. Progress needs to be made, even if the definition of progress evolves over time. When members motivate each other and hold each other accountable, everyone gets more done."
Commitment to adaptation and evolution,"All members must be systems thinkers — recognizing the complexity of the educational ecosystem and the social sector as a whole. We must let learnings emerge, and accept that directions can and will change. And this is for the better. Embracing that inevitability and actively looking to improve the way we do things as a community and as individuals is critical to the ability of the collective to build a brighter future for humanity."
Culture of experimentation,"Accelerants to human flourishing will be discovered thanks to cultures of experimentation. The greatest ideas have come from communities where members are given freedom and encouragement to experiment. By creating the conditions for the larger community of agents to come up with their own courses of action instead of centrally planning all DAO activities, Civics Unplugged empowers its members to spearhead better solutions than what would have otherwise been devised."
