# The Dream DAO Treasury

<aside>
ℹ️ The Dream DAO's Treasury is structured to ensure that all assets are transparently held, and remain tax-deductible and compliant under Civics Unplugged's 501(c)(3) status. This page is meant to set up the foundational structure, which the DAO community will iterate on to best achieve our objectives.

## Overview

---

The DAO Treasury will hold all of the funds raised from the sales (and resale commission) of SkywalkerZ NFTs, along with any other cryptocurrency donations or contributions made to the Dream DAO. Our goal is to create an endowment structure that will allow for long-term and stable development of the DAO, while also ensuring that there are sufficient funds for operation and deployment in a bear market.

The Treasury enables the DAO to:

1. Hold + distribute funding to young leaders across the globe, and;
2. Fuel the growth of the Dream DAO by supporting internal projects, activations, events, and more. 

In order to fulfill these objectives, the assets raised by the DAO must remain under Civics Unplugged's tax-deductible status. Thus, the Dream DAO Treasury is a [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) managed by a committee of 5 persons, who are members of the Civics Unplugged founding team, and a DAO Module that allows the submission of transactions on behalf of the governance token holders. 

**In order to approve or reject a transaction, Gnosis Safe managers must achieve a simple majority (3/5). This is to ensure the security of the funds.**

## Budgeting

---

Each year, Civics Unplugged will submit a budgeting proposal to the community related to the Dream DAO's operating budget. The DAO will also use this proposal to ratify what percentage of the Endowment will be allocated for grants during that fiscal year. 

There will be persistent operating budget areas that will shift in size over time, including:

- Full-time Staff Salaries + Committee Member Stipends
    - Community management
    - Art
    - Engineering
    - Program management (e.g. Explorers Program)
- Events
- Technology

The Operating Budget will become a smaller percentage of the DAO's Treasury as the DAO's Endowment grows.

## The Treasury Committee

---

Our vision is to create a self-sustaining DAO, that doesn't require quarterly fundraising or the constant release of new governance tokens to fuel operations. To do so, we must treat the DAO treasury like an endowment, and manage the funds in a unique way. 

Once the Dream DAO's membership has grown significantly, and most major processes are in place, we plan to establish a treasury committee. This committee will be responsible for suggesting measures that will grow the endowment, while also sufficiently isolating the DAO from outsized risk. This Treasury Committee will be vetted by the Civics Unplugged team and DAO Board and elected by the community at large. 

Using this framework, we hope to achieve the following benchmarks:

**2022: 5 Million Dollar Endowment**

**2023: 15 Million Dollar Endowment**

**2024: 20 Million Dollar Endowment**

In addition to staffing a Treasury Committee, we will likely adopt tools (e.g. [Angel Protocol](https://www.angelprotocol.io/)) that will help us keep our portfolio diversified and automate a lot of the process of growing the endowment.
