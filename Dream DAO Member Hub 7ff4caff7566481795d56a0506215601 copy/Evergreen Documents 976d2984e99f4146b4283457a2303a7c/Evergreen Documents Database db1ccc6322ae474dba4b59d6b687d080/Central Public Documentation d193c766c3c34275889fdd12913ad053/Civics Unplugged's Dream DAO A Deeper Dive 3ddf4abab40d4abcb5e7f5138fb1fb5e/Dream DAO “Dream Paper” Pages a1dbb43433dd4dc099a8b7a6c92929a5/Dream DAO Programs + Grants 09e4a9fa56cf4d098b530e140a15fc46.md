# Dream DAO Programs + Grants

<aside>
‚ÑπÔ∏è **The Big Picture:** The Dream DAO invests directly in talented young leaders who have proven themselves to be committed to the flourishing of their communities and the world, and are interested in leveraging the power of web3 to make change.

# Why We're Funding Young Leaders üí∏

---

The Dream DAO distributes grants to young leaders during the period of their lives when their identity experiences the most development: between the ages of 15-20. What happens during this time period defines the roles they will want to commit to life-long. The goal is to introduce young people to web3 and all its potential now‚Äîso they can steer and cultivate the future of web3.

We want the most talented and capable young people to devote their lives toward addressing impediments to human flourishing, not squandering their potential pursuing an education and career path that is neither fulfilling, stable, nor impactful.

The kind of encouragement and monetary support that young people receive, along with the communities that they participate in during this pivotal stage of their lives has an extraordinary impact on their leadership journeys‚Äîand everything they end up doing in life.

# Types of Dream DAO Grants üí∞

---

The Dream DAO will reward two types of grants, "**Explorer Grants**" and "**Launch Year Grants**". Season 1 of the Dream DAO will focus on the planning of Explorer Grants that will be distributed in Season 2 to: 

- Create a pipeline of Dream DAO Builders who will be better suited for an Launch Year Grant after first receiving an Explorer Grant
- Give the Dream DAO time to experiment with the best way to give out smaller grants

In addition to receiving ETH or local currency, if they are not already part of the Dream DAO community, the grantee will also receive a SkywalkerZ NFT (which is a requirement for retaining membership in the community).

Each of these Grants could be fundraised via a web3-native fundraising platform like Mirror (see example [here](https://madrealities.mirror.xyz/)). Imagine a funder getting an NFT for funding the equivalent of a particular Grant.

### 1. Explorer Grants

Explorer Grants will be given to Dream DAO Builders who are willing to commit to learning the fundamentals of web3 and dive deep into a few areas of independent learning.

Each Grantee will be required to participate in the [Dream DAO Explorers Program](Dream%20DAO%20Programs%20+%20Grants%2009e4a9fa56cf4d098b530e140a15fc46.md), which will equip them with the support they need to begin exploring the web3 x social impact ecosystem.

The ETH will be distributed at various milestones over the course of the program.

**Grant Amount:** $5,000

**Grant Period:** 3 months 

**2022 Budget Allocation for Grant Type:** ~$250,000 (50 grants awarded)

### 2. Launch Year Grants

Starting in Fall 2022, a subset of the graduates of our Explorers program will be offered a larger stipend ($12,000, paid out at $1k/month for a year) as part of a program called Dream DAO Launch Year. This program is intended to enable the most promising and committed Explorers to have the financial freedom to pursue a career in web3 x social impact full-time for a year (and pave the way for far more young people to dive deep into web3 full-time).

**Grant Amount:** $12,000

**Grant Period:** 1 year

**2022 Budget Allocation for Grant Type:** ~$60,000 (5 grants awarded)

# The Dream DAO Explorers Program üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ

---

The Dream DAO Explorers Program (DDEP) is be a two-month internship program for Dream DAO Builders who are looking to explore their interests in web3 and how web3 can be used to address social challenges. The pilot program will select 10-15 Explorers and is slated to run from mid-May to mid-August 2022.

Participants do not have to be very tech-savvy, but must be extremely committed to learning how to harness the power of decentralized systems to make a difference in the world.

***What are the ultimate objectives?***

- Advance web3 x social impact by empowering Dream DAO Builders to contribute to the missions of impactful web3 x social impact organizations
- Explorers contribute to the collective intelligence/knowledge of the Dream DAO, web3, and the world
- Greatly elevate the brand of Dream DAO and the inbound from potential funders and talented Gen Zers
- Help the Dream DAO Explorers advance their skillsets, profiles, and careers in web3

The program is split into two tracks: a guided investigation or partnered internship. However, some deliverables span across both tracks, such as the learning artifacts and capstone project.

### Part 1: Learning Through Experience

**Track 1: Guided Investigation**

- Builders conducting an investigation in web3 technology will...
    - Find (or get connected to) a mentor or organization to conduct research with
    - Establish deliverables for the research project with mentor and DAO committee
    - Schedule periodic syncs with mentor and update DAO committee with progress

**Track 2: Partnered Internship** 

- Explorers conducting an internship at a partner organization will...
    - Join/create a project at a partnered organization
    - Create KPIs with org mentor and DAO committee, ensuring work intent
    - Follow org‚Äôs preferences for syncs and update DAO committee with progress

### Part 2: Share Insights

Once explorers gain sufficient knowledge and takeaways from their experience, they will construct **‚ÄúLearning Artifacts‚Äù** to benefit the community at large. 

- These artifacts can take many forms: an article, learning together session, vlog, video essay, and more.
- One will be created at the midpoint of the program, and another will be completed at the program‚Äôs conclusion.

At the program‚Äôs conclusion, the cohort of explorers will tackle a **capstone project**. 

- These projects can include: an experimental feature, a product, an initiative that pushes the web3 x social impact forward in some way.
- Capstone projects will be created by multiple explorers (possibly the cohort as a whole)

Explorers will also submit feedback on the DDEP to better inform future iterations of the program. 

### Design Intentions:

The **Capstone Project** is important because...

- Explorers will learn best by doing,
- They will likely fail in a few ways which is key to learning,
- It's important to push Explorers to put something out in the world and put in the reps for creating something new. If we want to have a community that will be leading the world in a decade, they need to start putting in the reps of creating and launching something out into the world often! (And fail gracefully).

Throughout the program...

- Each Explorer meets twice a month with a dedicated **Guide** (a Champion) who will serve as an accountability partner and work with them to identify how the Dream DAO community can best support them.
- Each Explorer receives **career development training** and **personal development exercises** that align with their trajectory as an emerging web3 contributor.

This serves to support...

- The leadership development of the grantee (helping them crystallize what they've learned, what they want to do and learn next, and identify what they might need help on)
- The collective intelligence of the Dream DAO community and general public

Program administration: 

- The DDEP will be co-created and run by members of the Dream DAO‚Äôs DAO Learning Working Group, with support from select Dream DAO Champions.

## **How will Explorers be selected?** üëÜ

---

In each Season, there will be a call for Grant applications and nominations.

In Season 1, the grant review process will be overseen by the CU team. Other community members are able to voluntarily help review applications.

- As mentioned in [The Dream DAO Community](The%20Dream%20DAO%20Community%2053f122ead573487ebc8e77705a5a8651.md), by the end of Season 1, a Membership Committee will be formed consisting of DAO members who have demonstrated a commitment to supporting the process of evaluating new members and grantees.

In Season 2 and later, the Membership Committee will manage the grant review process.

We are looking for potential grantees who...

- Have demonstrated an interest in learning about web3
- Want to seriously explore if they would enjoy a career at the intersection of web3 and social impact (non-profit and/or for-profit)
- Show a deep passion for addressing impediments to human flourishing
- Are able to learn using a self-directed approach
- Can commit their summer 2022 to participate in the Explorers Program

## What are the intended outcomes of the Explorers Program? üí≠

---

### Individual Outcomes

Ultimately, each explorer should have a much clearer sense of their "You-Shaped Holes" in the world of web3 and social impact‚Äîor if they are no longer interested in pursuing a career in this space. 

In addition, they should have...

- A much deeper understanding of how to leverage the power of web3 for social impact‚Äîwith an internship experience, tangible projects, and Braindrops to show for it
- Learned a lot about themselves (passions, talents, curiosities, how they think)
- Learned a lot about the world around them‚Äîincluding macro trends and some of the greatest impediments to human flourishing at various scales
- Developed new skills that expand the number of careers they could pursue
- Built a much stronger network that can help them get to the next chapter in their leadership development journey‚Äîwhether that next chapter involves leveraging web3 or not

### Collective Outcomes

While the explorers will gain invaluable knowledge from the program, the Dream DAO community will also benefit from their journeys. 

The collective will...

- Identify who might/might eventually be good candidates for an Launch Year grant
- Learn from the capstone projects that Explorers create (which should be mutually beneficial for the young person and the org they partner with)
- Gain insight on how to improve the next Explorers Program and support more young people who want to the space (the graduating DDEP class will help craft the updated curriculum for the incoming class)
