## **What is the Dream DAO?** ‚ùî

---

The Dream DAO is a new intergenerational, intercontinental, and interdisciplinary community that **invests in the future of the web3 x social impact ecosystem, by providing Gen Zers with the training, funding, and community they need to leverage the power of web3 to secure a brighter future for humanity.**

Founded by 501(c)(3) social enterprise [Civics Unplugged](http://www.civicsunplugged.org), the Dream DAO's Season 0 kicked off in November 2021, alongside the release of the SkywalkerZ NFT collection (See: [SkywalkerZ: The Dream DAO's Flagship NFT Collection](SkywalkerZ%20The%20Dream%20DAO's%20Flagship%20NFT%20Collection%204b82c75dce9045f588a9a2abe0707f8d.md)). Season 1 began on January 8th, 2022 (See: [The Dream DAO Roadmap](The%20Dream%20DAO%20Roadmap%20c912b6dca32640e5ac8e3ca6be2b7581.md)).

By 2030, the **Dream DAO will have...**

1. Directly supported thousands of Gen Z Builders in leveraging and building web3 to accelerate the flourishing of their communities and the world
2. Trained hundreds of people to start social impact DAOs that follow the blueprint of the Dream DAO
3. Inspired over a million more Gen Zers outside of the DAO to explore and potentially work in the web3 x social impact space
4. Helped define a vision for and supercharged the development of the web3 x social impact ecosystem at large
5. Aided the development of a sustainable web3 learning community and DAO structure

## **Who powers the Dream DAO?** üí™

---

The DAO is powered by a diverse, intergenerational community‚Äîwith members spread all across the globe‚Äîunited by the belief that investing in Gen Z leaders to leverage the power of web3 is key to addressing some of humanity's greatest challenges.

The community consists of...

- The **"Builders":** talented Gen Zers (15-20 years old when they join the DAO), who have proven themselves as leaders, and are interested in exploring how to leverage the power of web3 to build a brighter future for humanity and the world.
- The **"Champions"**: established leaders representing a range of industries who seed the Dream DAO with SkywalkerZ NFT purchases and direct donations to the DAO treasury, and lend their expertise, networks, and other resources to the mission of Dream DAO.

### Founding Members

The vast majority of the founding (onboarded before Phase 1 of the Dream DAO) Builders of the DAO have been participants of the Civics Unplugged Founding Fellowship program. Successive years of the CU Fellowship will likely be the greatest source of Dream DAO Builders. CU Fellowship alumni have been trained in systems thinking and exposed to the importance of human flourishing, and share a commitment to developing themselves into people who can steer the future. 

They represent all 50 U.S. States, as well as 47 countries spanning North and South America, Africa, Asia, and Europe. 74% identify as women and 70% identify as BIPOC.

All the founding Champions of the DAO were invited to apply by the CU team.

## How does the Dream DAO grow its endowment?üìà

---

To join the Dream DAO community, one must purchase a [SkywalkerZ NFT](https://www.notion.so/2c3310dcbcb943b69883079040aa6d19?pvs=21), which will act as the community's governance token. Proceeds from the NFT's sale, along with direct donations, will be held in the DAO's treasury to be allocated by members of the Dream DAO.

As the community grows, a "Treasury Committee" will be elected to manage the DAO's funds, and strategically invest to grow the endowment. As this pool grows, so will the number of kids the Dream DAO can fund on a yearly basis.
