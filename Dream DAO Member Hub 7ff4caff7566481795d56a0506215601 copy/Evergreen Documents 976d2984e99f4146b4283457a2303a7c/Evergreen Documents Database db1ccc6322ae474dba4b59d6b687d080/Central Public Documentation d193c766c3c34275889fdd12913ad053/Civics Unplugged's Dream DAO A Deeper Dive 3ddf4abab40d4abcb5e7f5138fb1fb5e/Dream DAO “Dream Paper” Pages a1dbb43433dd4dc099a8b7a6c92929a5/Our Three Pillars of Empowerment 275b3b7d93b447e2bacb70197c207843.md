### Pillar 1: We Will Provide Funding

---

At Civics Unplugged, we are constantly reminded about how much of a difference our investments make in the lives of young leaders**.** One of the earliest members in our community, Chabu, was able to stop working at Starbucks once Civics Unplugged invested in her at the age of 18. The additional time that she was able to dedicate to contributing to CU eventually landed her a full-time job on the CU team as our Director of Strategic Partnerships. Now, she has developed the necessary skills to facilitate partnerships with National Geographic, Acumen, Teach for America, and more (which would have been difficult to cultivate while making lattes). And with the time and support that her full-time role has afforded her, she has had the time to set her sights beyond conventional civic careers and is excited to help build out the Dream DAO.  Being able to focus in on important topics related to the future made that possible.

> *"Funding for high schoolers is so much bigger than removing financial barriers. Funding gives young people permission to fail (addressing the scarcity mental model that's so hard to evolve from), resources to focus on one's passions and curiosities, and the safety net they need to pursue uncharted paths. Access to funding heavily shapes what young people are able to pursue. If you want to talk equity, capitalism, intergenerational wealth, BIPOC opportunities, we have essentially solved for them through the Dream DAO model."*

We're proud that we've been able to showcase how investing in young people can supercharge their leadership trajectories.

In launching the Dream DAO, Civics Unplugged is ready to double down on this strategy, with a focus on investing in Gen Z civic innovators interested in leveraging web3 technologies.

**We are investing in humanity's collective future by investing in those who will build it.** 

### Pillar 2: We Will Provide Training

Crypto and blockchains are some of the most promising technologies to emerge in the current millennium. Paired with these technical capabilities is the influx of cultural attention, funding, and resources being poured into the space. The possibilities and use cases are endless (e.g. banking the unbanked, helping movements coordinate, ensuring fairness and transparency in marketplaces), but from the very get-go crypto has had an underlying issue.

The barrier of entry is quite high for non-technical people. Learning how wallets, exchanges, tokens, and various different solutions work can be overwhelming and overly time-consuming without guidance. For the last few years, making crypto accessible and easy to use has been the most critical task of any project from this space.

While progress has been made in building onramps for technical people, it is still very hard for a non-technical person—especially a young person who may doubt they "belong" in a space like this—to understand and leverage the power of decentralized technology. 

To add to that challenge of getting a basic grip of fundamental web3 concepts and the programming languages, it's even harder to understand how to apply web3 to practical social problems, given that the web3 x social impact ecosystem is so nascent. (Which also means there is a TON of emerging opportunities.) 

To address these above gaps in education for young web3-curious changemakers, the Dream DAO community will host workshops as well as a flagship "[Dream DAO Explorers Program](Dream%20DAO%20Programs%20+%20Grants%2009e4a9fa56cf4d098b530e140a15fc46.md)" to empower enable Gen Zers to gain the knowledge and opportunities necessary to leverage the power of web3 to change the world.

### Pillar 3: We Will Provide Community

While young leaders in the Civics Unplugged community (and beyond) often find ways to get connected with one another, few have the ability to connect and collaborate with the well-resourced and insightful individuals donating, fundraising, and rallying on their behalf. There's so much that these young people can learn from these established supporters, and vice versa.

CU has an extensive global network of people that would love to invest in and support our kids if brought into our work in a meaningful way that keeps them engaged. And there are thousands of other wealthy, influential, and skilled individuals in web3 who would love to support Gen Zers in leveraging the power of web3 to change the world.

The Champions in Dream DAO are not only experts in their respective fields, but they are all excited about the future of web3. From the community Learning Together sessions to a community of web3 learners, they can grow their knowledge in this space as well.

The Dream DAO brings our Gen Z community and network of Champions of Gen Z together.

**What could the world's most talented and capable young builders and the world's most experienced leaders and thinkers accomplish if they merged their unique superpowers?**

We can't wait to find out.
