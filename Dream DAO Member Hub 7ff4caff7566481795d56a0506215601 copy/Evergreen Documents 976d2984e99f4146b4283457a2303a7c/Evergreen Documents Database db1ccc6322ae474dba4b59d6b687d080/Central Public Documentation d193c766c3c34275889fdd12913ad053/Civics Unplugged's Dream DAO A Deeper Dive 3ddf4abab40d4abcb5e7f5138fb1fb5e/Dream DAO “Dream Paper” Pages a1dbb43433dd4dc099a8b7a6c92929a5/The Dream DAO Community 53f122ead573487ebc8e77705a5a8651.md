## The Two Kinds Of Dream DAO Voting Members üë§

---

There are two broad pathways to membership with voting power in the Dream DAO community:

- The **"Builders":** talented Gen Zers (15-20 years old when they join the DAO), who have proven themselves as leaders, and are interested in exploring how to leverage the power of web3 to build a brighter future for humanity and the world.
- The **"Champions"**: established leaders representing a range of industries who seed the Dream DAO with SkywalkerZ NFT purchases and direct donations to the DAO treasury, and lend their expertise, networks, and other resources to the mission of Dream DAO.

       See [Types of Dream DAO Champions](The%20Dream%20DAO%20Community%2053f122ead573487ebc8e77705a5a8651.md) below.

## Benefits Of Becoming A Dream DAO Member üëç

---

### Benefits Of Becoming A Champion

The benefits of becoming a Champion extend beyond the ability to vote on grant recipients and knowing you are supporting a good cause.

They include (but are not limited to) the abilities to...

- Gain direct access to emerging talent around the world
- Connect with high profile Champions that might be great advisors or business partners
- Stay plugged into and lead the conversation about the intersection of web3 and social impact
- Be a part of and co-build a movement that will revolutionize philanthropy, youth empowerment, and web3

For corporations, this is a tremendous CSR opportunity. Not only can they claim that they directly investment a ton of money into young leaders, they can also say they are collaborating directly with them.

### Benefits Of Becoming A Builder

The Dream DAO community will improve the lives of Builders in many ways, by helping them...

- Gain an equal footing as the amazing Champions (same voting power)
- Gain deep exposure to the web3 world, with a valuable asset that will appreciate as the DAO achieves more
- Stay plugged into and lead the conversation about the intersection of web3 and social impact
- Develop relationships with mentors, companies that are leaders in their field, and other amazing builders
- Gain access to internships/job opportunities in the web3 space
- Be eligible for [airdrops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airdrop_(cryptocurrency)) (aka tokens just from being a Builder)
- Be a part of and co-build a movement that will revolutionize philanthropy, youth empowerment, and web3

## The paths to becoming A Dream DAO Voting Member ‚úçÔ∏è

---

In order to join the Dream DAO, every prospective member must hold a SkywalkerZ NFT, and submit an application that outlines why they'd like to join the community, and what superpowers they can bring to help the DAO achieve its mission. In the future, we may propose a multi-step "fit evaluation" process‚Äîwith first a written interest form submission and then a live interview. It's easiest to get a pulse on who someone is and what they care about through dialogue.

### 0. A note about non-voting members

In order to understand what a Dream DAO voting member is, it's important to compare the archetype, role, and benefits of voting members in comparison to other kinds of Dream DAO supporters:

|  | Archetype | Role in DAO's success | Access/benefits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Non-member | Someone who follows Dream DAO on Twitter, but hasn't donated/bought a SkywalkerZ | They might engage with us on social media, and tell their friends about the DAO | Public channels on Discord |
| Non-voting member | ‚Üí 20+ years old
‚Üí Excited about Dream DAO mission enough to buy a SkywalkerZ
‚Üí Doesn't have time to be a voting member or wasn't selected to become a voting member for Season 1 | They might engage with us on social media, tell their friends about the DAO, make introductions, and so on. But they don't have the responsibility to do so. | ‚Üí SkywalkerZ holder-only (member-only) channels on Discord, but not the voting member-only channels
‚Üí Access to most Dream DAO events
‚Üí Can still weigh in on decisions, they just won't have a vote |
| Voting member
(DreamerZ) | Excited about Dream DAO mission enough to buy a SkywalkerZ and devote 1-2 hours a week to the Dream DAO (either as a Builder or Champion).

### 1a. Becoming a Builder as a Fellow üß†

---

In Season 1 of the Dream DAO, the Civics Unplugged team picked around 40 promising young innovators to invite to join as Founding Builders of the DAO. Most Founding Builders were discovered through the CU Fellowship, but a minority were invited because of their contribution to social impact outside of the CU Fellowship. There are over 1,000 Fellowship alumni who represent all 50 U.S. States, as well as 47 countries spanning North and South America, Africa, Asia, and Europe. 74% identify as women and 70% identify as BIPOC.

The CU team will prioritize sending invites to Fellowship alumni who have contributed most to the CU Fellowship alumni community.

When invites are sent out, the CU team will be explicit about what contributions made them eligible for the invite. It's important for us to have a ledger documenting who gets picked and, more importantly, why they were poicked.

Beginning in Season 2, Builders will be selected by the Dream DAO community members (likely by a Membership Committee).

Fellowship alumni who are invited to be Builders are given a SkywalkerZ NFT so they can officially join the Dream DAO community.

Learn more about the CU Fellowship [here](https://www.notion.so/The-CU-Civic-Innovators-Fellowship-A-Deeper-Dive-da0ee7cdee7942f59233ec291be7a6cb?pvs=21).

### 1b. Becoming a Builder as a non-Fellow üí´

---

Gen Zers who didn't complete the CU Fellowship but are interested in joining the Dream DAO can only do so by receiving a grant from the Dream DAO.

The community must agree that this person is *unusually exceptional* (and is thus eligible for a grant).

This will happen very rarely. Most members will have joined after participating in the CU Fellowship.

The grant-making process is described in [Dream DAO Programs + Grants](Dream%20DAO%20Programs%20+%20Grants%2009e4a9fa56cf4d098b530e140a15fc46.md).

### 2. Becoming a Champion üí•

---

You must have purchased a SkywalkerZ NFT (see: [SkywalkerZ: The Dream DAO's Flagship NFT Collection](SkywalkerZ%20The%20Dream%20DAO's%20Flagship%20NFT%20Collection%204b82c75dce9045f588a9a2abe0707f8d.md)) to apply to become a Champion of the Dream DAO community.

In Season 1 of the Dream DAO, the Civics Unplugged team will hand-pick a subset of SkywalkerZ NFT buyers to invite to join as Founding Champions of the DAO (~two dozen). These Founding Champions will be selected based on their ability to contribute to laying a strong foundation for the DAO in Season 1. We are looking for people of a wide variety of "Civic Superpowers" to serve as Champions.

Beginning in Season 2, Champions will be selected by the Dream DAO community members.

## Dream DAO Governance üìú

---

The Dream DAO governance structure‚Äîwhich will evolve over time‚Äîwill serve many timeless functions, including but not limited to:

- Approving new members
- Creating/modifying working groups as needed
- Approving grant requests
- Proposing governance changes
- Making strategic decisions that drive the Dream DAO forward

In Season 1, governance of the Dream DAO will be shared by the Civics Unplugged team and the Season 1 members. Governance will be progressively decentralized away from the Civics Unplugged team over time.

It's important that the CU team is able to iterate rapidly and bring in trusted people to help set a foundational culture for the Dream DAO. We don't want to make the mistake many DAOs make of decentralizing too quickly.

In Season 1...

- The Civics Unplugged team will manage the membership process and the grant-making process
- The rest of the community will help review membership interest forms, review grant proposals, and nominate new members
- Each member will have one vote to cast on proposals

By the end of Season 1...

- The Civics Unplugged team will form the **Dream DAO Steering Committee**‚Äîconsisting of a mix of CU team members and Dream DAO community members (a mix of Builders and Champions) who have demonstrated their commitment to contribute (size TBD). The Steering Committee will focus on strategy and leading the process of iterating the DAO's structure to increasingly effectively execute its mission and objectives. (The details of how this Steering Committee will operate will be decided during Season 1.)
- A **Membership Committee** will be formed by election‚Äîwhich will be responsible for evaluating member interest forms and onboarding new members. It's important that people are only selected for this and other committees that form if they have proven they have the time and passion for contributing to the Dream DAO. A diversity of experience and perspective must be represented on this committee.

In Season 2...

- All Dream DAO members will have the opportunity to vote on grant proposals. Voting will likely happen in batches once a month. The outcome of the votes will directly lead to money being transferred from the DAO's treasury.
- If the [The Dream DAO Merit System](The%20Dream%20DAO%20Merit%20System%204b05330846d547d4ba4434979e9aaf0a.md) is implemented, voting members will have voting power proportional to their merit-worthy contributions in the community (where "contributions" don't just mean donations). However, every voting member will have minimum amount of voting power no matter their level of contribution.

## Types of Dream DAO "**Champions**" üî¢

<aside>
‚ÑπÔ∏è We are looking for people of a wide variety of "Civic Superpowers" to serve as Champions.

</aside>

Types of Dream DAO Champions will include (but are not limited to) social entrepreneurs; subject matter experts; business leaders and philanthropists; elected officials and civil servants; influencers, celebrities, broadcasters, and podcasters; civic technologists / hackers / web3 experts; game developers; and leaders of sponsorship-offering corporations, including firms that can donate money tech subscriptions.

They must all be excited to work with and support young people. And importantly, they must respect and vibe well with the Builders in the community. The Dream DAO will benefit Champions in many ways, but ultimately, the Dream DAO is for Builders.

Champions might...

- Mentor and provide opportunities to Builders;
- Host educational workshops with the Builders
- Support with curriculum development and evangelizing
- Fund Dream DAO activities
- Mentor and provide opportunities to Builders
- Lend their platform to Builders
- Mentor Builders and help them and the Dream DAO use powerful tech tools
- Help build incentive systems that keep Dream DAO members engaged
- Sponsor Builders with money and free tools
- And so much more! The possibilities are endless
