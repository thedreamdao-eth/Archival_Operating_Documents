üí° **Ownership of a SkywalkerZ NFT is required to apply to be a voting member of the Dream DAO.**

Once someone purchases a SkywalkerZ, they can apply to join the community. Donors can still opt to just support the fund itself, without participating in its allocation. Additionally, donors who are interested in investing in the DAO, but not holding a SkywalkerZ NFT, can do so by contacting the CU Team directly at [dao@civicsunplugged.org](mailto:dao@civicsunplugged.org).

SkywalkerZ is a collection of 4,060 astronauts building the future of web3 x social impact.

The aesthetic was designed to capture the youthful energy and soaring aspirations of the Civics Unplugged community, and remind everyone that the sky is the ***baseline*** of what can be achieved if we empower Gen Z to build the future of the web3 x social impact ecosystem.

There are a total of 2,030 SkywalkerZ mintable from SkywalkerZ minting site, and 2,030 that will be given to Gen Z civic leaders. The community chose the number 2,030 as a nod to the UN's 2030 Sustainability Goals.

**There are [260](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/255_(number)) in the *genesis batch* of the collection.**

Each SkywalkerZ NFT are sold for 0.1 ETH. The contracts are standard ERC-721 compatible with any Ethereum-based NFT exchange.

Each SkywalkerZ NFT is unique and assembled from 100+ possible traits of different rarities. Almost every NFT is randomly assembled, but there are some pre-designed 1:1 "Legendary SkywalkerZ" scattered throughout the collection as well! Legendary SkywalkerZ are the rarest NFTs in the collection.

## SkywalkerZ and the Dream DAO üí≠

---

- All SkywalkerZ NFT holders can apply for Dream DAO membership, but owning an NFT does not mean you are automatically accepted into the DAO. As we explain in [The Dream DAO Community](The%20Dream%20DAO%20Community%2053f122ead573487ebc8e77705a5a8651.md), we are choosing to be very careful about who we invite to lay the foundation for the future of the Dream DAO.
- For every SkywalkerZ NFT purchased, one SkywalkerZ NFT is reserved to be given to an active member of CU‚Äôs existing Gen Z community that has been invited to join the Dream DAO as a member.
- A SkywalkerZ NFT is required to be a member in the Dream DAO community. We are reserving these NFTs for Gen Zers to maintain an intergenerational balance of decision-making power in the Dream DAO, create a common thread across all members, and ensure Gen Zers are able to own a valuable asset.
- The funds raised from NFT purchases‚Äîwith exception to a percentage that will go to supporting Civics Unplugged's general operations‚Äîwill be managed by the Dream DAO, which is collectively governed by SkywalkerZ NFT holders who have been invited to join the community. Members of the Dream DAO will be able to collectively decide who they want to award grants to (as explained in detail in [Dream DAO Programs + Grants](Dream%20DAO%20Programs%20+%20Grants%2009e4a9fa56cf4d098b530e140a15fc46.md)).
- If a SkywalkerZ NFT holder becomes a member of the Dream DAO, the number of additional SkywalkerZ NFTs they hold does not affect their membership or voting power. However, if a Dream DAO member sells their SkywalkerZ NFT, they will lose their membership in the community and will have to buy another SkywalkerZ NFT to regain it.
