## Snippets from the Dream DAO üëÄ

**This is what a Learning Together session looks like:**

**Aya Miyaguchi** (Executive director of the Ethereum Foundation) joined the Dream DAO for ***Learning Together #28: Ethereum as an Infinite Garden | Discovering Your ‚ÄòWhy‚Äô**.*  
It was a great session; we discussed the process of discovering our visions and purposes.

**Dream DAO Explorers Program:**

The kickoff call for our summer 2022 internship program!

**Builders‚Äô Statements:** 

> *As an intern at [Protein](https://twitter.com/protein), I worked primarily in their Good Growth and Funding teams. They gave me a plethora of projects to choose from, but I thought I could learn the most by working on communications and fundraising. By the end of the internship, I had created pitch decks for sponsorships, edited Good Growth materials, and written small pieces of content. The experience taught me a lot about maintaining team organization and morale in remote environments.*

> *I interned at [Celo](https://celo.org/)‚Äôs [Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/) as a ReFi Analyst. CC is working on a web3 x climate map and I was responsible for researching, outreaching, and summarizing information about different ReFi projects that was/could be at the map. I improved my communication skills and my ability to research about different organizations. I learned more about ReFi and discovered new projects building at the intersection of web3 and social impact.*
