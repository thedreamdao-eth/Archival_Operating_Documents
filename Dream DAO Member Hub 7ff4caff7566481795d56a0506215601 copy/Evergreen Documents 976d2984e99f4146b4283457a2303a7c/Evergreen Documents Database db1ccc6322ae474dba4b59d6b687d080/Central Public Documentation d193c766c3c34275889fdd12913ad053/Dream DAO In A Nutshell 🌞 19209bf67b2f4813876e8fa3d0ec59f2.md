## OVERVIEW

**Powered by¬†[Civics Unplugged](https://www.civicsunplugged.org/), the [Dream DAO](https://dreamdao.xyz/) is a DAO ([decentralized autonomous organization](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o)) that invests in the future of the web3 x social impact ecosystem by providing diverse Gen Zers around the globe with the training, funding, mentorship, and opportunities they need to leverage the power of web3 to build a brighter future for humanity.**

We do this primarily by...

1. fostering an intergenerational learning community for 15-20 year olds seeking to be and build the future of web3 x social impact; and
2. placing our most committed young community members in meaningful paid internships at socially impactful web3 organizations where they can receive mentorship and gain confidence as contributors to the web3 x social impact space;

The Dream DAO community consists of...

- The **"Builders":** talented Gen Zers (15-20 years old when they join the DAO), who have proven themselves as leaders, and are interested in exploring how to leverage the power of web3 to build a brighter future for humanity and the world.
- The **"Champions"**: established leaders representing a range of industries who seed the Dream DAO with SkywalkerZ NFT purchases and direct donations to the DAO treasury, and lend their expertise, networks, and other resources to the mission of Dream DAO.

Current DAO contributors include leaders of¬†[Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/),¬†[Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/),¬†[Yield Guild Games](https://yieldguild.io/),¬†[Friends with Benefits](https://www.fwb.help/), [Angel Protocol](http://angelprotocol.io),¬†[Coinbase Ventures](https://ventures.coinbase.com/),¬†[X Development](https://x.company/),¬†[Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), and more.

**Our ultimate social goal is a future where:**

- Communities everywhere have benefited from capable builders who used their web3 skills to regenerate communities and the planet
- Virtually any young person, anywhere in the world can access education that helps them develop socially impactful web3 skills

**By 2030, Dream DAO will have:**

1. Directly supported multiple thousands of Gen Z Builders in leveraging and building web3 to accelerate the flourishing of their communities and the world
2. Trained hundreds of people to start social impact DAOs that follow the blueprint of the Dream DAO
3. Inspired over a million more Gen Zers outside of the DAO to explore and potentially work in the web3 x social impact space
4. Helped define a vision for and supercharged the development of the web3 x social impact ecosystem at large

## **THEORY OF CHANGE**

How will we achieve this vision of a future full of web3-powered social impact?

We are helping build the web3 x social impact ecosystem by investing in three complementary areas of focus:

1. **EMPOWERING LEARNING COMMUNITY:** The Dream DAO cultivates an empowering, intergenerational, global community and offers a range of learning + mentorship opportunities that help young people gain confidence and experience at the intersection of web3 x social impact. The core ‚Äúproduct‚Äù of the learning community is the ‚ÄúLearning Together‚Äù series, which is hosted twice a week and features a community member or guest hosting a lecture on a web3 concept and spreading the word on the Solarpunk future we envision will come with web3 x social impact. Past guest hosts have included Gitcoin founder [Kevin Owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki), Ethereum Foundation Executive Director [Aya Miyaguchi](https://twitter.com/), renown web3 educator [Samina](https://twitter.com/saminacodes), co-founder of Constitution DAO [Graham Novak](https://twitter.com/gnovak_) and many more web3 luminaries.

2. **WEB3 X SOCIAL IMPACT INTERNSHIP PROGRAM:** A two-month internship program called the Dream DAO Explorers Program‚Äîfor 15-20 year olds seeking to be and build the future of web3 x social impact. For the pilot program starting mid-June 2022, Dream DAO Builders will be placed in web3 organizations making social impact (e.g. Gitcoin, ReFi DAO, Toucan Protocol), and will produce one knowledge artifact a month. Learn more about the program [here](../../../Design%20Documents%20&%20Braindumps%2096c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae/Dream%20DAO%20Explorers%20Program%20-%20Design%20Doc%20(May%202022%20057b51e4dc864f68bf9fe93bf1464d2f.md).
3. **IRL REGEN WEB3 GATHERINGS:** We convene diverse, inspiring, regen-minded thinkers and builders in a way that forges relationships and collaborations across the ‚Äúregen web3‚Äù field/movement (and builds excitement for the idea of hiring more regen Gen Zers‚Äîwho co-organize the events‚Äîto impactful web3 projects). In-person convenings can fill attendees with inspiration. This is why Dream DAO pays for some of our community members to travel to, co-organize, and operate these events.
