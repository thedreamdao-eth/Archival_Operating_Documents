Season: 1️⃣

<aside>
🌿 Welcome to the second issue of the Dream DAO’s Dream Journal. In the Dream DAO Discord Server, the conversation never dies. So two Builders — Charlotte and Jae-Hee — are taking on the task of summarizing events biweekly in a clear and concise manner.  **We are always looking for ways to improve, so if you have any ideas regarding the Dream Journal, contact us through Discord!** In the meantime, take a look around...be our guest! We are so happy to see you here!

# Highlights of the Past Two Weeks ✨

### Learning Together #3: Mapping the Web3 x Social Impact Ecosystem 🗺️

On Saturday, January 22, Dream DAO Builder Ale Borda lectured on and discussed the web3 x social impact ecosystem.  Borda divided web3 groups into three different categories: enablers, who develop systems; conveners, who bring people together; and pioneers, who apply the systems for change.  Notes from the session can be found **[here](../../Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20#3%20395f19ec6f1243688cc231db0baa78cd.md)**, and a Twitter recap thread is available **[here](https://twitter.com/DreamDAO_/status/1485053820430426115?s=20&t=R8mrSVETgEZah6vGuTO3sQ)**.

### Learning Together #5: What are L2s? Which One Should the Dream DAO Use?

Under the guidance of Dream DAO Champion QZ ((QZ#6600), Builders and community members worked together to craft a Saturday Learning Together presentation on L2s.  It was a fantastic presentation; those that attended had the opportunity to explore L2s themselves.  The lecture material and notes can be found [here!](../../Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20#5%20All%20About%20Layer%202s%202b307e1809a543bbab9e3c3a238e6acb.md)

# Working Group Recap 👷

Dream DAO Working Groups have launched!!  Our Builders did a great job setting up meetings with very little guidance. Interim coordinators shared tips to make other groups more successful, and the meetings improved as we all got comfortable.

### One-Off Tasks

The Dream DAO’s One-Off Tasks group is less structured than the others.  The Builders involved take on important projects whenever possible to keep the community running smoothly.  Although there will be no meetings for this group, they are vital to the DAO’s function.  Shoutout to them!

# How to Train a ~~Dragon~~ DAO 🐲

🌱 We are trying to navigate how to operate a DAO with little-to-no guidance, essentially building while flying.  Inspired by Champion **Jason McCutchan** (LMR#5579) and Builder **Madison Adams** (Madison#9398) this section will continuously capture things we’ve tried in the DAO, things that have changed, and the whys/lessons learned from it all. We are learning so much every day, and this section in the Dream DAO is a great place to sum it all up.  We aim to ensure that the Dream DAO becomes a blueprint and adds value to hundreds of communities to come.

### Working Group Key Takeaways ✍️

1. **Notion Docs for Productive Meetings: An 8-section Anatomy**
    - A prepared notion doc is a powerful engine for working group meetings + record-keeping. As we integrated these in each working group’s first meeting, we engineered a fantastic 8-part formula that anyone can deploy for robust collaboration.
        - Open this toggle to review the **8 sections we discovered!**
            1. **Icebreaker/Attendance:** Prompt attendees with a lighthearted icebreaker + reference later for attendance!
            2. **Meeting outline:** Decompose + simplify + explain the agenda before diving in!
            3. **Progress check:** reflect on what’s gotten done + pat backs as needed
            4. **Key Results:** review/brainstorm key results to be covered by end of phase
            5. **Brainstorm!**
            6. **Progress Goals:** After brainstorming, create tangible goals to capture all the great ideas into reality!
            7. **Next steps:** Delegate + assign concrete action steps to members. Teamwork makes the dream (DAO) work!
            8. **Reflection + Wrap-up:** What was your best bit from this call? How could have this been handled better?
2. Speaking of which, **pre-readings and agendas are super important!** Hats off to all the interim coordinators who carefully prepared pre-readings for members before the meeting! 
    - This was helpful in orienting everyone towards the same direction so that the meeting could ensue in the same (generally) direction.
3. Ending each working group meeting with **assigned tasks** AND then **consolidating all assigned tasks in a DAO-wide task doc** (**[here](../../../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Working%20Groups%20Home%20Season%201%204d1702104a2f4180a27e92b0510bd283/Working%20Group%20Tasks%2076ca256d9d004fff83323d621d18337e.md)**) was really helpful in paving a direction forward + keeping momentum.

### Community Key Takeaways 🏘️

1. **Decentralized learning activities and sessions** are practical, effective, and community-enriching.
    - Dream DAO Champion QZ (QZ#6600) demonstrated this over the last few weeks by coordinating the L2 research of 12 Builders, supervising the creation of a [lecture](../../Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20#5%20All%20About%20Layer%202s%202b307e1809a543bbab9e3c3a238e6acb.md), and finally screening/presenting the research.
2. Building a productive community requires both **fun and work** - the two together are crucial!  The Community Building Working Group aims to integrate activities of both types in the coming months.
3. **Uplifting each other uplifts the entire DAO.**  We can show support and appreciation by giving tacos on Discord and posting in the #[community-love](https://discord.com/channels/896096170621947974/935712392472584242) channel.
4. And of course... **everyone loves POAPs.**
