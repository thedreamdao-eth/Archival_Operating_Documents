## DREAM DAO IS ON SPRING BREAK! 🏄🏽‍♀️

Recently, our community proposed and passed a request for an official community Spring Break to be administered from **March 27th - April 2nd, 2022.** 🌸

This week-long collective shutdown of the Discord and community unplugging will allow members to regenerate and reflect on Dream DAO, as well as explore their other commitments and facets of their lives. 

Our Discord will experience a temporary period of little to no activity and events scheduled previously during this period have been postponed to later dates.

**Community events & Twitter Space events (see below) will still occur!**

- Monday March 27th, 2022 @ 1:00 AM EST, Tim will be hosting a casual hangout event for international members in the Discord’s Solarpunk Lounge!

Check out Working Group tasks at [this link](../../../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Working%20Groups%20Home%20Season%201%204d1702104a2f4180a27e92b0510bd283/Working%20Group%20Tasks%2076ca256d9d004fff83323d621d18337e.md); there’s a lot happening in the Dream DAO!

### *DAO Learning* 📚

📦 [discord link!](https://discord.com/channels/896096170621947974/932070287091060806) 

This group just finalized a partnership with Crypto College, headlined by Saf and Jae-Hee. They have taken extra care towards making sure the organization is credible and aligns with the goals of the DAO. More recently, the group has been scheduling to meet the organization she256 in order to further help them plug into the DAO. Awesome job!

### *Governance* 🏛️

📦 [discord link!](https://discord.com/channels/896096170621947974/932070642260512818) 

The governance working group are currently working on different proposals in order to better the DAO. For example, the working group has been planning items such as the Simple Investment Policy Statement and formulating how the DAO Governance should be constructed for optimal efficiency. Keep it up guys!

### *Community Building* 🏘️

📦 [discord link!](https://discord.com/channels/896096170621947974/932069817937195058) 

The Community Building Working Group has finalized fun events that will be introduced into the DAO once certain phases begin and end. Currently, they have been discussing whether to use “sendthnx”, a platform where DAO members could thank each other more thoughtfully. We can’t wait to see more!

### *Meta* 🌐

📦 [discord link!](https://discord.com/channels/896096170621947974/947097188327125022) 

The Meta Working Group will be developing a more concrete mentorship plan for Builders and Champions across the board. After the Spring Break, working group members will be jamming on how mentors can guide Builders through web3 beyond the Explorers program and Launch Year, and create viable ways for Champs to plug in as mentors.

### *Documentation* 📝

📦 [discord link!](https://discord.com/channels/896096170621947974/932069610868580382) 

The Documentation (previously known as social media) Working Group is shifting towards more decentralization in terms of coordinating & accessing public-facing media output. We are also excited to explore the possibility of becoming more inclusive in our posts by integrating spanish content for the Latino web3 community. 

### *Partnerships* 💸

📦 [discord link!](https://discord.com/channels/896096170621947974/932070709465854002) 

The Partnerships Working Group worked super hard last week! Champion Carl Cervone and Builders Ash Kranti, Ethan Wei, and Jae-Hee Bae pushed out a FTX Future Fund application. We are also juggling a Coinbase Philanthropy pitch, CRM project, making a Dream DAO Giving Block to make donations tax deductible, and building out more partnerships!

# How to Train a ~~Dragon~~ DAO 🐲

We are trying to navigate how to operate a DAO with little-to-no guidance, essentially building while flying.  Inspired by Champion Jason McCutchan and Builder Madison Adams, this section continuously captures things we’ve tried in the DAO, things that have changed, and the whys/lessons learned from it all. 

### Dream DAO Takeaways:

- **Collective breaks are healthy!** This week-long rest of the Discord will be an experiment. The community unplugging will allow members to regenerate and reflect as well as explore their other commitments and facets of their lives. This shutdown proactively prevents burnout and promotes wellness. Although this may disrupt the momentum of progress, we hope this break invests in long-term sustainability.
- **Onboarding processes are very important!** After receiving quite a few new Friends of the DAO into our community, Jae-Hee and our new friend from Protein, [Luis](https://twitter.com/luisotravz) (Thardust#6421) discussed the importance of having structured processes to allow new friends to plug in!
