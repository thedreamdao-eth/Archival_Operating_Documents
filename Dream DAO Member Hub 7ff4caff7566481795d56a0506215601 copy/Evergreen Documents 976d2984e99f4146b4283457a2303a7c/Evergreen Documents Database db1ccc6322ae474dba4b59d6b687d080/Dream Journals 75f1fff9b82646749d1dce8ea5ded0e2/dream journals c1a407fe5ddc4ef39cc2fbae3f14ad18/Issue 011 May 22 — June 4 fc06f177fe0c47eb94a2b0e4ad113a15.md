# How to Train a ~~Dragon~~ DAO 🐲

We are trying to navigate how to operate a DAO with little-to-no guidance, essentially building while flying.  Inspired by Champion Jason McCutchan and Builder Madison Adams, this section continuously captures things we’ve tried in the DAO, things that have changed, and the whys/lessons learned from it all. 

### Dream DAO Takeaways:

- **Lesson from Aya Miyaguchi, Executive Director of Ethereum:** Often what is needed in life is subtraction, not addition of something that you think is missing that will make your life whole. Often what you need to do is focus in on and double down on fewer things.
    - Dream DAO has been trying to narrow down from the bucket of “empowering young people to be involved in web3” but we’re focusing on three things:
1. **Once or twice-a-week Learning Together Sessions** — with guests like Aya Miyaguchi
2. **Internship matching** — for young Builders with mentors
3. **Trips and events** — learning organizing skills and funding Builders to attend conferences like ethCC
