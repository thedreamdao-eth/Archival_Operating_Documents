# How to Train a ~~Dragon~~ DAO 🐲

We are trying to navigate how to operate a DAO with little-to-no guidance, essentially building while flying.  Inspired by Champion Jason McCutchan and Builder Madison Adams, this section continuously captures things we’ve tried in the DAO, things that have changed, and the whys/lessons learned from it all. 

- **It’s ok if Web3 is intimidating, it’s a new space, learn and explore at your own pace and if you ever have any questions feel free to post them in the [#ask-anything](https://discord.com/channels/896096170621947974/930951665891291196) channel**
