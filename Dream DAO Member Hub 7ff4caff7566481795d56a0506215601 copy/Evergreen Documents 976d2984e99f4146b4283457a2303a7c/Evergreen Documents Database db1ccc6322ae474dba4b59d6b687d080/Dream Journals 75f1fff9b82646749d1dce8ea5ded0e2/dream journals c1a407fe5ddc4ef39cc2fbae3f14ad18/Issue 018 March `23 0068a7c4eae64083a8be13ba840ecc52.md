### Dream DAO Learning Together #69: “ReFi with Beltran Berrocal”

On March 11th Beltran Berrocal joined dream DAO to learn together in a session about Regenerative Finances (ReFi). He presented more about Zero Labs - the company he co-founded. The session was eye-opening and incredibly interesting. We truly appreciate you coming down, thank you Beltran 😊 Check out the notes [](notion://www.notion.so/c642ec75df4e4dd0b2c52fdda3dc8977)**[here](../../Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20#69%20%E2%80%9CReFi%20with%20Beltran%209a80c32b28814b6d8efb0092d4bed103.md).**

### Dream DAO Learning Together #70: “DAO: The New Political Economy”

On March 22nd Zane Huffman joined dream DAO to learn together in a session about Politics and Economy. We discussed how decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) can reshape the way we interact and do business. He compared the benefits of the crypto space economy with other opportunities such as the gig economy and startup/tech industry, as well as the Marxist assessment of capitalism and the socialist model, ultimately proposing that DAOs could provide a possible solution to the inefficiencies and inequities of the current economic system dominated by capitalism.😊 Check out the notes [](notion://www.notion.so/c642ec75df4e4dd0b2c52fdda3dc8977)**[here](../../Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20#70%20%E2%80%9CDAO%20The%20New%20Polit%20ef4a7b348195466aa6e28428463fd291.md).**

### Dream DAO Learning Together #71: “Soulbound Tokens”

On March 25th Nishant Bhaskar joined dream DAO to learn together in a session about Lomads, a platform that helps DAOs organize themselves and make payments based on tasks and milestones. 

Nishant, co-founder, explained the concept of NFTs and how they can be used as digital identity tokens called soulbound tokens. These tokens represent a person or entity and cannot be transferred to others. Nishant also discussed how soulbound tokens can be used to record music and track tasks and milestones in the Lomads platform. The discussion included topics such as *encryption*, *reputation tokens*, and *governance*.😊 Check out  the notes [](notion://www.notion.so/c642ec75df4e4dd0b2c52fdda3dc8977)[here](../../Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20#71%20%E2%80%9CSoulbound%20Tokens%E2%80%9D%20d29f27f318904bb0a66843261401db0a.md)**.**

### Dream DAO Learning Together #72: “Improving DAOs”

On March 30th we had an open discussion about this [article](https://consent.yahoo.com/v2/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_d4371ee6-c41f-4da6-b512-08febd5c5007)!
Questions and Infos that sparkle our conversation: Scaling DAOs is a pressing issue. Does web3 have a branding issue?  Or are there actual structural issues? How do we Descentralize? 😊 Check out the notes for answeres [](notion://www.notion.so/c642ec75df4e4dd0b2c52fdda3dc8977)[here](../../Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20#72%20%E2%80%9CImproving%20DAOs%E2%80%9D%206ff1e83d4c9d45319758dfbffa516695.md)**.**
