# How to Train a ~~Dragon~~ DAO 🐲

We are trying to navigate how to operate a DAO with little-to-no guidance, essentially building while flying.  Inspired by Champion Jason McCutchan and Builder Madison Adams, this section continuously captures things we’ve tried in the DAO, things that have changed, and the whys/lessons learned from it all. 

### Dream DAO Takeaways:

- **People who map systems and find synergies** are undervalued, and that needs to change
- **Building for spontaneity** is key - be flexible
- An environment has everything to do with the **experiences of the people in it**, so it must be carefully designed

# More Ways to Plug In 🔌

### Attend Learning Together Sessions 📖

There is no better way to plug in with the Dream DAO than Learning Together sessions!
