# How to Train a ~~Dragon~~ DAO 🐲

We are trying to navigate how to operate a DAO with little-to-no guidance, essentially building while flying.  Inspired by Champion Jason McCutchan and Builder Madison Adams, this section continuously captures things we’ve tried in the DAO, things that have changed, and the whys/lessons learned from it all. 

### **Tooling** Takeaways ✍️

1. We onboarded **Snapshot,** a great **governance tool for DAOs** 📸
    - We introduced a seamless tool to ensure that only SkywalkerZ holders, our Champions and Builders, are able to vote on our [**first two proposals**](https://snapshot.org/#/thedreamdao.eth)!
2. Charting **uncharted technology** for virtual meetings 🖥️
    - We experimented with a switch from Zoom to a platform known as “[**Butter**](https://www.butter.us/)” to open up a number of **interactive avenues to virtual meetings**.  It’s good to try new things!

### Community Key Takeaways 🏘️

1. Accomodating **geographic inclusivity** 🌏
    - When the DAO spans 6 continents, inclusive stewarding means **diverse scheduling** — early AM meetings and late PM meetings in EST.
2. **Bounties** are a really effective way to **recruit talent** to your DAO! ⛹️
    - A **bounty** is a useful chunk of work that you are **open to anyone doing effectively**. For example, UX design could be set as a bounty and anyone can permissonlessly create a mock-up the Dream DAO community likes in exchange for entering the community as a new member!
        - **But extra nuance sauce:** the DAO should be able to dispatch bounties but people should also be able to externally propose needs/bounty use-cases and negotiate their compensation

# More Ways to Plug In 🔌

### Attend Learning Together Sessions 📖
