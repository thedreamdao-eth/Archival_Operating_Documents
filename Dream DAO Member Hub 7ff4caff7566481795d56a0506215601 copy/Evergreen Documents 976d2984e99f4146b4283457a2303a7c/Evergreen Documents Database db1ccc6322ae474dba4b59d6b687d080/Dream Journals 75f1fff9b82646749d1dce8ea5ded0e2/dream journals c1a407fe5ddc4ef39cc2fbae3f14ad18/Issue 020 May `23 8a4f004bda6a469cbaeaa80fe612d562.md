# Learning Togethers of the Month ✍️

### Dream DAO Learning Together #75: “Web3 and Social Impact”

On May 8, 2023, **[Almond Hdz](https://twitter.com/oyealmond)** presented more about **[Giveth](https://giveth.io/)** and the key challenges faced by nonprofits and social impact organizations. The presentation shed light on how Web3 technology can pave the way for innovative solutions, empowering us to overcome these obstacles and create lasting impact.

- Giveth is a #web3 donation platform that funds impactful projects using Blockchain for low-barrier, fee-free funding.
- Nonprofits often face limitations in funding and access to networks and partnerships. Web3 technology has the potential to solve these issues. The GIV Token plays a vital role in empowering governance, rewarding participants, and fostering a strong community culture.
