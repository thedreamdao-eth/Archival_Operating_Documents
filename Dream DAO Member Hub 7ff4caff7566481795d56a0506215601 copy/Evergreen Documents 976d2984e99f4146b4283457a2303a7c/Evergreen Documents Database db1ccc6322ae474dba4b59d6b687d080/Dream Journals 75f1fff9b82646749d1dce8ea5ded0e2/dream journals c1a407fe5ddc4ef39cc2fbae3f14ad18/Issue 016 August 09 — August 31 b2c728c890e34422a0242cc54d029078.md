# Dream DAO @ETH conferences

---

### Dream DAO @Web3Conf Goa, India

Builders: Aditya, Madhav, Adrash and Champion: Shaan embark their journey to Web3Conf in India,GOA on 12th-14th August! 

**Reflections:** 

Conferences are amazing places where some of the best minds gather but one needs to be deliberate about whether the next meetup or conference is worth it or not. its easy to fall in the hole of looking for the next event but its important to remember what value these places provide. There were a lot of times during the trip we had to call shots and see whether the party or networking event was worth it or not and happy that most of had the guts to do so!
