Every Sunday, Builder Oliver Yehlik hosts a *fantastic* solarpunk study group.  Here’s what he has to say about it!

> “I’m so glad to have been able to organize and participate in the solarpunk study group these past 2 months.  I feel like we’ve learned so much in such a short time, and I’m endlessly excited for the future we’ve been imagining together.  We got this, so long as we stay hopeful and dream big!”

# How to Train a ~~Dragon~~ DAO 🐲

We are trying to navigate how to operate a DAO with little-to-no guidance, essentially building while flying.  Inspired by Champion Jason McCutchan and Builder Madison Adams, this section continuously captures things we’ve tried in the DAO, things that have changed, and the whys/lessons learned from it all. 

### Dream DAO Takeaways:

- **In-person convening:** In-person convening is important! Try to host these when you can because it’s importantly not only to catch up but allow gatherings that strengthen relationships
- **Wellness and unplugging:** The Dream DAO recently incorprated a [#wellness-and-unplugging channel](https://discord.com/channels/896096170621947974/950201587941376040) to communicate and encourage periods of rest & wellness within the community!
- **Spontaneous Voice Channel Hangouts:** Dream DAO’s Solarpunk Louge voice channel is one of the best ways to hangout with other members! Drop by to enjoy our Solarpunk music bot and perhaps someone will join you for a chat!

# More Ways to Plug In 🔌

Fascinating speakers are invited multiple times per week, and our collective knowledge grows by leaps and bounds.  If you can, join the meetings!  You can stay on top of the schedule by **[adding the Dream DAO calendar](../../../../Guides%20&%20How-To%E2%80%99s%2063c1f45fab634aeaa80bf88fbf4b1c2c/Adding%20Dream%20DAO%20Calendar%20to%20your%20Calendar%20df9b1a19ee2d4ced867f362eb5e84c10.md)**.

# Shoutouts & Virtual Hugs 🤗

**Big virtual hugs to all members of the Community Building Working Group!** 🏘️

- The Community Building working group has completed their first few meeting and set up ideas/plans for upcoming fun events for the DAO. They tried to make it less about productivity and focused moreso on events that would include multiple interests and fun activities. Thank you for your hard work so far!!!

 **Huge Shoutout to certain builders improving the DAO, and speaking out to help others!** 🗣️

- Thank you to Jae-Hee, Arman, Arath, Vedanth, and Aishah for recognizing disconnections between the DAO and its builders, and for the honest following discussion on how to improve the DAO’s infrastructure based on governance and distributing opportunities!
- These people have also reached out to other DAO builders to help them get plugged in and help strengthen the DAO overall :)

**Virtual hugs to Oliver, an awesome Solarpunk!** ☀️

- Oliver has been working hard to improve the study group by being more inclusive of topics outside solarpunk ideologies to enunciate collective intelligence. By proposing multiple study groups, distributing his power to others to bring in more diverse ideas, and helping out study group members with less time on their hands by allowing them to learn from other study group member’s learning, Oliver has been killing it! Awesome job :)

**Virtual hugs to builders for starting up the Dream DAO blog!** ✏️

- In order to successfully document the DAO’s journey, Tim alongside Jae-Hee, Arman, and Joshua have created a blog and having been drafting and successfully launched the blog series. Can’t wait to see how it turns out!!!

**Last, but definitely not least...HUGE shoutout to Jae-Hee + Charlotte for recruiting me (Emmani) and Ahuyn for the Dream Journal!** 📚

- We are so excited to be embarking on this journey with y’all, and can’t wait to see what we create together :)))

# ***Thank you for committing to the Dream DAO!  We could not be more excited to keep building the future of our dreams!*** 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
