# How to Train a ~~Dragon~~ DAO 🐲

We are trying to navigate how to operate a DAO with little-to-no guidance, essentially building while flying.  Inspired by Champion Jason McCutchan and Builder Madison Adams, this section continuously captures things we’ve tried in the DAO, things that have changed, and the whys/lessons learned from it all. 

### Dream DAO Takeaways:

- There is so much to learn about regenerating our world, but it’s **better to start now** than never!
- **Diversity and inclusion** requires intentional effort.
    - Going about business as normal will keep the status quo; action must be specific.
- Large projects should be broken down into **smaller steps** to seem less overwhelming and more manageable.
    - Allow lots of time for planning and be reasonable about what can be achieved in a specified time frame.
- **It’s okay** to unplug.  If your effort is detrimental to your own health, take a break, and come back when you can give more in a safe way.

# More Ways to Plug In 🔌

### Attend Learning Together Sessions 📖

There is no better way to plug in with the Dream DAO than [Learning Together sessions](../../Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8.md)!  Fascinating speakers are invited multiple times per week, and our collective knowledge grows by leaps and bounds.  If you can, join the meetings!  You can stay on top of the schedule by **[adding the Dream DAO calendar](../../../../Guides%20&%20How-To%E2%80%99s%2063c1f45fab634aeaa80bf88fbf4b1c2c/Adding%20Dream%20DAO%20Calendar%20to%20your%20Calendar%20df9b1a19ee2d4ced867f362eb5e84c10.md)** and checking your email for invitations.

### Host a Learning Together Session 🍎

The Dream DAO is always looking forward to bring in more individuals to share their unique experiences & learnings by preparing a short [Learning Together](../../Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8.md) lecture for an open dialogue!  If you are interested in sharing your story, please contact Charlotte (**Charlotte Bruderly#3859**) on Discord!
