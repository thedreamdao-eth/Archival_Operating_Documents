### Dream Dao Learning Together #31: "Art and Web3”

On the 14th of June, Dream Dao had the pleasure of having Colton Orr (a character artist on Spider-Man) speak to the Dream DAO community about what’s it like to work full-time for a DAO and about his Artwork! It was an eye-opening session as we caught a glimpse of the process behind the art he creates and the experiences he shared. Check out his Art portfolio [here!](https://coltono.com/) Notes from the meeting and the recording are available [here](notion://www.notion.so/27e6399be0be4b7482d7643f470dffaa). 

### Dream Dao Learning Together #32: “The Bounty for Basura”

On June 16th, Dream DAO members watched a movie called “The Bounty for Basura”, which was about using blockchain technology to make a bounty out of garbage.

# How to Train a ~~Dragon~~ DAO 🐲

We are trying to navigate how to operate a DAO with little-to-no guidance, essentially building while flying.  Inspired by Champion Jason McCutchan and Builder Madison Adams, this section continuously captures things we’ve tried in the DAO, things that have changed, and the whys/lessons learned from it all. 

### Dream DAO Takeaways:

- The importance of resilience and taking the next step forward even if you don’t know what the future will look like
- We often take for granted how valuable and great a person is until they are gone

# More Ways to Plug In 🔌

### **Builders we need you!** 🌻

Dream DAO is looking for testimonials from the Builders! If you feel like your life has been changed already because of dream DAO, we would REALLY appreciate you writing a 3/4/5 sentence testimonial of how. **These testimonials are key for raising money for our operations,** especially because we are way too early to have success stories like "<insert name> launched <insert company> thanks to dream dao"
**You can send your testimonials to Arman (Karl(he)#2965)** 

### Attend Learning Together Sessions 📖

There is no better way to plug in with the Dream DAO than [Learning Together sessions](../../Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8.md)!  Fascinating speakers are invited multiple times per week, and our collective knowledge grows by leaps and bounds.  If you can, join the meetings!  You can stay on top of the schedule by **[adding the Dream DAO calendar](../../../../Guides%20&%20How-To%E2%80%99s%2063c1f45fab634aeaa80bf88fbf4b1c2c/Adding%20Dream%20DAO%20Calendar%20to%20your%20Calendar%20df9b1a19ee2d4ced867f362eb5e84c10.md)** and checking your email for invitations.
