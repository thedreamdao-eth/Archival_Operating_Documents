### Learning Together #19: “How We Unite Humanity” 🌍

On Saturday, the Dream DAO held Learning Together #19 with Elliot Bayev, the founder of Global Unity.

### Learning Together #20: “How to Create an NFT Without Writing Any Code” 🖼️

It was a busy Saturday in the Dream DAO; after Learning Together #19, Learning Together #20 commenced!  Samina from ThirdWeb walked us through the platform and a hypothetical NFT drop.  It was a fascinating presentation!

# How to Train a ~~Dragon~~ DAO 🐲

We are trying to navigate how to operate a DAO with little-to-no guidance, essentially building while flying.  Inspired by Champion Jason McCutchan and Builder Madison Adams, this section continuously captures things we’ve tried in the DAO, things that have changed, and the whys/lessons learned from it all. 

### Dream DAO Takeaways:

- **Communication is key.**  If something isn’t working in a group, it needs to be addressed.  Issues that fester are worse than issues that are treated.
- **People are the most important party of a community.**  It’s okay if timelines have to be extended or breaks need to be taken.  Mental health and collective health is crucial.
- **Asynchronous work can be extremely effective.**  Sometimes, meetings can be more of a hassle than they are worth for members in a global community.  Being flexible with the ways developments and ideas are shared helps everyone in the group.

# More Ways to Plug In 🔌

**Huge Shoutout to Amanda (@amanda martin#9027) and Allison (@allison#8170) for stepping up in the Learning Working Group!** 🗣️

- In order to organize their WG’s timeline, Amanda and Allison created a notion doc for documentation and planning. This allows members of the Learning Group to easily express their ideas and communication efficiently while being aware of time constraints. Nice job!

- When a DAO member opened up about their troubles keeping up as a high school level student in their country, Ash was there to comfort them and reassure them of their intelligence and encouraging them to keep going and sharing their experiences. Well done Ash, we love you!!!
- On this note, we encourage everybody to share their thoughts or help others in the #wellness-and-unplugging channel! Your physical and mental wellbeing is so so important and if you need someone to talk to, their is always someone in the Dream DAO if you need it :))

**Shoutout to Gary for keeping up the grind especially when it comes to ongoing grants and partnerships!** 🤝
