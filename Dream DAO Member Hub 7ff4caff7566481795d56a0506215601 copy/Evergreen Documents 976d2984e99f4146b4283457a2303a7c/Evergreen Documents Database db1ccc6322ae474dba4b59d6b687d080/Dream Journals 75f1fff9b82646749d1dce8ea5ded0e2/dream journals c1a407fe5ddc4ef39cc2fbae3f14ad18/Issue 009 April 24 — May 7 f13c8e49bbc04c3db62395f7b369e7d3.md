### Dream DAO Learning Together #24: “Futures Thinking” 🔮

On April 26, Eddie Choo joined the Dream DAO to present amazing information on futures thinking, which is otherwise known as **strategic foresight.**  It was an amazing session that connected to real-world issues.

# How to Train a ~~Dragon~~ DAO 🐲

We are trying to navigate how to operate a DAO with little-to-no guidance, essentially building while flying.  Inspired by Champion Jason McCutchan and Builder Madison Adams, this section continuously captures things we’ve tried in the DAO, things that have changed, and the whys/lessons learned from it all. 

### Dream DAO Takeaways:

- **It’s okay to postpone Season start dates! Play it by ear as much as agenda!**
    - Because many of our Builders are busy with final exams it’s been difficult to find the bandwidth to process core things of the DAO (such as conflict resolution). Moreover, new members will be onboarded at the end of June after the new NFTs are dropped & sold mid-June
    - Moreover, the DAO can offer another round of retroactive pyaments before Season 1 ends!

# More Ways to Plug In 🔌

### Attend Learning Together Sessions 📖

There is no better way to plug in with the Dream DAO than [Learning Together sessions](../../Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8.md)!  Fascinating speakers are invited multiple times per week, and our collective knowledge grows by leaps and bounds.  If you can, join the meetings!  You can stay on top of the schedule by **[adding the Dream DAO calendar](../../../../Guides%20&%20How-To%E2%80%99s%2063c1f45fab634aeaa80bf88fbf4b1c2c/Adding%20Dream%20DAO%20Calendar%20to%20your%20Calendar%20df9b1a19ee2d4ced867f362eb5e84c10.md)** and checking your email for invitations.
