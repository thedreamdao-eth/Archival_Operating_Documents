### Champions now have a Telegram Group

Building relationships is important in Dream DAO. That's why we created a Telegram Group where Champions can have more freedom to talk and interact beyond Discord, where some members are less active. To enter, send a message to rebeca#2277 or amanda maritan#9027. 

### **We are looking for new Speakers**

Do you know a great speaker that could bring expertise on a web3 topic to our members? Tag them on [our tweet](https://twitter.com/DreamDAO_/status/1638533080414818316), and we'll reach out to get them to host a session!

# More Ways to Plug In 🔌

---

### Attend Learning Together Sessions 📖

There is no better way to plug in with the Dream DAO than [Learning Together sessions](../../Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8.md)!  Fascinating speakers are invited multiple times per week, and our collective knowledge grows by leaps and bounds.  If you can, join the meetings!  You can stay on top of the schedule by **[adding the Dream DAO calendar](../../../../Guides%20&%20How-To%E2%80%99s%2063c1f45fab634aeaa80bf88fbf4b1c2c/Adding%20Dream%20DAO%20Calendar%20to%20your%20Calendar%20df9b1a19ee2d4ced867f362eb5e84c10.md)** and checking your email for invitations.

### Host a Learning Together Session 🍎

The Dream DAO is always looking forward to bringing in more individuals to share their unique experiences & learnings by preparing a short [Learning Together](../../Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8.md) lecture for an open dialogue!  If you are interested in sharing your web3 insights, please contact Charlotte (**Charlotte Bruderly#3859**) on Discord!

### Check Out the Micro Plug-In Kit 🔌

Dream DAO members created a micro plug-in kit for those looking to plug in despite low bandwidth. If you are looking to re-engage gently but do not know where to start...come [**here**](../../../../Design%20Documents%20&%20Braindumps%2096c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae/Brain%20dump%20on%20Off-Boarding%20Re-engagement%20Version%201%20c57ac37137224295a8224db18d21f10c/Brainstorm%20on%20Voting%20Member%20Re-Engagement%20Version%20%207b368343a4f348589bd1052b3ec71c7b/Micro%20Plug-In%20Kit%20b2132a3c0e3c4ec690af4d4676c66d10.md)!

### Dream DAO Grant 🌟

Loving [Dream DAO](https://twitter.com/DreamDAO_/status/1521320643819622401) and what it stands for? Support Dream DAOs mission of training Gen Zs to use Web3 for good. Donate to our Gitcoin grant - where literally EVERY penny counts because of matching funds! 

### Look out for Twitter speaking Opportunities 🔥

There have been many speaking Twitter opportunities, just this month we have over four different opportunities. Twitter Spaces are a great way to start building confidence by speaking in public, meeting other like-minded people, and getting more exposure to web3. We strongly recommend some Dreamers take advantage of opportunities like this! 

### Join Community Hangouts 🫂

Community hangouts are fun ways to meet with the community. Check discord events for more updates!
