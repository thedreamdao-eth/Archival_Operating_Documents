# How to Train a ~~Dragon~~ DAO 🐲

We are trying to navigate how to operate a DAO with little-to-no guidance, essentially building while flying.  Inspired by Champion Jason McCutchan and Builder Madison Adams, this section continuously captures things we’ve tried in the DAO, things that have changed, and the whys/lessons learned from it all. 

### Dream DAO Takeaways:

- **Take breaks.**  We don’t work as productively as we can when we are tired, burnt out, or stressed.  It’s best to take a break and return fresh when we feel better!
- **Connect with others.**  Support systems are crucial, and meeting and establishing relationships with others can be energizing.  Prioritize connections with people.
- **Look for new opportunities.**  The world is full of amazing experiences and opportunities that just need to be jumped on.  We should continually search for such chances - for ourselves and for the Dream DAO.

# More Ways to Plug In 🔌

### Attend Learning Together Sessions 📖

There is no better way to plug in with the Dream DAO than [Learning Together sessions](../../Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8.md)!  Fascinating speakers are invited multiple times per week, and our collective knowledge grows by leaps and bounds.  If you can, join the meetings!  You can stay on top of the schedule by **[adding the Dream DAO calendar](../../../../Guides%20&%20How-To%E2%80%99s%2063c1f45fab634aeaa80bf88fbf4b1c2c/Adding%20Dream%20DAO%20Calendar%20to%20your%20Calendar%20df9b1a19ee2d4ced867f362eb5e84c10.md)** and checking your email for invitations.

### Host a Learning Together Session 🍎
