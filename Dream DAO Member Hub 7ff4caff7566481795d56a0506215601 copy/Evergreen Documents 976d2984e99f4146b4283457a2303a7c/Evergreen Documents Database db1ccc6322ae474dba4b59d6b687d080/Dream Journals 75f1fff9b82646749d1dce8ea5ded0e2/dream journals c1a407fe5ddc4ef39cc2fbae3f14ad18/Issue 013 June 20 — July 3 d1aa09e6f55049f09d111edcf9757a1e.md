# How to Train a ~~Dragon~~ DAO 🐲

We are trying to navigate how to operate a DAO with little-to-no guidance, essentially building while flying.  Inspired by Champion Jason McCutchan and Builder Madison Adams, this section continuously captures things we’ve tried in the DAO, things that have changed, and the whys/lessons learned from it all. 

### Dream DAO Takeaways from Season 1:

- Personalize the onboarding process
- Declutter the Discord server in order to make things less overwhelming
- Building a productive community requires both fun and work - the two together are crucial!  The Community Building Working Group aims to integrate activities of both types in the coming months
- An environment has everything to do with the experiences of the people in it, so it must be carefully designed
- In-person convening: In-person convening is important! Try to host these when you can because it’s importantly not only to catch up but allow gatherings that strengthen relationships
- Wellness and unplugging: The Dream DAO acknowledges that  [#wellness-and-unplugging channel](https://discord.com/channels/896096170621947974/950201587941376040) is vitally important for the community! If it gets too much, remember to take a break and step back!

# More Ways to Plug In 🔌

### **Builders we need you!** 🌻

Dream DAO is looking for testimonials from the Builders! If you feel like your life has been changed already because of dream DAO, we would REALLY appreciate you writing a 3/4/5 sentence testimonial of how. **These testimonials are key for raising money for our operations,** especially because we are way too early to have success stories like "<insert name> launched <insert company> thanks to dream dao"
**You can send your testimonials to Arman (Karl(he)#2965)** 

### Attend Learning Together Sessions 📖

There is no better way to plug in with the Dream DAO than [Learning Together sessions](../../Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8.md)!
