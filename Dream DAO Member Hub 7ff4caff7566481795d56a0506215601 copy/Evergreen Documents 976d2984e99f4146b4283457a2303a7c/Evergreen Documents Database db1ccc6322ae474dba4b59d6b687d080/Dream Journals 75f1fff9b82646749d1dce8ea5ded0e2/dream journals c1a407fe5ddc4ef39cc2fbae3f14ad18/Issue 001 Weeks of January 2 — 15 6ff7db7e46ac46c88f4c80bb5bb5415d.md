<aside>
🌿 Welcome! This is the first entry of the Dream DAO’s Dream Journal. In the Dream DAO Discord Server, the conversation never dies. So two builders — Charlotte and Jae-Hee — are taking on the task of summarizing events biweekly in a clear and concise manner.  **We are always looking for ways to improve, so if you have any ideas regarding the Dream Journal, contact us through Discord!** In the meantime, take a look around...be our guest! We are so happy to see you here!
