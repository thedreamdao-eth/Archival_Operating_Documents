I care about equal opportunities and fair treatment as best as possible. I consider myself a people person because I love interacting with new people. I will try to use that connection with people and build friendships and networks while at the same time discussing what I love with like-minded people. I find it always motivating to see teenagers my age make such a big difference in society. This is my motivation to keep pushing myself and remember that I should have faith to continue by educating myself on various issues and even starting projects. Web3 is a new aspect I'm willing to explore and learn.","For me the most interesting part of Dream Dao is incoparating NTFs into funding. I really love the current NTFs and I would want to see how it all comes together.
Dream Dao i feel is abit complicated still to me for now but I'm willing to broaden my learning scope and I'm really excited to see how it progresses.","One thing that I can bring to Dream Dao is the spirit of wanting to keep learning. Especially relating to social issues and finances, it's ever-changing and I'm willing to learn and keep up with the constant incoming information.
Other than that
I have experience as a student leader, planning various events, and attending workshops, fellowships, and internships with multiple organizations. Should there be such a role that relates to it, I will always be happy to take on a challenge",,,Fall 2021,She/her,Madhav from Fall21,Nil,"Dream DAO ""Learning Together"" #3

I am passionate about all things social impact, I've started Sigueme Voluntariado, an NGO in the poorest slums of Peru, we built 25 houses and 16 staircases. I then started Enseñame and scaled an online platform to bring one-on-one education to children in Peru whose schools closed as they had no resources to provide online classes. It scaled to 3000 kids tutored by 3000 tutors within 5 months and many professional psychologists, teachers ad big companies CSR initiatives such as IBM joined the mission to support our volunteers. My role in both NGOs was in the strategic, coordinating, and executing side to lead the teams.  This summer I interned at Fifty Years, a VC supporting entrepreneurs solving worlds problems (literally if the impact was not the end goal, it was a pass) and currently exploring my next entrepreneurial endeavour. My passion for impact started through helping these communities but I am very excited about health in particular. I am fascinated about optimizing our biology so we no longer have disease through the right nutrition, meditation, syncing our circadian rhythm, fasting, cold exposure, and choosing the actions that are individually right for each person's unique biology. We have stirred away from nature so much and lost touch with our internal biology hence creating disease. I see web3 brings immense opportunity to bring finance to the unbanked, job opportunities with those with less access to education, to use finance as a means to regenerate our environment and to create communities that can pursue passions and create value for the planet while also being rewarded for it. I see web3 as the opportunity to shift away from traditional ineffective nonprofit activity into a radical systemic change through community and redefining processes but still need a community of other builders and mentors in the space to achieve this mission. ","I am really excited to join a group of people who also hs bold views on making a massive impact possible which is often hard to find. I absolutely loved the focus on creating possibilities from scratch. What I mean with this is that the whitepaper highlights how nascent the social impact applications of web3 are hence providing a blank slate for us to imagine the future and create new possibilities, similarly, it highlights how we now have the task of stirring web3 towards massive impact and a systemic change rather than letting it carry a reputation of building more wealth for the wealthy. Both speak to the massive opportunity we find ourselves at to define how the world looks ahead AND you guys manage to tie it back by stating **We are investing in humanity's collective future by investing in those who will build it.** which also alludes to the idea of Dream DAO being the supporter and catalyst for change creating possibilities for GenZ to bring crazy ideas to life. This all gives me chills and I am super excited to be part of it. I am thrilled about how the Explorers program includes training and development not only on the technical aspects of web3 but also personal development and introspection! Super excited to leverage the learnt technical skills to build something on Phase 2 of the program. 

One concrete improvement is placing more focus on the Community Pillar described. I believe there is more potential to highlight the importance of this community similar to how OnDeck has done so. Being part of Dream DAO creates an opportunity for GenZs to surround themselves with others taking a less travelled potentially more risky path, it is where people can get fired up by jamming about topics people around them would not be excited about, unplanned collaborations can become co-founders and just a general sense of being supported by a community that also thinks bold and has a mission to restore humanity. The opportunity to learn from expert leaders is unparalleled but we can also highlight a bit more the power of community with other fellows and alumni. On the following page, a quick point is that the Dream DAO Community Principles seems fairly important and something people will resonate with, I would maybe aim to place it higher this might inspire readers to continue reading the details on participation described later. Maybe a change in the explanation of Proactive vs Retroactive funding as it could be described more clearly and straight to the point. One final thought is that for those who are not as knowledgeable on web3, there could be one paragraph at the beginning explaining why this model as a DAO is better than applying similar concepts within the CU's original community, tools, processes. ","Achieving massive impact has been the driving force of every decision I have made, my efforts are always motivated by the idea that each learning will allow me to become an even better leader for change in the future. Web3 has the massive potential not only for creating economies that drive the regeneration of ecosystems and how we interact with one another but also opens opportunities for massive coordination for positive change. I am super excited for the opportunity to leverage this and move masses or create processes that enable this new future to occur. I also want to be a source of value for other Fellows in the program connecting them to people they might benefit from leading, sharing my deep knowledge on conscious leadership, meditation, inner exploration and how to make sure teams are growing as much personally as the project grows or simply being a brainstorm partner for others on their journey. While I would be thrilled to join as a fellow and have this insanely good learning and implementing experience to drive an impactful project though. If not accepted into the fellowship I would love to chat with the team and jam on how can I bring value and help to bring this vision to reality, I would be more than excited in helping with the DAO operations and scale impact through investing in young people.

","I'm truly excited to see how Gen Z can leverage the technology to help the world become a better place by taking advantages of opportunities such as DAO to help the world be much more collaborative and equitable!

Individuals who are not necessarily leaders but is committed to creating a better world? Proven to have the skills and the capability to do so? Engaged in Community Building? I feel like the term ""Builders"" can mean many different things that's not necessarily ""leaders"". The world cannot change if it's just leaders. It's leaders and everyone who contributes will allow change to happen.","I can bring to the Dream DAO as a Builder by committting myself to learn the ins and outs of Cryptocurrency/NFT as I see myself as a lifelong learner.

I am currently a student, preparing myself for Film School and an aspiring writer. I am deeply motivated by the search for equity, which I believe we can achieve through education. I want, in the future, to have helped in the evolution of education. I believe, especially in my country, that education does not open as many doors as it should. Businesses and universities do not stand together on behalf of young students, and our education teaches us more about theories than practices that we use in everyday life in the real, common world. I believe that using web3 will be a way to innovate education, democratize knowledge that companies expect young students to have, share knowledge in politics and the arts (helping society to become less ignorant and more respectful), as well as enable our community to turn democracy into something more direct, in practice, rather than indirect, since we will be helping decentralize information from the huge capitalists companies.","I am in love with the Explorers Program. I think it is very important to give opportunities to those that, even though have no experience, are thirsty for knowledge and engaged in learning what interests them, and I would love to be part of it.
About the whitepaper, I believe it could talk a little bit more specifically about Web3. What is it, how does it impact us, how do we get in touch with it, but in a more informal and inclusive language.","I able to help with projects and events to grow Dream DAO.

My initial intention was to gain some work experience in the foundation and non-profit area as well as help organize workshops that would help students from non-academic backgrounds to find their dream major and navigate the college application process. What I didn’t imagine, though, is how valuable and transformative this whole experience would actually be. Taking a gap year has given me the opportunity to finally immerse myself in everything I’m interested in – ranging from art over philosophy to linguistics, community building and democracy – and to start looking at a bigger picture through drawing new connections between those topics. What drives me is the fascination for interdisciplinary questions. And this is also why the Dream DAO has caught my attention. Combining web3 and social impact means connecting the dots in a different way. It means raising questions and ideas that extend and challenge my thinking and that is exactly what I was looking for in my gap year. While I haven’t really had the chance to learn something about web3 before, I am convinced that web3 paired with social impact purposes has an enormous potential for the future. Civics Unplugged has inspired me to give back to society and I would like to spread this spirit among other young people as well. That’s why I am determined to be on the forefront of this innovative path and help design it, instead of just sitting in the sidelines watching someone else attempting to do so. ","One component of the Dream DAO, which immediately excited me for the entire day after reading, is the Explorer grant. It´s honestly like finding something I didn’t even know I was searching for – maybe because both the topic and the method (giving teens the opportunity to simply explore and learn what they want) are kind of blind spots in my society. Neither of them is being taught or practiced in schools, so I am happy that this gap is soon to be covered by the Dream DAO. 
What I´m still trying to figure out, though, is the membership within that community. I read that quadratic voting is planned to be implemented and I was wondering if this might shift voting power too much away from “regular members” to “frequent contributing members” - even to the point when less involved members are losing their voting power? Will there be members without any voting power at all? If yes, why would we even want that? 
Furthermore, I was wondering if there could be some mechanisms ensuring the growth and accountability among the members (i.e. weekly reflections? monthly supervisions? buddy system? etc...)","I wouldn’t underestimate the value of bringing an international (more precisely a German) perspective to the table. Both my experiences with CU and Global Ciitzen Year Academy (GCYA) have shown me that it can be very enriching to hear from many diverse opinions and I can imagine very well that this is also very important for the further development of the DAO. GCYA has helped me to become a bit more attentive and sensitive to inclusivity issues, which I consider very important for a flourishing community. So, this could be something that I´ll advocate for within this community.  
Another strength of mine is communication, and through being a CU Guide I also had the opportunity to learn how to moderate and facilitate deeper conversations like in the Juntos. In the context of the Dream DAO, I think this could be useful since everything is about interactions and collaboration and being able to articulate one´s ideas clearly is key for progress. 
",,,Spring 2021,she/her/hers,"Especially over the course of the Spring Fellowship I got the chance to regularly chat with Carmen Reisdorf and this has honestly been one of the best parts of the entire fellowship for me. What I really love about our conversations is how Carmen always manages to make me view a certain topic from a new angle. Be it cultural differences or societal trends - her questions have pushed me to think deeper about a topic and articulate my own viewpoint clearly and precisely. 
Other than Carmen, I could imagine Vivien Riener because I know she is working with aspiring social entrepreneurs on a daily basis and I feel like she could be interested in Dream DAO´s mission to use web3 for good. I´m not sure if she would have enough time to contribute to it but I think she might like the idea and maybe has some connections as she is working at the so-called “social innovation lab” in Germany. She was my Guide during the Spring Fellowship and I loved talking and discussing with her because she is super open and tried to help us whenever she could. 
","In case Baratunde Thurston is not already involved in the Dream DAO, I would suggest asking him to join, too. He seems to be a very cool person with a lot of experience in the media and with public speaking, who´s not afraid to ask and discuss a wide range of subjects. Also, I think he partnered with CU in the past anyway.
Also, I would propose Jenk Oz, a young social entrepreneur from the UK, as a potential new partner. He is known for empowering Gen Z as well, which is why he might be interested in joining our Dream DAO and its mission of combining weg3 and social impact. Having founded his media platform at a very young age, he´s managed to gather a pretty big audience in the meantime. So in case of a successful partnership, this wide reach might be beneficial for the Dream DAO as well. Additionally,  I could imagine that his expertise in the field of social media and effectively reaching fellow GenZers is very valuable for further progress of the DAO. Additionally, he could encourage and inspire DAO builders to dig deeper into social entrepreneurship.

I am trying to create incentives (grants, fellowships, communities) that get more talented young people working on things that improve the long-term future. I work at the Centre for Effective Altruism, am co-founding an EA version of the Thiel Fellowship for HS students, and love community building (I’m slightly obsessed with making sure the right people meet each other). Came across DAOs while writing a book on digital-first community building, spearheaded CU’s early partnerships with EF, and am pretty interested in crypto’s various governance experiments.","Most excited about: DAO designed such that champions:builders is always 1:1 and equal footing, everything about the explorers program (esp learning/building phases, and individual/collective outcomes), always excited by quadratic voting, retroactive funding of public goods, and dope NFTs :) 

What could be improved: I thought the whitepaper was slightly long, hard to find what I was looking for. Not sure if this is part of onboarding documentation, but having a one-pager of user journey/experience for a Builder and another for a Champion might be helpful.

Furthermore, I have been a Lead Attorney for my communities local Teen Court, an organization that gives teens who have committed a minor crime a second chance. Being apart of the program for 4 years was what originally sparked my interest in social justice, and I have been able to master my skills in communication, presenting, and interpretation of the law.

Each person is dedicated to CU, and some even have previous experiences working in other organizations dedicated to social justice (for example, I've worked with Harmonie in Generation Raitfy). They are also all amazing, funny and innovative people whom I'm sure will positively impact Dream DAO if they applied and are chosen as founding builders.","Dream DAO ""Learning Together"" #2 (Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20#2%200fd3f7fc10794288b01c926e7902922c.md), Dream DAO “Learning Together” #8: Lessons from ConstitutionDAO (Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20%E2%80%9CLearning%20Together%E2%80%9D%20#8%20Lessons%20from%20Cons%20ecb116ec0ebb4ca29fc4fbb9a7aec253.md)",,,,,,"Dream DAO Journal (../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Contributions%20Log%2079aa8266fcc44da3bb60c648c01cd522/Dream%20DAO%20Contributions%20Log%2046af1690c22047cb80036ece87901675/Dream%20DAO%20Journal%204527441905534d879752d67f40c8ce70.md), Dream DAO Journal  (../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Contributions%20Log%2079aa8266fcc44da3bb60c648c01cd522/Dream%20DAO%20Contributions%20Log%2046af1690c22047cb80036ece87901675/Dream%20DAO%20Journal%20d9105aed751c4e458bf686a96496f50a.md), Dream DAO Journal (../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Contributions%20Log%2079aa8266fcc44da3bb60c648c01cd522/Dream%20DAO%20Contributions%20Log%2046af1690c22047cb80036ece87901675/Dream%20DAO%20Journal%20486f89e2dd2f4847a5ee084f841b87f9.md)",3,2,,,

I've always been looking to impact as many people as possible, and want to take an active role (both as a participant and builder) in the cultivation of Gen Z talent. Having recently learned about cause areas and impact metrics in effective altruism, I want to take those learnings and apply them to my new interest in web3. Thus, I think DreamDAO with its social impact emphasis meshes well with my aspirations. ","I'm most excited about the cultivation of web3 interest, especially in terms of incentivization of learning. It's an interesting angle to look at it from a research grant POV, which I think has a lot of potential. However, I would give more thought to the ETH incentive for the Explorer/Accelerator programs, because it seems unwise to invest 1-10 ETH upfront to someone who might not have a track record of success. Consider maybe a merit-based grant distribution system of increments over their research timeline, or scheduled payouts on a monthly/bimonthly basis? (I also commented on the one-pager with thoughts and will send you, Gary, an email with some more thoughts.)","I think my background helps me a lot in the ideation/execution phase. I work well with metrics, timelines, and KPIs/OKRs and it should help with early-stage organization as a DAO. Hopefully, I can put it to use even when (and if) I become a builder in terms of organizing teams on initiatives, suggesting action items for others' ideas, and setting goals for the group.

I recently joined Catchlight Capital Partners as the first hire to help founders navigate through the complexities caused by the global geopolitical tensions. On the side, I am an expert at Impact Collective, mentor at Startup Bootcamp and Korean Institute of Startup and Entrepreneurship Development, where I hold office hours and teachclasses on navigating early stage challenges startups face. I am also an active angel investor/advisor, working with founders interested in financial and social impact. I have also built a community of Korean ex-Googlers, which works with founders in every stage of their journey from from fundraising to M&As. 

I care about opportunities that can make founders' experience less stressful, so that it can accessible to all and welcoming to those who have a vision to make the world a better place. My focus started in mental health, but now I am looking to help people solve problems of all levels as I got to see that it's holistic solutions to the probelms that matter.

My work life has to do with intersection of web3 as I am personally getting more involved across multiple DAOs and betting a lot of personal money into web3 endeavors. I have been asked by several communities to help spearhead their discord channels and provide insights from a VC to help fuel the innovation on these sides. I also see the need to see what the young people need to continue learning, as the biggest risk for a VC is that we stop learning and get stuck in the old way of thinking. I also like that the young generation is redefining how business can be done and bring ethics to business. I have been trying to redefine what angel investment means as well and hope to bring my network and energy to the young community to keep the new innovations coming.

I often find myself alternating between sensemaking, the military, and aquatics. 
I am passionate about the effective utilization of force. In the future, I plan to combine robotics and humanitarian aid as an officer in the Corps of Engineers. I want to explore the intersection of web3 and social impact because I see it as a dynamic alternative to age-old bureaucratic systems. I continue to see Dream DAO as ""peak C/U.""

I am currently involved in several social impact projects in my community and internationally, I am currently working on a project about financial education, which I have designed to help people get interested in this topic and care about it.
A leader is always in constant training and looking for opportunities, this is the main reason why I want to explore web3  x social impact and obviously be part of Dream DAO.","After reading the Dream DAO whitepaper, I found it very interesting and looking forward to be part of it! In the whitepaper everything is very well explained, the mission, the vision, why it was necessary to create this and why they are looking for people to support this initiative 🤩.
Everything is very well organized and very easy to read and access, so I consider that the whitepaper and the design is incredible.","I would contribute everything in my hands, with my abilities and superpowers, from learning to help and research and contribute to this initiative that I think is great and very interesting.",Arman Singh - Karl(he)#2965,,Fall 2021,he/him,"I consider that many people can be part of the Dream DAO, from CU builders like Arath and Julieta!","I have met these people thanks to different networks, programs and platforms. Arman and Jenny (CU Builders), several people from Rise like Carol, Danielle, Ana Gabriela and Armando.
Potential Champions I do not know personally as various activists and entrepreneurs but I have been part of their programs as Ricardo Salinas Pliego and Bécalos.","Dream DAO ""Learning Together"" #1

I work for the MCC MediaLab at NYU and help promote software literacy among creatives, and am the course assistant for a poetic computation class. I want to explore the intersection of web3 and social impact to ensure that the space doesn't get co-opted by those who only see its potential for profit, and because I think that DAOs and decentralized tech can pioneer innovative forms of government that can help tackle some of our world's most pressing challenges.","Things I'm excited about:
- experimenting with a merit-informed voting structure. I think that because of its value-based mission Dream DAO has a lot of potential to make sure that DAO tooling is used in innovative and ethical ways to build a healthy community.
- onboarding more young people + underrepresented groups in the web3 space
Improvements for design:
- More graphics! I think that the explanation of the voting system especially would make a lot more sense to a general audience if it was explained with a diagram or graphic.
- Having a glossary of key web3 terms for beginners","As well as skills in user research / ux that I've demonstrated thus far, I also have skills in digital marketing and content creation, copywriting, and product strategy - I have experience working with startups and a venture capital firm, and have previously consulted with 2 startups on their go-to-market strategy.",,,,she/they,"Anyone from the tech / vc club on campus I'm involved in, NYU SVS (http://nyusvs.org/

That might sound generic, but I've been working in influential positions at nine organisations which focus on issues from Art Equity to Racial Justice, which has allowed me to expand what matters to me and develop my own understanding of collaboration, leadership and creativity. I wish to explore the intersection of web3 and social impact for two reasons. First, web3 is an living embodiment of active citizenship, except the citizens are neither limited to a country, nor to certain social background. It allows its users to ACTIVELY and INDEPENDENTLY engage in matters of concern. Since civic engagement is crucial for social impact and that web3 is an epitome of the former, I wish to explore this are a bit more as I, literally, see the light. Second, I am disenchanted by nerve wracking impact of web2 on promoting an attention based economy, consumerism and inherently causing damages to environment far more exponential than web3. I might not be well versed in the details of the latter duo, but I must say that Web2 really displayed an ugly side of capitalism, Web3 just shows a democratic and a liveable side of it, and this is why I choose to explore how Web3 influences Social Impact :)","I am most excited about the DREAM DAO Explorers Program! I love the amount of engagement that is expected from an explorer to fully engage in the programme. The Design of the Roadmap, NFTs, Voting, Grants and Programs are SMART indeed, except there is still a scope for the Builder induction to be SMARTIE, i.e, Inclusive and Equitable of people who have the potential to commit to web3 and social impact. As a CU fall 2021 fellow, I've noticed many of my peers are initially with the thought - ""nah, I'm not a IT person, tech isn't my thing, just bland lines of code"" who would later describe the same virtual space as - ""the best thing that'd ever happen to them"". If we promote the CU builders and make them more mindful of web3 enough to let their curiosity sparkle, that's the best thing that can ever happen to an ever inclusive, equitable, intergenerational DAO. This can be as simple as hosting a bonfire/ office hour/ junto meeting, but would definitely encourage the CU builder community as a whole to take a leap in Web3 together!!","All I can bring at its pinnacle is commitment! As a builder I can bring collaboration for projects, different set of perspectives as a South Asian, honesty in opinions and feedback. But it is commitment that'd help me gain more skills and bring more to the table. So, though 5 hours/week might be a requirement, but I'd strive for 10!",no,,Fall 2021,he/him/his,"Madhav Goyal - Builder,  Chrislaine Melina De Souza - Champion, Jae-Hee - Builder, Latisha Lil'Li -

I know that might sound weird considering that I’m applying for a position at an organization that’s working with crypto. But that’s exactly why I needed to apply. I want to be the environmental voice of reason in a place where this is much needed. I truly want the Dream DAO and Civics Unplugged to succeed but I don’t want it to lose what it stands for along the way. About a month ago, I had the honor of representing a Swiss Youth NGO at COP26, the United Nations Climate Change Conference. I’ve heard lots of interesting perspectives and opinions from all around the world during my time there but there is one thing I often hear that I don’t agree with. We don’t need to change everything about how our society works, and we don’t need to suppress innovation. We just need to find ways how to do those things in a sustainable way. The same thing goes for web3. Ethereum Mining is extremely carbon-intensive. One NFT has an estimated carbon footprint of a bit more than one month living like the average European. If you want to go down this path, then it needs to be at least carbon neutral. I think that the idea behind the Dream DAO is interesting and worth exploring further. Web3 will continue to grow and gain importance in our society. So, it is up to us to make this transition as environmentally friendly as possible. Outside of my work in the climate scene, I’m advocating for LGBTQ+ rights in schools and I’m currently working on a Civics 2030 Project Proposal with some other Builders.",I'm really excited about the impact the Dream DAO is going to have on people across the world. Giving young people the opportunity and resources to learn about something they're passionate about will be the key to solving social problems. This is a beautifully inspiring mission and I'd love to be part of that. What I would improve about the whitepaper is obviously to talk about the environmental impact of NFTs. This topic should be talked about no matter if it's in a positive or negative way. But I believe that the Dream DAO needs to strive for making it positive.,"As a Dream DAO Builder, I would not only bring my perspective on the Climate issue considering NFTs, but also the motivation to move this mission along. With web3 becoming an extremely important technology, it is beyond important that young people get the resources to explore this new world of opportunities to its fullest. I would combine a critical view with the wish of success and I believe that this could be greatly beneficial for the Dream DAO.",,,Fall 2021,They/Them,"Ash Kranti Srivastava, Madhav Goyal","Not one person, but generally more environmentalists.","Dream DAO ""Learning Together"" #3 (Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20#3%20395f19ec6f1243688cc231db0baa78cd.md), Dream DAO Learning Together #13: “How Memes Can Change the World” (Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20#13%20%E2%80%9CHow%20Memes%20Can%20Cha%20a6a380d23ca349c49b0c9e4b1ad6ca32.md)",,,,,,"Help put together the L2 Lecture (Learning Together #5) (../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Contributions%20Log%2079aa8266fcc44da3bb60c648c01cd522/Dream%20DAO%20Contributions%20Log%2046af1690c22047cb80036ece87901675/Help%20put%20together%20the%20L2%20Lecture%20(Learning%20Togethe%20b614e976ec4446d28c1bc1d5255b1c60.md), Host Kickoff Call for a Working Group (../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Contributions%20Log%2079aa8266fcc44da3bb60c648c01cd522/Dream%20DAO%20Contributions%20Log%2046af1690c22047cb80036ece87901675/Host%20Kickoff%20Call%20for%20a%20Working%20Group%20caa75a2ad71944fdbeff463bb295eb66.md), POAP for 2,030 follower milestone (../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Contributions%20Log%2079aa8266fcc44da3bb60c648c01cd522/Dream%20DAO%20Contributions%20Log%2046af1690c22047cb80036ece87901675/POAP%20for%202,030%20follower%20milestone%20d51058a6dcbb48628d8fb731bd377044.md)",3,2,,,

I really enjoyed the experience and I continue to stay heavily involved as a Builder. Outside of that I am a high school junior and spend my time on schoolwork, my school theater productions, and crocheting winter gear for a school donation club. I am really interested in learning more about web3 and being involved with it's intersection with social impact because I found my way to the DAO after hearing about it in the CU community. The more I learned about it, I slowly became more sure it was something I was interested in plugging into. I got a chance to jam on it and join the discord in early stages because I attended steering meetings that addressed it, which was a great experience. Web3 careers are very interesting to me, and I enjoy reading about the rapidly expanding potential it has. I know there are many directions this could take, and the idea that I could be a part of the founding members who get to help design and develop the way our DAO is structured is so exciting. I am passionate about social impact and I have had a chance to do a lot of personal development and learning through CU, and I am ready to apply my knowledge and experience through contributions to the DAO.","It's super overwhelming to dive into Web3 and try to learn about it on my own as a high schooler. I really love that the builders will have mentorship and access to people of different experience levels to facilitate and support the learning process that will be ongoing for all members, especially builders. As a soon to be senior I am really trying to find ways to discover more of my you shaped hole, try out new things and hear from new people about what sort of things are out there. I see so many ways that I could do this through becoming a DAO member, not only by speaking with champions, but also through committees, the Dream DAO Board, and the Explorer and Accelarator Grants. ","I really enjoy working on things for Civics Unplugged and helping cultivate a supportive and engaging environment for learning and I think that shows in how much time and energy I dedicate to it. I reliably and efficiently work to better myself and the space around me. I would bring that same commitment to the Dream DAO, along with the skills I have learned through my time there. The personal development concepts and especially the communication I have learned through hands-on work with people of different backgrounds and opinions have made me a more empathetic and openminded person. In working alongside all 3 graduated fellowship classes I walked away with a stronger collaborative spirit and the knowledge that I really enjoy the process of learning. I am eager to learn and my passion for social change through community work is mirrored in the goals of the DAO. ",,,Spring 2021,she/her,"Ash Kranti would be my number one reccomendation. Xe is an incredibly hard worker and seamlessly connects leadership and assertivness with compassion and support of everyone around xyr. Ash has shaped so much of Civics Unplugged and has been a huge reason for my sucess in contributing as well. Working with Ash is always a huge pleasure and xe is an asset in whatever xe commits to. ","I think it would be super cool to involve an NFT artist as an interesting perspective on how to harness the power for our cause. Artists see their work go out into the world and they watch what people do with it, so I'm sure they would have some valuable insight. One artist I like is Kevin Abosch. He makes pretty NFTs and tweets about his experiences using the blockchain as an artistic method.

Someone I found who I really admire in my personal research about the power of NFTs and social change is Drue Kataoka. She brought together 5 women to work on a project called ""Will Your Heart Pass The Test"" after seeing millions of NFT peices incorperate sexist and racist imagery. It serves as a response to the crypto community turning a blind eye to this. They held an auction, similar to what is detailed in the DAO whitepaper, and the proceeds went to The Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta and Stop AAPI Hate. This is a super awesome example of how NTFs can be used to empower people, spread a message, and harness the power of Web3 to garner social impact.

I care that people get the true benefit of these technologies and not shrug the topics off because of ignorance. Web3 is the best chance we have to put people and the community in charge of their assets and data. It's the most effective way to cut out middlemen and have direct impacts on the betterment of society which the dream DAO envisions to do.,After reading the whitepaper I was most excited about how big of inspiration it will be for other organisations that aspire to cut bureaucracy and want real impact. The best thing that comes out of Dream DAO is explorers program as skill is that matter for making an impact which needs to be imparted to people my age where everyone is overloaded with information in a good way.,I think the main reason for different people is so as to have a diverse set of opinions in the decision making for which I will try my best. I think I might help in setting long-term visions for the DAO and help bridging the gap for others to tech(even though I am not great I might help them learn by becoming accountability buddy).,Gary Sheng - garysheng#5729,madhavgoyal.substack.com,Fall 2021,He/Him,"Arman Singh and Ash Kranti

Current work life is working at a large organization with a mission to positively impact 1 billion + people (youth always included). Aside from that, I'm always looking for new challenges and adventures to take on. Working to equip the future leaders of the world to build a better future sounds like the only way to make the world a better place for all in the long run. I will jump on that train any day of the week.

I participate in many policy-driven advocacy groups like Generation Ratify to change build a fairer democracy and civil society for all. Yet, I believe that we are living in an age where individuals, organizations, and companies are moving at a much greater pace than government is. In large part, this is due to the rapid technological innovation we've experienced in the last 20 years. While citizens are able to create cross-national digital advocacy groups, governments are barely able to create functioning websites. Through web3 technologies, I hope that we could create a better democracy; that we could build greater government transparency, faciliate organizing, and speed things up. ","I'm most excited about the innovate approaches we take to philanthropy. I remember reading the doc about retroactive funding and having my mind completely blown. The possibility of funding so many new web3-based projects through different modes of fundraising excite me, and I look forward to seeing how we leverage the immense potential we're already accumulating.

My educational background is in mechanical engineering and I spent a few years as an engineer and project manager in the manufacturing industry before realizing that it wasn't filling my tank. I thrive when I'm around people who are passionate about their work, but the conversations I was having at work were uninspiring. So I switched over to higher education, where I was heavily involved during my time as a student and knew that it was the environment I liked being in. For the past 2.5 years I've been helping bright Gen Z engineering physics students figure out their careers in tech and research through facilitating workshops, doing one-on-one mentorship sessions, and engaging with industry partners to develop meaningful internship opportunities for them. I'm also very passionate about diversity and representation, and help run an organization (Colour the Trails) that is dedicated to increasing representation of BIPOC in outdoor adventure sports (I'm an avid trail runner and backcountry skiier).

I am Sam Rad. I don't even know where to start with the story of how my journey intersected with this new way of thinking, living, and collarborating. It was probably long before I got into tech as an entrepeneur. I was always questioning about how we could do things differently, shape a different reality, manifest the future. My background was actually in theater (as a writer, performer, and director) where I created a NYC based theater company for senior citizens 65+ to participate in plays that addressed socially relevant issues. I expanded this to all demographics, and incorporated tech. During that time, I was finishing my undergrad degree in anthropology and wrote my thesis on the virtual world, Second Life. I came across digital assets, bitcoin, and the ideas of decentralization and my mind was blown. I ended up on a PhD track to research virtual economies (in 2011) but started a company and, well, 3 companies in blockchain/web 3/crypto and here I am today. I found that over the years, my super power has been educating about the WHY of web 3 because so many folks would dive deep into the what it is, how it works, without showing WHY we need it. I ended up joining Singularity University in 2017 for blockchain faculty, have continued my research and participation in DAOs, give keynotes around the world, and have written an introductory guide called Bitcoin Pizza: The No-Bullshit Guide to Blockchain. I'm now the CEO of a Web 3 Communication Platform called LOVE, which aims to decentralize and democratize personal communications (and take on the Facebook monopoly!). We believe communication platforms (and the internet) should be a public utility. My super power is being a storyteller and catalyzer. I can equal gravitas stand on a stage as a keynote speaker or behind the stage as a director and empower folks into action. (If I believe in and my values align with the cause). As I have reflected over the years, I've realized that this shift in my consciousness is something that will never change and I will work the rest of my life to advocate, educate, and empower folks to imagine new models of cooperative governance, value creation, and more.",,,Josh and Gary,samantharadocchia.com,,She/Her,"Christopher Schlaeffer, founder of my current company, board member at Amnesty International, previous Android founder -- he could be a great connector on the Champions side.

I am currently a student finishing my last year of undergrad in environmental economics and business analytics. I work with python mostly using ML libraries like TensorFlow and Scikit to conduct research that is environmental economics related like doing research for evaluating and designing sustainability initiatives using relational databases. But, in terms of web3 I have been taking those strengths from conducting academic research and started to implement it into running concurrent research for web3 protocols to evaluate different KPIs mostly CSR and ESG related ultimately to build out a framework to properly integrate traditional research and development initiatives with web3. I ultimately want to bridge the gap between scholars outside of the space and practitioners in the space. This intersects with youth empowerment as well because it stresses the importance of education and the relationship educators should have with practicioners.  My biggest strength & probably a weakness too is having the ability to have instant internal motivation even though there might not be an external motivator as well as being able to have enough mobility where I'm able to intuitively find future opportunities with and without using empirical data to predict them.

I'm a leader in my community through my involvement as PTSA Representative for Student Government, Secretary of UNICEF club, Treasurer of Speech and Debate club, and Campus Workshop Facilitator for Kode With Klossy. Most importantly, I'm a sister, daughter, and friend. I'm a Spring 2021 fellow, Civics 2030 Builder, and a CU Guide. I have contributed to CU by becoming a CU Guide for the Fall 2021 Fellowship and Spring 2022 Fellowship where I will facilitate meetings with a group of fellows every week, by being a regular attendee of Steering Committee meetings to offer feedback/thoughts about XYZ, being active on Slack and Discord with both the fellows and builders, regularly attending events such as treks, democracy discourse, MSOM, spontaneous hangouts, and etc, participating in two opportunities for Unplugged Strategies, used to be a fundraising subcommittee member before it was dissolved, volunteered to help Dariel create fellowship certificates for the Spring 2021 Fellowship and volunteered to answer questions from fellows through a Run the World event, and I'm planning to run for the Steering Committee. I care about the flourishing of humanity by tackling important issues such as climate change, education, and civics. And because I care about the flourishing of humanity, I also deeply care about Civics Unplugged. It's the reason why I show up everyday to do whatever I can help the community thrive. I would like to explore the intersection of web3 and social impact because we're in an era that is similar to the the rise of the internet in the 1980s: If we don't learn how to utilize fundamentals of web3 to create social impact, we'll be going backwards as opposed to creating a better future for humanity. Web3 will people to create unique applications, personalize the internet according to their needs, change human collaboration, and provide more transparency. But the problem is that many people don't know about web3 and how it can be harnessed to create a better future for humanity. I would like to be a part of the web3 revolution and use what I learned to create a capstone project in the social impact space. ","Some of the the things that sound really exciting are getting trained in web3 fundamentals, getting funding to pursue meaningful learning opportunities in web3, hosting events about web3, developing relationships with mentors and companies, and publishing thought leadership work. One area that I think could be improved on is that I think using an application and the advice of the Dream DAO Community would be helpful in getting new Dream DAO Builders in Phase 2 (right now, it states that there is a possibility of an application form, live interview, and recommendations from the Dream DAO community, but having a multi-step process wouldn't be fair for Phase 2 applicants because Phase 1 applicants wouldn't have had to go through as much to become a Dream DAO builder). Another thing that I think should be improved on is better defining the difference between the Dream DAO Builders vs Dream DAO Explorers in the whitepaper. ","One way that I could help the Dream DAO is by running sessions about web3 for phase 2 builders.

I'm passionate about learning, fighting misinformation, wrong dogmas, and solving completely broken urban planning&public transportation/social systems of my country & some other countries. Web3 is something new to me, so I want to understand it and the ways to use it for building a brighter future for humanity. Also, I definitely want to help with increasing the social impact of Dream DAO.","Well, firstly, I've always had a hard time understanding crypto, BUT when I've been reading the Dream DAO whitepapers I managed to get a grasp of the basics and even some insights about where the internet is moving nowadays (web3), what are DAOs, and how they can be used for good (like empowerment of Gen Z leaders). Wow, it made me feel immersed and now I definitely feel more certain to advance further in this field! I think it is an immense opportunity for me, and I look forward to understanding web3 and its social impact better as a Dream DAO Builder and using that knowledge to make change!
In terms of the whitepaper, I think it would be cool if there will be more graphics (charts/diagrams) in certain parts to represent data (like creating a cool roadmap, sort of like with the treasury & funding explanation diagram). It will make the info more comprehensible and visually appealing. Other stuff to consider turning into graphic diagrams/charts are ""Benefits Of Becoming A Dream DAO Member"" and ""How The DAO Will Leverage The Power Of NFTs"".
I believe graphics could also be used to highlight and emphasize the most important bits of information and make them stand out from the mass of text, for instance, the ""By 2030, the Dream DAO will have..."" part.","Firstly, I won a big All-Russian startup competition (""Большая перемена""), becoming fairly popular in Magadan (among the individuals in power as well), so I might hold a couple of events and public speeches, promoting Dream DAO and web3 among the youth (statistically 28% out of ~140k people) and the investors, business owners of my city.
I can also plug in some of the best Russian students from the Competitive College Club, so they can spread the info, join during the next phases or participate in the Dream DAO's programs. It might also be a possible way to partner with EduUSARussia and have potential access to the best Gen Zers of the country.
And, finally, I'm a fast learner, who became really passionate about the Dream DAO, so I'm ready to absorb all the info about web3 and utilize it for helping the community grow, eventually trying to realize my potential to enrich web3 with some up-to-date projects.",Gary Sheng! garysheng#5729,,Fall 2021,He/Him,"Arman Singh

As someone driven towards democratizing social impact work — understanding the future of funding is imperative. I am excited to see how we can utilize web3 to make social impact work more accessible and impactful.","I am most excited about the quadratic voting systems and how votes can be weighted! This may be an approach we can apply to larger Steering governance. I think that there needs to be more discussion around the balance between proactive and reactive funding — as for youth projects — proactive funding is crucial for being able to get a project started. I also think we need to discuss ways to make crypto more easily understood by those we want to be able to take advantage of it (i.e. youth, underserved populations, etc).","That is all, super excited to hop on board! 😀",Gary Sheng,zoe-jenkins.com,Spring 2020,,Phoebe Omonira,Deja Foxx,,,,,,,,,,,,
