# Emmani Kularatna

About me: I am some who is deeply dedicated and keen on improving the world around me by exploring the unknown and through what I deem best. Socially, I tend to care about issues such as tolerance, educational opportunity, and women's rights. I personally feel exploring the intersection of web3 and social impact will help me further my knowledge in the social justice field and continue to benefit the community around me.

Social handles: I don't have social media, but I can get it if needed!
Who is one person you DO personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: My friend Anika would be a perfect fit. She's a very involved person, but also dedicated to those same passions, making her a key fit for DAO. Additionally, she is very caring and would flourish working with other driven individuals bringing DAO to life. 
Who is one person you DON'T personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: I think there are multiple people whom I've come across in the CU Fellowship who would be amazing to accept into Dream DAO. I think Arath, Harmonie, Rashmika, and Karl (all newly inducted CU Builders) would all be great fits. Each person is dedicated to CU, and some even have previous experiences working in other organizations dedicated to social justice (for example, I've worked with Harmonie in Generation Raitfy). They are also all amazing, funny and innovative people whom I'm sure will positively impact Dream DAO if they applied and are chosen as founding builders.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: I have had several years of experience working in the social justice field. For example, I'm involved in HSDA (High School Democrats of America) and Generation Ratify, two organization dedicated to items in social justice. Generation Ratify works for gender equality alongside surrounding issues, while I am currently the Deputy Director for TX as well as an Asian American caucus member. I have been involved in HSDA for 3 years and have served on the Texas Executive Board for two of those years. I was able to revive the state newsletter, The Texas Teen, and am still currently running it to this day, and also helped organize workshops for the very first US Southeast HSDA Summit. I've been apart of my school's HSDA chapter for 3 years and have been the Treasurer and Communications Director, respectively. 
Furthermore, I have been a Lead Attorney for my communities local Teen Court, an organization that gives teens who have committed a minor crime a second chance. Being apart of the program for 4 years was what originally sparked my interest in social justice, and I have been able to master my skills in communication, presenting, and interpretation of the law. Overall, I think my experiences so far in the social justice field will help me to contribute to Dream DAO if I am selected as a Founding Builder.
