# Shaan Patel

About me: Hey! I am currently a student finishing my last year of undergrad in environmental economics and business analytics. I work with python mostly using ML libraries like TensorFlow and Scikit to conduct research that is environmental economics related like doing research for evaluating and designing sustainability initiatives using relational databases. But, in terms of web3 I have been taking those strengths from conducting academic research and started to implement it into running concurrent research for web3 protocols to evaluate different KPIs mostly CSR and ESG related ultimately to build out a framework to properly integrate traditional research and development initiatives with web3. I ultimately want to bridge the gap between scholars outside of the space and practitioners in the space. This intersects with youth empowerment as well because it stresses the importance of education and the relationship educators should have with practicioners.  My biggest strength & probably a weakness too is having the ability to have instant internal motivation even though there might not be an external motivator as well as being able to have enough mobility where I'm able to intuitively find future opportunities with and without using empirical data to predict them. A role I really care about creating for me would be an evironmental tokenomist and/or web3 data scientist position since that's what brought me to the space, but I'm willing to take on any role as I am super eager to learn about anything and everything.

Other comments: 

I think that Dream DAO embodies a certain initiative we all need to take right now where there is a lot of fragmented thoughts about how this ecosystem will turn out and that we need the education to be at the core of how we approach the problem of fragmentation. I envision a future where we can help Dream DAO establish a Republic of DAOs in a sort of DAO confederation that ultimately aligns all the different goals through inclusive education.
Can help how?: Helping build out the DAO's technical infrastructure, Bringing in other Champions into the community, Learning and/or work opportunities, Funding, Mentorship
