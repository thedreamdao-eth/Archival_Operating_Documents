# Chabu Kapumba

About me: I have the privilege of being a part of the CU team! I care about taking a more
preventative approach to addressing our systemic issues. Whether that's through
investing in Gen Z through amazing programs like CU or cultivating the Web3 space in its early years to ensure we don't replicate the challenges we see in Web2 and the real world. Web3 has the capacity and potential to be leveraged for social impact, but it's not the primary use case; the Dream DAO can change that.
