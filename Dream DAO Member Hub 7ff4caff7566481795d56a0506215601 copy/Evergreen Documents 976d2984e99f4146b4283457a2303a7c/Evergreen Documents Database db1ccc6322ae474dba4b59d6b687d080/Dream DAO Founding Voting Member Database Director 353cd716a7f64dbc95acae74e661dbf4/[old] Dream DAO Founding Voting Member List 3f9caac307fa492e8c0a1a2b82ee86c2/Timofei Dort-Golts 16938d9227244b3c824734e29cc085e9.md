# Timofei Dort-Golts

About me: I'm a CU Fellowship grad, Civics 2030 builder, currently engaged in the "(Teachers + Students)¬≤" project, which is intended to connect teachers and students, (by finding their shared values), to further promote civic engagement. I'm passionate about learning, fighting misinformation, wrong dogmas, and solving completely broken urban planning&public transportation/social systems of my country & some other countries. Web3 is something new to me, so I want to understand it and the ways to use it for building a brighter future for humanity. Also, I definitely want to help with increasing the social impact of Dream DAO.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: Firstly, I won a big All-Russian startup competition ("–ë–æ–ª—å—à–∞—è –ø–µ—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∞"), becoming fairly popular in Magadan (among the individuals in power as well), so I might hold a couple of events and public speeches, promoting Dream DAO and web3 among the youth (statistically 28% out of ~140k people) and the investors, business owners of my city.
I can also plug in some of the best Russian students from the Competitive College Club, so they can spread the info, join during the next phases or participate in the Dream DAO's programs. It might also be a possible way to partner with EduUSARussia and have potential access to the best Gen Zers of the country.
And, finally, I'm a fast learner, who became really passionate about the Dream DAO, so I'm ready to absorb all the info about web3 and utilize it for helping the community grow, eventually trying to realize my potential to enrich web3 with some up-to-date projects.
