# Chaleb Pommells

About me: I'm Chaleb, I'm 17 years old and I'm a founding CU fellow. I'm current a security engineer working on projects with companies like AT&T and a "hacker" by night building and coding projects that matter to me. I care about governance in communities and how to involve youth in the civic project from lowering the voting age to designing DAOs to target issues on a local and regional scale. Web3 is a bridge between activists and the rest of the world to create change on a global scale. Blockchain is censorship resistant and create a whole new world for spreading a message that transcends worlds.
