# Luna

About me: I am a mother, a sister, a daughter, a creator, and a founder. I believe in tech, innovation, art, philanthropy, life long learning and the growth and empowerment of multigenerational women, non binary and LGBTQ. I work in marketing, media strategy and as a team member for a few NFT projects and co-founded La Femme Collective. La Femme aims to support and promote women and non binary individuals and teams in the web 3 space while fostering a mission of diversity and inclusion. I have a background in healthcare, finance and a passion for crypto particularly the Terra ecosystem. I am intrigued by the evolution of perpetual charitible giving such as the platfrom that angel Protocol created to harness ongoing yield for non profit endowments via Anchor Protocol.

Other comments: I would not call myself a web3 expert but I feel as though I have a growing understanding of blockchain, crypto, defi and the NFT space. I am interested in the youth mentoring aspect of Dream Dao and the connection of multigenerational members that may provide the opportunity to collaborate and learn from each others talents and experiences.
