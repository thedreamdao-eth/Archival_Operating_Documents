# Jasmine Lewis

About me: Here is a bit about me:
Jasmine Lewis (she/her) is a multi-intentional artist, activist, and scholar of life who is a passionate vanguard of social change and a cultivator of culture.
She is from Tuscaloosa, Alabama and is currently pursuing two Honors Bachelor's degrees at her hometown college, the University of Alabama. One in Management Information Systems, and, the other, a self-designed curriculum that focuses on the interdependence of culture and social justice.
She has work with a multitude of organizations - such as building youth activism campaigns with http://dosomething.org/; orchestrating music, written pieces, and presentations for Civics Unplugged; organizing regional and nationwide civic engagement events and discussions with When We All Vote; and serving as a Junior Advisory Board member and emotional wellness advocate at SELFMADE - to build a more equitable and inclusive society using various perspectives and within different industries. 

Why I want to explore web3 and social impact: 

It is inevitable that our world is becoming more technologically driven by the minute, and I believe this leads us to a responsibilty to employ new innovations, such as web3, to house spaces of compassion, inclusivity, and empowerment, for people around the world and to support the next generation of leaders.
