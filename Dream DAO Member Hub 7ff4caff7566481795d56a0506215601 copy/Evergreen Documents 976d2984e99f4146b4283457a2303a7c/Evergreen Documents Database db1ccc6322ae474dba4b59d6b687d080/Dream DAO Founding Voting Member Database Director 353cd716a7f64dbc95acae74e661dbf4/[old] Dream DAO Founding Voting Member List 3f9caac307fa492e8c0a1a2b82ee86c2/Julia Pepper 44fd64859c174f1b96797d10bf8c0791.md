# Julia Pepper

About me: I'm an aspiring designer/ product manager, tech witch, critical theory and literature enthusiast, and artist passionate about issues of ethics and philosophy in tech (some books I've been reading: Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Bit Tyrants, Abolish Silicon Valley, and Race After Technology) and making tech more beautiful (very much informed by the idea of uniting the Classical and Romantic through the idea of Quality that was discussed by Pirsig). I work for the MCC MediaLab at NYU and help promote software literacy among creatives, and am the course assistant for a poetic computation class. I want to explore the intersection of web3 and social impact to ensure that the space doesn't get co-opted by those who only see its potential for profit, and because I think that DAOs and decentralized tech can pioneer innovative forms of government that can help tackle some of our world's most pressing challenges.
