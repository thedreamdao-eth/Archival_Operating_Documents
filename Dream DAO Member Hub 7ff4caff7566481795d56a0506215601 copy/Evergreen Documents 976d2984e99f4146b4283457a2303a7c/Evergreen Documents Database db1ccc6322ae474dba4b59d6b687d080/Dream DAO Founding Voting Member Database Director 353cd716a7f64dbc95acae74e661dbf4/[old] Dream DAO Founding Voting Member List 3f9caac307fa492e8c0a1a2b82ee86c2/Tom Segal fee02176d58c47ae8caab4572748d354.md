# Tom Segal

About me: I'm Tom! I am a mid-stage millenial, born amidst salt and smoke and Reagan. A tortured Mariners fan; a delighted Patriots fan. I am a graduate of Duke University (once fired from the student newspaper by Mike Krzyzewski), where I majored in English and Sweet Tea. I have spent most of my career working in venture capital, primarily focused on education technology (having co-founded a firm called Rethink Education), with some stints in philanthropic and crypto-adjacent startups along the way. I am on the Board of the A.L. Mailman Family Foundation, where I chair the Progressive Advocacy Committee. I am known as an ardent champion of Generation Z, their passion for societal betterment, their skill at rapid mobilization, and their native comprehension of mobile/digital tools that will lead us into this murky future that awaits. I wanna give them money and support.
