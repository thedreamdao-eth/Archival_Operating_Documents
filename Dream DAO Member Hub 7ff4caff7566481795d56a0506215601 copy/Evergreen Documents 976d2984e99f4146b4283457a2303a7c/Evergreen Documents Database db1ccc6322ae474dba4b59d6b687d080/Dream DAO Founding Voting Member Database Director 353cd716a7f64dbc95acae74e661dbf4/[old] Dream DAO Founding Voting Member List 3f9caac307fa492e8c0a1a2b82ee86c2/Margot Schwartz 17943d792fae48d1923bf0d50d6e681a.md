# Margot Schwartz

About me: I am a violinist in the Milwaukee symphony and the santa fe opera orchestra. I have lots of interest in youth empowerment in general, and am curious about web3 and how it can be used to lift up the voices & values of young people today. Especially interested in hearing from marginalized communities.
