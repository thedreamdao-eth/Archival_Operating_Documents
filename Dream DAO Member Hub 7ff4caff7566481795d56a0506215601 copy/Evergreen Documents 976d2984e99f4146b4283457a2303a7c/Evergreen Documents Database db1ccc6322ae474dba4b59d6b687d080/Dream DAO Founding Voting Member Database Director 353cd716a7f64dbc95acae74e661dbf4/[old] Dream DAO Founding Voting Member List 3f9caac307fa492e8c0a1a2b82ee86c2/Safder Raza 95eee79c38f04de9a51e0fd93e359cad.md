# Safder Raza

About me: I'm someone who likes to always be learning and taking on a new challenge. My educational background is in mechanical engineering and I spent a few years as an engineer and project manager in the manufacturing industry before realizing that it wasn't filling my tank. I thrive when I'm around people who are passionate about their work, but the conversations I was having at work were uninspiring. So I switched over to higher education, where I was heavily involved during my time as a student and knew that it was the environment I liked being in. For the past 2.5 years I've been helping bright Gen Z engineering physics students figure out their careers in tech and research through facilitating workshops, doing one-on-one mentorship sessions, and engaging with industry partners to develop meaningful internship opportunities for them. I'm also very passionate about diversity and representation, and help run an organization (Colour the Trails) that is dedicated to increasing representation of BIPOC in outdoor adventure sports (I'm an avid trail runner and backcountry skiier). I'm very excited about web3 tech, and am also currently helping to start a DAO in the social impact space, which should be launching around February.

Who is one person you DO personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: My "web3 mentor", James. He is a founder of several web2 startups and I'm now working with him to start a web3 project in the play2earn gaming space, but with a social impact focus. He has been an incredible leader and mentor, and I think he would have a lot to contribute to Dream DAO.
Who is one person you DON'T personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: Elon Musk lol. He is forward-thinking, (mostly) thoughtful, and as a meme master he wouldn't have a hard time connecting with Gen Z builders

Other comments: I think the biggest thing I bring is my drive to help build an engaged community of Gen Z leaders in the web3 space, and my experience working with this demographic through my professional experience.
Can help how?: Mentorship, Learning and/or work opportunities, Bringing in other Champions into the community
