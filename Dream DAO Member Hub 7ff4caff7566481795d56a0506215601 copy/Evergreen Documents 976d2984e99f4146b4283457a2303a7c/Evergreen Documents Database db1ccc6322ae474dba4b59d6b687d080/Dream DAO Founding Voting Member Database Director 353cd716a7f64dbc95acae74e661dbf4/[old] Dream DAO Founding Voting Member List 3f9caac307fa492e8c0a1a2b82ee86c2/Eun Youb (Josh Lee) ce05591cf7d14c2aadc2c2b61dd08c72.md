# Eun Youb (Josh Lee)

About me: I initially started my career going through startups and bigger companies like Google, which I left to be one of the early members of Pascal Capital, where I had the opportunity to work with top founders and invest in the first round of several companies that became a unicorn within 3 years. I recently joined Catchlight Capital Partners as the first hire to help founders navigate through the complexities caused by the global geopolitical tensions. On the side, I am an expert at Impact Collective, mentor at Startup Bootcamp and Korean Institute of Startup and Entrepreneurship Development, where I hold office hours and teachclasses on navigating early stage challenges startups face. I am also an active angel investor/advisor, working with founders interested in financial and social impact. I have also built a community of Korean ex-Googlers, which works with founders in every stage of their journey from from fundraising to M&As. 

I care about opportunities that can make founders' experience less stressful, so that it can accessible to all and welcoming to those who have a vision to make the world a better place. My focus started in mental health, but now I am looking to help people solve problems of all levels as I got to see that it's holistic solutions to the probelms that matter.

My work life has to do with intersection of web3 as I am personally getting more involved across multiple DAOs and betting a lot of personal money into web3 endeavors. I have been asked by several communities to help spearhead their discord channels and provide insights from a VC to help fuel the innovation on these sides. I also see the need to see what the young people need to continue learning, as the biggest risk for a VC is that we stop learning and get stuck in the old way of thinking. I also like that the young generation is redefining how business can be done and bring ethics to business. I have been trying to redefine what angel investment means as well and hope to bring my network and energy to the young community to keep the new innovations coming.

Who is one person you DO personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: Joseph Kim, who is the former partnership Officer at WFUNA's office in Seoul. His role was to manage and develop partner relations as well as to devise and implement innovative projects for WFUNA. His past experience includes scaling up a nation level education integration and rural development project in the Amazon with KOICA and the Ecuadorian Ministry of Education, receiving the Award for Educational Innovation. He also worked in management consulting and executive coaching/training for many Fortune 500 firms. He is now getting into web3 and can likely open many doors in Asia's public sector.
Who is one person you DON'T personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: Alexis Ohanian, he seems like a VC who is continuously looking for ways to deploy capital that can better the world not only for the users, but also the community of founders to collectively get better. He has also been through a lot as an immigrant founder and can likely add a lot of value to the community.
