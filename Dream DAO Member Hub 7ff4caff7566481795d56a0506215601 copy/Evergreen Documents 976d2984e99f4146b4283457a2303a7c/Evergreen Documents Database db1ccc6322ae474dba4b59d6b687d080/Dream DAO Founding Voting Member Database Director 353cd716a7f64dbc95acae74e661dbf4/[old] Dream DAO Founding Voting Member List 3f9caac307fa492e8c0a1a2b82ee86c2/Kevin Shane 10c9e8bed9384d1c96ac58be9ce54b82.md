# Kevin Shane

About me: My Twitter profile says "Really into building things w/ purpose. Family, friends, community, startups, exploring, maps, social impact + web3 Œû." It's me in a nutshell as far as interests. As for ways of doing things... I do them a bit differently. I thought that there should be a walking bridge between my home in Jersey City and Manhattan, so I did this: libertybridge.org. Now, I'm working on bringing a museum to Jersey City, and will be utilizing NFTs from local artists to do the initial fundraising. Projects like these keep me motivated. Real estate lending pays the bills.
