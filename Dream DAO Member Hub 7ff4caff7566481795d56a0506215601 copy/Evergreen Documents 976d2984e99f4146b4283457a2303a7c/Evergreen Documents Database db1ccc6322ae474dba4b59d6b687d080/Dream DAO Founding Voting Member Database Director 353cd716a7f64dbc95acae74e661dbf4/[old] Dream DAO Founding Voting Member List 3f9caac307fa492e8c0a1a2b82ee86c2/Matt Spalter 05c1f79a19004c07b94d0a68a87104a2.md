Current work life is working at a large organization with a mission to positively impact 1 billion + people (youth always included). Aside from that, I'm always looking for new challenges and adventures to take on. Working to equip the future leaders of the world to build a better future sounds like the only way to make the world a better place for all in the long run. I will jump on that train any day of the week.
