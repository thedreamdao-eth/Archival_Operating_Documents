# Jimmy Zhang

About me: I am a technologist, entrepreneur, and personal growth obsessor. I am interested, though inexperienced, in the so-called web3 world but I do consider myself a skilled software engineer at this point and am fascinated by what this new wave of technology can do for revolutionizing how organizations and individuals can be empowered and evolved. I care deeply about advancement, both on a personal level as well as on an organization one.

My current work life isn't directly related to that intersection but is as a result of my dedication to improving my technical expertise as well as my obsession with improving myself since my youth gives me a perspective that would be beneficial to the cause at Civics.
