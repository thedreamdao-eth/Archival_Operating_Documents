# Jared Mueller

About me: I'm originally from Oregon, and after a few years at BCG spent a decade working in progressive causes (in the Obama campaign/administration, at the Obama Foundation, and on other campaigns). These days I'm a senior director on Mayo Clinic's innovation team. I'm excited to hear about healthcare-oriented projects led by Gen Z folks involved in the DAO, and to follow the Chicago youth empowerment project I led at the Obama Foundation by driving some of Mayo's work with organizations focused on career mentoring and creating opportunities for youth of color. While I'm on the board of a SaaS firm where I used to serve as COO, I confess I still have a ton to learn about web3!

Other comments: As someone who found his late teens and early 20s an exciting (if bewildering!) time to get involved in activism, the Dream DAO's mission makes total sense to me. I'd love to support Gen Z changemakers who are going to help save the planet, erode inequality and prejudice, and build a kinder and fairer world.
Can help how?: Mentorship, Learning and/or work opportunities, I love to help young folks anywhere in the world brainstorm programs, careers, and pathways/projects that may be interesting to them. Would be happy to invest hours in this for Gen Z members of the DAO this winter!
I am a...: Crypto enthusiast, Hyperconnector
