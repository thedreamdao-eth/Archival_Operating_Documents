# Maddon Hoh-Choi

About me: My name is Maddon HC, I'm a high school Junior, and I'm interested in politics and civics.  In the past, I've worked on political campaigns and want to make a positive difference in the world. Currently, I'm a member of my city's youth commission, helping them plan events and get the youth of Campbell involved with their city. I want to explore web3 and social impact because I feel like decentralized technology is the future of our digital democracy. Web3 and Social Impact can have a massive positive impact on our democracy, and I want to be a part of that.
