# Destiny Patton

About me: I am Destiny and I am an expiermenter. I like to innovate existing things. I care about the future when it comes to future generations because I believe that we have to provide the needed foundation for them to prosper. I am interested in exploring the intersection of web3 and social impact because I want to see how Dream DAO can help progress the goal of creating the world's next future leaders into becoming an accomplishment.
