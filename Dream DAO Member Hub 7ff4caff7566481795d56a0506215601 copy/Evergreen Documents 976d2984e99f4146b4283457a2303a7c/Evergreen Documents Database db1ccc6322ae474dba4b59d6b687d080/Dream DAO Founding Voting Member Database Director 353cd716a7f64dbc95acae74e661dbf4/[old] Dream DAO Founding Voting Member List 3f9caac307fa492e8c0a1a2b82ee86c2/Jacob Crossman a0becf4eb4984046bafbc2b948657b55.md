# Jacob Crossman

About me: Hi, I'm Jacob. I'm a senior at Jericho High School (Long Island, NY), C/U Builder, part of the civic gym committee, and also a Naval Sea Cadet Corps Lead Petty Officer, swim captain and swim coach. I often find myself alternating between sensemaking, the military, and aquatics. 
I am passionate about the effective utilization of force. In the future, I plan to combine robotics and humanitarian aid as an officer in the Corps of Engineers. I want to explore the intersection of web3 and social impact because I see it as a dynamic alternative to age-old bureaucratic systems. I continue to see Dream DAO as "peak C/U." At the same time, I am also interested in manifesting "real"-world effects in digital communities.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: I'd like to add that, since cpllege applications and military interviews are almost  finished, I will have the time to dedicate myself to this community. 

I'm liking the loook of https://mirror.xyz/ for publishing our stuff. I'm a RoamResearch scholarship recipient. Roam is a decentalized knowledge management platform, which could be useful for organizing/documenting our insights (a platform between discord and notion)
