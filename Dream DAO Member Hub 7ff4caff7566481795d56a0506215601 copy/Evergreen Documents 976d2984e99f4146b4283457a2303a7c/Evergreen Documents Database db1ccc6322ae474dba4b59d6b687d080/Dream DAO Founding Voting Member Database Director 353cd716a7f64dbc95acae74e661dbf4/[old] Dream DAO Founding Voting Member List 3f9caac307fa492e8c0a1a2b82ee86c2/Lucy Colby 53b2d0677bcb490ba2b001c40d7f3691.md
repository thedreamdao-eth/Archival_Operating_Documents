# Lucy Colby

About me: I am a 16 year old who applied to Civics Unplugged in 2020, and participated in the fellowship. I really enjoyed the experience and I continue to stay heavily involved as a Builder. Outside of that I am a high school junior and spend my time on schoolwork, my school theater productions, and crocheting winter gear for a school donation club. I am really interested in learning more about web3 and being involved with it's intersection with social impact because I found my way to the DAO after hearing about it in the CU community. The more I learned about it, I slowly became more sure it was something I was interested in plugging into. I got a chance to jam on it and join the discord in early stages because I attended steering meetings that addressed it, which was a great experience. Web3 careers are very interesting to me, and I enjoy reading about the rapidly expanding potential it has. I know there are many directions this could take, and the idea that I could be a part of the founding members who get to help design and develop the way our DAO is structured is so exciting. I am passionate about social impact and I have had a chance to do a lot of personal development and learning through CU, and I am ready to apply my knowledge and experience through contributions to the DAO.

Who is one person you DO personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: Ash Kranti would be my number one reccomendation. Xe is an incredibly hard worker and seamlessly connects leadership and assertivness with compassion and support of everyone around xyr. Ash has shaped so much of Civics Unplugged and has been a huge reason for my sucess in contributing as well. Working with Ash is always a huge pleasure and xe is an asset in whatever xe commits to. 
Who is one person you DON'T personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: I think it would be super cool to involve an NFT artist as an interesting perspective on how to harness the power for our cause. Artists see their work go out into the world and they watch what people do with it, so I'm sure they would have some valuable insight. One artist I like is Kevin Abosch. He makes pretty NFTs and tweets about his experiences using the blockchain as an artistic method.

Someone I found who I really admire in my personal research about the power of NFTs and social change is Drue Kataoka. She brought together 5 women to work on a project called "Will Your Heart Pass The Test" after seeing millions of NFT peices incorperate sexist and racist imagery. It serves as a response to the crypto community turning a blind eye to this. They held an auction, similar to what is detailed in the DAO whitepaper, and the proceeds went to The Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta and Stop AAPI Hate. This is a super awesome example of how NTFs can be used to empower people, spread a message, and harness the power of Web3 to garner social impact.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: I really enjoy working on things for Civics Unplugged and helping cultivate a supportive and engaging environment for learning and I think that shows in how much time and energy I dedicate to it. I reliably and efficiently work to better myself and the space around me. I would bring that same commitment to the Dream DAO, along with the skills I have learned through my time there. The personal development concepts and especially the communication I have learned through hands-on work with people of different backgrounds and opinions have made me a more empathetic and openminded person. In working alongside all 3 graduated fellowship classes I walked away with a stronger collaborative spirit and the knowledge that I really enjoy the process of learning. I am eager to learn and my passion for social change through community work is mirrored in the goals of the DAO.
