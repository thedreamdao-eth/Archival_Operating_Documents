# David Song

About me: I'm a 21 year old working to apply CS to meaningful problems. I started out my journey by programming and building robots with friends in a robotics competition. I'm currently at Stanford learning about moonshot technologies and exploring the world of biotech. My professional work has been working at established tech companies Google and Cloudflare learning how to build systems at scale. I've also worked at Atomic VC helping incubate startups and worked with the Mozilla Builders incubator. I'm working on a NFT collection SolGames.xyz to promote the Solana metaverse ecosystem. I've volunteered with nonprofits in the past to provide technology and education resources to youth in need. I'm looking for new opportunities to empower youth and think DreamDAO would be a great opportunity for me to contribute and give to.
