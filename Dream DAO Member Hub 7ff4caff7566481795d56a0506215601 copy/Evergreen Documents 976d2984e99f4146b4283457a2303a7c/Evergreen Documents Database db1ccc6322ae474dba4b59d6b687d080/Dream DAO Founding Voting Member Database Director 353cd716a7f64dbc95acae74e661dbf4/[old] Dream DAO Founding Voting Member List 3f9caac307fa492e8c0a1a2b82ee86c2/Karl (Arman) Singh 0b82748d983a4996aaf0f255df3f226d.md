# Karl (Arman) Singh

About me: .I'm a high school senior from India who is passionate about civic engagement in matters that affect humanity. That might sound generic, but I've been working in influential positions at nine organisations which focus on issues from Art Equity to Racial Justice, which has allowed me to expand what matters to me and develop my own understanding of collaboration, leadership and creativity. I wish to explore the intersection of web3 and social impact for two reasons. First, web3 is an living embodiment of active citizenship, except the citizens are neither limited to a country, nor to certain social background. It allows its users to ACTIVELY and INDEPENDENTLY engage in matters of concern. Since civic engagement is crucial for social impact and that web3 is an epitome of the former, I wish to explore this are a bit more as I, literally, see the light. Second, I am disenchanted by nerve wracking impact of web2 on promoting an attention based economy, consumerism and inherently causing damages to environment far more exponential than web3. I might not be well versed in the details of the latter duo, but I must say that Web2 really displayed an ugly side of capitalism, Web3 just shows a democratic and a liveable side of it, and this is why I choose to explore how Web3 influences Social Impact :)

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: All I can bring at its pinnacle is commitment! As a builder I can bring collaboration for projects, different set of perspectives as a South Asian, honesty in opinions and feedback. But it is commitment that'd help me gain more skills and bring more to the table. So, though 5 hours/week might be a requirement, but I'd strive for 10!
