# Allison Su

About me: Hi! My name is Allison. I use she/her pronouns. I am a high school junior currently residing in Cleveland, Ohio. Besides being a student, I do a ton of volunteering in organizations that aim to create a better future such as educating the world on issues relating to social justice, spreading awareness, and as well helping campaigning, doing projects in hopes that we can change the future generations by being more compassionate and understanding each other. I want to explore the intersection of web3 and social impact because I find it very fascinating on how we can leverage cryptocurrency/NFT to allow Gen Z to access funding and as well create change in the world through it.

Who is one person you DO personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: Ash Kranti Srivastava! Xe have done several advocacy work and recently, has been featured on the news in Chicago. Given xyr experiences, I have no doubts that xe will acheive amazing work in activism. Xyr work should definitely be highlighted and be funded! I definitely believe xe should be involved in Dream DAO initiative. 
Who is one person you DON'T personally know who should be involved in the Dream DAO?: Lillian Hertel. I've seen her around the CU Community. I don't know her personally but she seems to have really good ideas and I'm hopeful she'll bring it to the Dream DAO.

Anything else you want to mention about what you can bring to the Dream DAO as a Dream DAO Builder?: I can bring to the Dream DAO as a Builder by committting myself to learn the ins and outs of Cryptocurrency/NFT as I see myself as a lifelong learner. I can also bring ideas of social justice issues that I envision can be solved through blockchains such as helping out the healthcare system/health policy to become more affordable and equitable.
