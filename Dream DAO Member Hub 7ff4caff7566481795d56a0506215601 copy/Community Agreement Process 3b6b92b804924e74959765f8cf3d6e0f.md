### Braindump & Design doc

<aside>
‚ÑπÔ∏è **Braindump** **= documentation of rough, mostly unfiltered thinking about a topic.**

</aside>

1. Start by free writing about your idea on Notion in an unfiltered/un-self-conscious way, don‚Äôt worry too much about formatting.
2. Get 2-3 Dream DAO members to weigh in on the braindump (‚Äùinitial sanity check‚Äù)
    - You could do this all async, but agreements that could really affect the experience of  members should be discussed during synchronous jams, too (for example, this one [Dream DAO Co-Stewards Role Braindump  ](https://www.notion.so/Dream-DAO-Co-Stewards-Role-Braindump-b42485a33598471b88c1a6b8f0d48791?pvs=21))
    - If this is most relevant to a particular working group, ensure the WG coordinator is aware.
3. Turn your braindump into a design doc. 
    - *Suggested Template for your Design doc to be sent out for Feedback:*
        
        [Design Doc Template](Community%20Agreement%20Process%203b6b92b804924e74959765f8cf3d6e0f/Design%20Doc%20Template%208abc27b1bfef4ef2965d6d6743f7f19d.md)
        
    - Make sure it is clear and formatted to present to the community.
4. Put your design doc in the [](Design%20Documents%20&%20Braindumps%2096c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae.md).
    - Add details about the contributors who helped you draft the doc.

### Feedback

1. Send your design doc to the Agreement Coordinator *before Monday* to get this out for feedback.
    - It will be up for feedback & discussion until Friday.
    - You will most likely be asked questions about your proposals, be ready to answer them.
    - You will hav time to integrate feedback and answer some questions till Sunday

### Voting

<aside>
‚ÑπÔ∏è *Based on feedback from the community, you can:*

- Integrate the feedback and move forward with a Snapshot vote.
- Decide to cancel the brain dump. (make sure to mention this in the discussion thread).
</aside>

- If you decide to move forward with a Snapshot vote, the Agreement Coordinator will turn it into a proposal, which will go out in the Next Manday email.

If it is approved, it will be moved to [Community-Approved Agreements](Community-Approved%20Agreements%208a69d0fe98644312a618f9f7dbd985a2.md)
