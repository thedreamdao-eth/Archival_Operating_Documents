## üó£Ô∏è DAO council

**What they do:** 

The DAO council at its simplest, a medium of communication + coordination between the coordination wizard, co-stewards and working group leads to ensure accountability and transparency. 

**Who is involved?**

The DAO council consists of all Working Group leads + the Coordination Wizard + the two Co-Stewards. 

**Goals:**

1. Help decentralize the DAO more 
2. Fill high-level responsibilities and gaps 
3. Train leaders to take on greater responsibilities, and eventually help find people to take on stewardship roles in the future

**Success Metrics:**

1. The council produces at least two proposals per month 
2. By Season 3, steward roles can be elected 

## üë• Co-stewards & coordination wizard

- The **Co-stewards** are two Dream DAO champions who play a hands-on role in DAO operations and offer strategic support throughout the season. They also sit on the DAO council and actively engage in working group OKR-setting and execution, and help drive drive strategic initiatives like budgeting , DAO culture, role creation, working group oversight, and community development. In the near future, we may also explore the option of a builder-champion duo for the role of co-stewards.
- The **Coordination Wizard** (unelected, co-founder of the Dream DAO) is the third company in the DAO council (along with co-stewards and WG leads) that actively plays a role in managing and running the DAO. The coordination wizard often looks into major proposals or changes for the DAO with the help of the co-stewards.
