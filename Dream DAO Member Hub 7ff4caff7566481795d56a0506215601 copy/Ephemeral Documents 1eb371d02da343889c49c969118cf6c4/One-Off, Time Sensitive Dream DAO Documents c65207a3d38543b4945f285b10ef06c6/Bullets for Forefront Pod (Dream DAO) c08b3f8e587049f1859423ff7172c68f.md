Alpha / updates:

- We are currently in pre-operation design phase of the DAO. Phase one begins early December.
- The cohort of founding voting members will be around 50 people, with 50% 15-20 year olds, and 50% older people committed to supporting the younger cohort (aka half youth - half adults). There's a lot of interest in filling these spots, but it's not too late to reach out to Gary (@garysheng on Twitter) if you really believe in the mission about getting involved and becoming a founding member.
- The big first project we are building toward is the Dream DAO Explorer's program, explained [here](https://www.notion.so/Dream-DAO-Programs-Grants-22344032d285469ca317031b7bc4d49f?pvs=21). We're looking for help designing this six-month learning journey to help young people explore web3 and learn how to use it to do good. Please reach out to Gary if you have resources + programs to share, as well as people to introduce him to.
- We're going to be doing a lot of learning in public about the process of building a social impact / community-focused DAO from scratch. Tune in to that journey at @dreamdao_ on Twitter

Insights:

- It takes a LOT longer launching + building something that is community-centered, because you always want to garner the community's consent + excitement especially in early days, so a strong foundation is laid. We have pushed back our Phase 1 start time multiple times already because we kept discovering more opportunities to get the community's input on key decision questions, and because we're not working against an immovable timeline (like the Constitution DAO folks were). Doing nonprofit work comes with a lot of tradeoffs, but one of its benefits is not having, say, venture investors on your back forcing you to ship things in a way that could compromise the trust you are trying to build with your community. CU has been asking to help support user community development for for-profit companies, and the pressures we see these companies face can compromise the health of the community. Community-driven DAOs should only move at the speed of trust. We really believe that.
- The fact that we created a detailed whitepaper, even with many open questions still left unanswered, did a TON to garner interest from people who didn't know CU team members personally. Having a vision is cool, but many people who have backed the DAO so far believe that we can pull off this vision because we have spent so much time already articulating the how. Gary is helping some projects think through putting together whitepapers of their own because he knows how helpful they can be.
- Our NFT buyers were 75%+ people who had previously done social impact / philanthropy stuff but were new to NFTs. These people were attracted to the ability for the NFT to convey membership in the DAO and to help the DAO achieve its mission (through fundraising). A subset of these 75% were also attracted for the added bonus of having a profile picture to signal their involvement in the DAO. Honestly, it's probably better that we haven't attracted NFT flippers.
- Mixing up what times of the day you host community meetings is critical to being inclusive of people around the world. We hosted a couple calls in evening time ET which drew an American audience, but a recent call we hosted in AM ET drew folks from Europe, Asia, and more!
