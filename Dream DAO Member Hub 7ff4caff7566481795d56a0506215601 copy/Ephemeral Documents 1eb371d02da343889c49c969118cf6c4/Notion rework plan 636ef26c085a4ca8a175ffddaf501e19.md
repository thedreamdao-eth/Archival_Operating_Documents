1. **High level organization**
    
    <aside>
    ❗ Will need to think through visual representation of these sections.
    
    </aside>
    
    1. “**Operations” section**
        1. Governance doc explaining the system 
        2. WGs 
            1. All the WG Hubs + Task Management
        3. Recurring roles
        4. DAO Council Operational Hub
            1. meeting hub
            2. scorecards
            3. other operational docs
            4. etc.
        5. Accountability System
    2. **“Community Agreements section” - Ask Adarsh to draft the space**
        1. Everything we need to properly store and manage ideas and proposals
    3. “**Documentation” section**
        1. Re-organized “Evergreen” documents
            1. Make sure things are categorized and in order
            2. Probs re-name, too
            3. **New Member directory - Ask Joshua?** 
                1. Grouping into active/inactive members
                2. Linked to events
                3. Update the info of the members ***************************if needed***************************
                4. Include season 3 builders 
                5. Add the working groups relation
                6. Generally check what needs to be improved
                7. Set periods for updating, e.g. each season, every 3 months (based on our membership renewal)
            4. **Update the events page** 
                1. Different categories (LTs, Study groups, Kickoffs in one place)
        2. Urgent
            1. Should think of a system to archive those docs after some time of use
        3. Central documentation of the DAO
            1. Whitepapers
            2. One-pager
            3. How We DAO
        4. Archive
            1. Create a structured archive with different categories for different docs
    4. “**Systems & Projects” section**
        1. Here we will store design docs and operational information for our projects, like:
            1. Merit System
            2. Bootcamp
            3.  Explorers Program
2. **Think through and clear up the permissions**
    1. Right now it is all over the place, syncing permissions based on category would make our Notion more organized, while understanding permissions will help us keep sensitive data safer
        1. It will also help with avoiding no permission issues among builders and champions, while making sure the docs are safe from external bad actors (which can happen if some docs are publicly accessible with eprms to edit)
3. **Archive all the docs we don’t need**
    1. Should be the last step not to archive what might be needed
    2. Need to archive in an orderly manner, so it is easy to find needed docs

- [x]  **Introduce the task management system for the WG leads. Make sure it is**
    - [x]  Connected to the hubs for each WG (which also means reworking the hubs)
    - [x]  Is not just seasonal (like [Dream DAO Working Groups Home Season 2](../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Working%20Groups%20Home%20Season%202%20330ee854a7e3420b8dd7af805ab68b21.md) or [Dream DAO Working Groups Home Season 1](../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Working%20Groups%20Home%20Season%201%204d1702104a2f4180a27e92b0510bd283.md)), but encompasses multiple seasons in the future
    - [x]  As we are not sure about what WGs will stay in like S4 or S5, it would be best to organize the WGs differently
        
        Separate hubs with meeting logs, WG-based doc databases, milestones, but connected to the united task management system
