This new proposal has 4 objectives:

- Integrate the new builders int the community, working groups and the DAO.

- Prevent new builders from dropping out and successfully integrate them into the Dream DAO ecosystem.
- Offer a second integration opportunity for S1 and S2 Builders to re-integrate into Dream DAO in its totality.

### üí°**Description:**

The Integration Program is the ‚Äúwhat's next‚Äù element after the Bootcamp. We as a DAO want to make sure that our new members get integrated with all the different complexities in our ecosystem, really supporting and guiding them through each week. 

That's why we propose the Integration Program, a new program that is compatible with both new Builders and Builders who were not active and want to stay connected in this new season.

Rebeca has already designed how the Integration Program could look like superficially, you can look at the detailed description of what we are creating this here: [S3 - Integration Program. ](https://www.notion.so/S3-Integration-Program-afa7ab5e9a9247478ee550f25160d7aa?pvs=21)
