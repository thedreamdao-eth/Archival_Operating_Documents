[Brainstorm on Voting Member Re-Engagement Version 2](Brain%20dump%20on%20Off-Boarding%20Re-engagement%20Version%201%20c57ac37137224295a8224db18d21f10c/Brainstorm%20on%20Voting%20Member%20Re-Engagement%20Version%20%207b368343a4f348589bd1052b3ec71c7b.md)

What to take a note of? (No, not the Russian flag haha)

### **Membership Renewal:** ü§ù

People should renew their membership through a check-in meeting ***every phase or six-month period***. This meeting could be with a-

1. Working group lead
2. CU Staff, or 
3. The Membership Committee.

This works extremely well in organizations + councils and won‚Äôt create excessive paperwork or hassle.

### **Don‚Äôt add stigma to off-boarding:** ü•∞

We want members to speak positively of our community, and there is a chance that they may want to return.

## Assessing the reasons for Off-boarding

### Builders and Champions

1. ***Lack of Time-*** Hot take, this is a gray reason, as a lot of reasons are connected to it note that-
    
    The Why‚Äî
    ‚Äî Schoolwork (Willpower ain‚Äôt everything yuh, if we wish to get people engaged we need to start with what‚Äôs around them)
    
    ‚Äî Extracurriculars (Well.... successful onboarding makes Participation more exciting and gives a social incentive to contribute to DAO as an extracurricular!)
    
    ‚Äî Work in other DAOs (Working on combining the powers of DAOs may mitigate this!)
    
2. ***Lack of an Informational Incentive*** to participate- (TL;DR, lack of awareness of Current Events in the DAO, of the concepts and updates on Web3 outside the DAO and of the work relations within the DAO) 
    
    Lack of awareness is detrimental; humans, in general, prefer clarity over vagueness, and thus the lack of an awareness of-
    
    ‚Äî **How the DAO Works within** (comprises of How to Contribute, whom to be accountable to, voting systems, etc.)
    
    ‚Äî **What is going on in the DAO** (comprises of What are we currently learning across the LTs and Study Groups, What proposals and ideas are being presented, etc.)
    
    ‚Äî **What is Web3 and what is going on in it outside the DAO?** (comprises of what concepts form a comprehensive idea of web3, what is going on in the Twitter world, etc.)
    
    y‚Äôall ***Learning Working Group is GOAT for this!*** We believe in your potential! Governance and Community Building will be of great help as well!
    
3. ***Lack of a Social Incentive to participate***-
    
    Can be objectified as-
    
    Either the discussions are too discrete or not resonated in a member‚Äôs perspective
    
    Lack of being informed about events + Events that help MemberZ bond within and across different tiers (Public, Frens, HODLers, DreamerZ)
    
    How can **the Community Building Working group** help here?
    
    ‚ÄîFacilitate discussions (in terms of- prompts, Member of the DAY Features, etc.)
    
    ‚ÄîCreate fun Events (is Minecraft fun? Karl needs Dinero to play it lol, but Gartic Phone memes do help people bond in CU Community, I‚Äôll post its link in the comments section hihi)
    
    ‚ÄîEstablish a system that helps people keep updated enough to allow them to participate in order to bond
    

## The Off-Boarding Process

A template of the Process (TENTATIVE, inputs needed!):

1. Let‚Äôs make a Paperformüìù where-
    
    > members can indicate they have troubles with plugging in/participating in Dream DAO
    > 
    
    and 
    
    provide reasoning if they wish to
    
    **People do not have to give us a reason for their departure.** üíì
    
2. Then, the Comeback Committee starts working
    
    [Comeback Committee ](Brain%20dump%20on%20Off-Boarding%20Re-engagement%20Version%201%20c57ac37137224295a8224db18d21f10c/Comeback%20Committee%2055f773d6259f477992033b83ea9677f5.md) is a unit consisting of 2 DreamerZ (Builder + Champ) who are well versed with the current affairs and are responsible for the Meetings, the Comeback framework, and the Off-boarding
    
    - One of the members of the committee schedules an appointment with the requester
    
    - If they express the wish to plug back in now or later-
        
        We create [Comeback framework ](Brain%20dump%20on%20Off-Boarding%20Re-engagement%20Version%201%20c57ac37137224295a8224db18d21f10c/Comeback%20framework%20315074f911544577b674b500c91ca1c5.md) that helps a member understand current affairs + find opportunities to plug into Dream DAO 
        
    
    - If they wish to just affirm their decision
    
    We Off-Board them respecting their struggles and dignity, using the guidelines from the [Off-Boarding process](Brain%20dump%20on%20Off-Boarding%20Re-engagement%20Version%201%20c57ac37137224295a8224db18d21f10c/Off-Boarding%20process%204ba3bc75d2df4246a2f51191b39e1a31.md)

**Membership Renewal:** üíñ

**Don‚Äôt add stigma to off-boarding:** üßôüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
***There is a chance members may want to return***, and we want them to speak positively of our community! 

A template of the Process (TENTATIVE, inputs needed!):

1. Let‚Äôs make a Paperformüìù where-
    
    > members can request an off-boarding and provide reasoning if they wish to
    > 
    
    PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE TO GIVE US A REASON TO LEAVEüîè.
    
2. Then, someone can meet with them to discuss‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π or just affirm their decisionüíØ 
    - Here we can have one person just dedicated to this task
    - They ideally *have* experience in
        - Honoring Dignity
        - Respectful Community Organising (A People Person üíÖüèΩ)
3. After the meeting (depending on the choice of a person) we should either:
    - **Direct a person to a comeback process** (things to include there might be *Dream Journal,  WG Lead Meeting about how stuff is going in their main WG, and a couple of free one-off tasks like POAP* to give a person a sense of accomplishment)

- *Note from Jared M: you might also consider different time-bound categories of offboardings, for example, someone could be on a **sabbatical** (for someone contending with a health emergency or major life event: emerging childcare/eldercare needs, etc.) **or LOA** for a defined period of time, so long as they commit to return and ramp up their work by some date (e.g., by 8/31/2022?) to avoid a more-concrete offboarding?*

(someone needs to explain how this would work tech-wise @Timofei Dort-Golts?)

Is a very casual alumni network a possibility? Network as in off-boarders opting in/out to keep their contact info available in the alumni directory in the case that they are open to reconnecting with current/past Dream DAO members? Also to make sure that they aren't completely severed post-off-boarding?

Will off-boarding be a quiet process? Should we make it transparent or would this add pressure? We could also directly reverse the stigma by renaming "off-boarding"  which sort of indicates exit to "community send-offs"?

How does this relate to the various cohorts/fellowships of DreamDAO? Is this for those who leave before the cohort ends?

# Notes by ***Karl (Arman)*** :

Inferring the discussion above, here is a version I‚Äôd prefer (summarising the above + adding a few more pts and edits here and there)
