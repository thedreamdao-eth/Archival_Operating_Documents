# Rationale

Unplugging is supposed to be a natural process, as similar as the way we plug back in. This ideally involves-

- Concerned member telling that they would like to unplug for a given period of time (min. or max. what matters is that they specify in the least)
- The reason need not be necessarily mentioned if they don’t feel comfortable to do so
- They reflect on the work they were currently working on + tag the concerned working group coordinator / any other DAO council member mentioning about the same and that if they wish to pick back their responsibilities when they are back again, OR choose to delegate them to someone else

this might be a difficult practice but reflection is key, referring to [the builder principles](../../Dream%20DAO%20Builder%20Principles%20Code%20b84960ae9fe04d6dbd36b88a996eaa63.md)

# Text to put in “about”

Feel free to describe the time span you are unplugging for and tag the concerned DAO council member telling them what you had been working on + if you’d like to delegate them or work on them when you plug back in

# What kind of text to input IN the channel

Honestly anything that supports the rationale

# Touchpoints involved (peeps + documents)
