# Rationale

Ideas keep the DAO going, they are central for all of our proposals that keep the community progressing forward.

However there are a few things we need to be mindful of-

1. How do we discuss ideas
    1. Create a braindump document in the [design docs centre](../../../Design%20Documents%20&%20Braindumps%2096c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae.md)
    OR
    Have a discussion with a bunch of friends and pop in a discussion in a thread in #üß†ideas-and-proposalsüìù channel
    2. Create a proposal if urgent / important, and tag a DAO council member to get an approval for it to be put to Snapshot
    3. Batch the ideas for discussion / proposals for voting  every week
2. When do we discuss ideas/ make them into a proposal
    1. Workdays only! (Monday to Friday)
    2. Comments can be left in anytime, but will be reviewed only between Monday to Friday
3. What to note when we discuss this
    1. THE URGENCY of the concern
    2. Working groups related to the idea, if any
    3. If the idea needs champion intervention for greater clarity, or not
