ℹ️ Principles and best practices to follow to grow your capacity to succeed in web3 and contribute to the DAO

</aside>

1. **Understand that you are the agent of your destiny in web3 (🚨 MOST IMPORTANT 🚨)**
    - At Civics Unplugged, we believe that adults should not do for kids what they should do for themselves. A spirit of agency and independence within Builders is going to set our Gen Zers apart from others.
    - That said, agency and independence take time to cultivate. Thus, see the next principle 👇
2. **Ask when you want help 🙋🏽‍♀️**
    - There are no dumb questions - head to the #ask-anything channel any time you are wondering something. Also, evergreen questions like: “What are some helpful ways to contribute right now?” and “How does the DAO work?” are always welcome.
    - If there’s something personal that you need to share and get help with, you might ask about it in one of the Discord channels. There will be Builders and Champions willing to hear you and try to help out! *Know that the community is here to support you.*
    - Get to know the Champions on a 1-1 basis. They are here to help you learn and make the most out of this special opportunity. They will help you not only in learning about web3 but also with technical knowledge from other domains, networking, and life advice like “how do I talk to my parents about…”
3. **Knock your current responsibilities out of the park before volunteering for new ones ⭐️**
    - Busyness =/= productivity, and people constantly jumping to volunteer for things creates a level of unhealthy pressure and competitive spirit that harms the culture of the DAO
    - The ideas contributor does one or just a couple things, and does them REALLY well, and always on time
    - Normalize fellow DAO members asking whether you should be taking on new responsibilities (even if they feel like a quick “one-off task”)
4. **Embrace the fluidity of the “contributor” role—feel to ramp up or down if needed 🌊**
    - The vast majority of roles in the DAO are ones where you can fluidly ramp up or down. If you are not interested in a role anymore or want to expand the role to include more contributors, let the community know in Discord (or at least the DAO Steward if you don’t want to communicate to the whole group yourself), so that people interested in ramping up to that role can!
5. **Docufine the DAO’s future 🗺**
    - It’s likely that something about how the DAO operates or SHOULD operates is not defined and/or documented. Please support the evolution of the DAO by “docufining” existing or forward-thinking processes. If you have questions about how to do this well, ping the #documentation-wg channel.
6. **Docushare your story ✍️**
    - Your story entering, exploring, and contributing to web3 is valuable and helps pave the path for more people like you / people who look up to you. Share a draft of something you want to publish on your own blog or on the official Dream DAO Mirror publication in #dream-dao-blog channel. You might be able to get paid for writing! If you have any questions about the blog process (what to write + how, etc), feel free to check out [current blog initiative hub](%E2%80%9CThe%20Roads%20of%20Dream%20DAO%E2%80%9D%20Blog%20Series%20a6b763cb3b614aa9a7b2a84c13d4adcc.md) or ask your questions in the #dream-dao-blog channel.
7. **See something, braindump on something 🧠**
    - If you see an opportunity for how the DAO can evolve, please do a braindump on it, and get a few DAO members to sensemake and build with you. It’s possible that your idea could take the Dream DAO to the next level!
8. **Celebrate yourself and others** 🙌
    - Did you do something awesome? Shout yourself out in #humble-brag. Did someone else do something awesome? Shout them out in #community-love. Gratitude is the foundation for any inclusive, sustainable, regenerative community.
9. **Prioritize your holistic well-being—web3 will be here when you’re ready 🧘🏻** 
    - Don’t take on more than you can handle, especially when you factor in school, family, friends, extracurriculars, part-time jobs, and more. Web3 is very exciting. But burnout creeps in slowly and silently, so it’s better to prevent it, instead of taking on too much responsibility, doing few things well, and being unable to cope with these new and preexisting commitments.
10. **Unplug when it’s necessary 🌱**
    - If there’s a need to, feel free to let the DAO know that you have to unplug in the #wellness-and-unplugging channel! It won’t be looked upon as something wrong, we all have our own struggles.
