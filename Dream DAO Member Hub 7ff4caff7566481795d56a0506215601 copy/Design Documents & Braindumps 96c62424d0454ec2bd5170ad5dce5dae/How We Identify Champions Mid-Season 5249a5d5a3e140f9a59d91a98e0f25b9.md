ðŸ§  **A tip about Braindumps from Gary:** No matter what youâ€™re designing - just start by free writing in an unfiltered/un-self-conscious way. This is not a time to worry about formatting.

We recently passed a proposal to allow Champions to join on a rolling basis- but we currently donâ€™t have a process for allowing them to apply/onboard.

 I propose the following simple process: 

- They fill out the Champion interest form: [https://rwvpe5gp.paperform.co](https://rwvpe5gp.paperform.co/)
- The Co-Stewards will review the application and give their approval. (We will not go for DAO wide vote)
- If they are accepted, they will be able to purchase a SkywalkerZ
- Then, they will set up a 30-minute onboarding meeting with a co-steward to find personalized ways to plug in
    - They are also sent this document for information: [https://cucrew.notion.site/Dream-DAO-Member-Onboarding-46a1151958e54338bf0798e610f00296](https://www.notion.so/Dream-DAO-Member-Onboarding-46a1151958e54338bf0798e610f00296?pvs=21)
