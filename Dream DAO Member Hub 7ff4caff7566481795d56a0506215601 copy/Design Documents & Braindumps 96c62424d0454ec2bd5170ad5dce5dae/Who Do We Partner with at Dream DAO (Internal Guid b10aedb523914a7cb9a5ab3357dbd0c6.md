Summary?: We are getting a ton of inbound from people who are interested in (or think they are interested in) partnering with Dream DAO.
So the question is: who should we partner with?

We are getting a ton of inbound from people who are interested in (or think they are interested in) partnering with Dream DAO.

So the question is: who should we generally seek to partner with? And who less so?

# Who do we partner with?

### **Funders 💰**

Partners that want to fund our initiative and purpose with no benefits in return except →

1. to give them a shoutout on social media 🏆
2. to mention their sponsorship on our website
3. to have certain events in collaboration (like with Gitcoin at times)

### **Conference hosts 🎪**

Conferences that are willing to sponsor Dream DAO Members to speak at their venues.

→ Sponsorship at the base level must involve giving free tickets to the conference

### **Media organizations 🎙**

People and organizations that organize podcasts/spaces that have a vision aligned to ours, and are down for cohosting these with us with minimal to no cost.

Examples in the past have been-

1. Arkanauts Twitter Space on May 26
2. Forefront Podcast

### **Internship hosts 💼**

**Who have the potential to provide “meaningful” internships and collaboration opportunities**

An opportunity being meaningful involves a monetary benefit or the benefit of connections in return of a contribution made. Examples include-

1. Internships under the Explorers Program
2. NEAR Education Grants

### **Education orgs 👨‍🏫**

**Education orgs that offer really high quality educational programming (please expand for exceptions)**

This is really only interesting if we know from previous cohorts / trusted connections that the educational programming is really top notch and would cost money for our Builders otherwise

# Who do we generally avoid partnering with?

Not always a no, but generally yes.

### **DAO tooling orgs 🛠**

95% of our challenges at Dream DAO are not issues of tooling, they are issues of missing processes or missing alignment on process.

### **NFT collections 🖼**

- If they are willing to give us free NFTs, here are questions to ask ourselves:
    - Are they really valuable? Why do we think they are?
    - Are they asking us to encourage our social media followers to promote the collection? If so, the answer is a default no. (there could be a special exception but that would have to be heavily discussed)
- If they are simply offering to put our community on an allowlist, the answer is no. We are not marketing for NFT collections. There’s nothing more important than Dream DAO’s reputation as a non-spammy organization focused on real impact.
