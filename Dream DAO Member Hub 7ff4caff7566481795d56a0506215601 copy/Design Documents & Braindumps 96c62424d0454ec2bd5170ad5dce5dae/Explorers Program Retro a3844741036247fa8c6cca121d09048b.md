Overall, I(Madison) think I would say that this first edition of the Explorers Program was a success. It is pretty incredible that we were able to provide web3 internships to so many young people who had just entered the space. The statistic that makes me the most confident in this, is that in the Explorers Program retro form, all but one participant said that because of the program they are considering a career in web3. And all but one participant rated their overall experience an 8 or higher. 

## What went well

- In all but one instance, I believe we did a good job of matching Builders to good internship sites
- I feel like we selected Explorers who were ready to intern in web3 orgs
- The learning artifacts seemed very useful for the Explorer, and was also good for sharing about the program via social media and future Explorers

## What to improve

- A lot of Explorers wanted a more comprehensive onboarding process, so we should give that to them. In the first cohort, we had a kickoff call to review the requirements. But in the next iteration of the program, I suggest we have a kickoff week that entails a kickoff call and asynchronous exercises that help Explorers prepare for their internship. These would likely be writing out what skills they have to offer, basics of working in an organization for the first time, and researching their internship site.
- Juntos and check-in forms seemed like a chore to Explorers, and I am not sure they got much value out of them. I think the key to maximizing value is getting personalized feedback/support. As an alternative, I will propose that each Explorer meets with a Co-steward 3 times throughout the program to get customized feedback/support. This will be a direct channel for communication. In addition, each host site should meet with a Co-steward half-way through the program to check in on progress. Overall, I think the Dream DAO requirements make less sense, we are basically here to help you get an internship and make sure you are having a positive experience. Ultimately, the contributions Explorers are making is the the internship site, not Dream DAO. With that, I am not sure the additional stipend makes sense, because the Explorers are already being paid sufficiently by the host sites, and as everyone knows, we are trying to be more mindful and intentional about where we spend our funds.

## Timeline/structure of the next cohort

The first program was during summer. It was 8-10 hours per week for 10 weeks. I would say that we should not wait until summer to start again because we have many eager Builders. 

I propose that we do the next iteration January-March at 5-7 hours per week. 5-7 hours per week is more manageable during the school year, and it is spread throughout 3 months instead of packed into 10 weeks. This will give both Season 1 and Season 2 Builders the opportunity to complete internships. 

The 2 host sites who filled out the form said they wanted interns again, and our network has grown considerably since the first program. We should have no problem finding internship sites for the next cohort.
