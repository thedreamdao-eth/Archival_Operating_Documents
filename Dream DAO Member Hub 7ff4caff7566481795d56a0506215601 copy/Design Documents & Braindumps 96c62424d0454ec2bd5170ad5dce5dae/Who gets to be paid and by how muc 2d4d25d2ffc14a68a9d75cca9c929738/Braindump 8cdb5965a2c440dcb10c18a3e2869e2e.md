→ how can we ‘’reward’’ builders and champions without people starting contributing just because they want rewards?

→ contribution

→ reach / success metrics

→ merit badge

UBI for certain threshold

Extra economic/social incentive for extra contribution

### What does reward mean?

→ we want to reward people for being motivated in the past and show appreciation for them to exist

→ appreciation may not exist merely as words but as making them the face for partnerships, internships, and press along with paying them socially as well as/or economically for their contribution + provide them UBI for their consistency in contribution/activity/reach

### Who are we rewarding?

→ Champions

why are we rewarding them:

• for being natural mentors during phase one

• for supporting builders 

• getting partnerships + funding and sponsorship

• hosting LT sessions

• sharing/creating web3 resources & articles

→ Builders

why are we rewarding:

• partnerships

• innovation (e.g dream journal, solarpunk study group)

      • planning LT sessions & other DAO events/hangouts    

      • helping onboarding new people/dao friends
