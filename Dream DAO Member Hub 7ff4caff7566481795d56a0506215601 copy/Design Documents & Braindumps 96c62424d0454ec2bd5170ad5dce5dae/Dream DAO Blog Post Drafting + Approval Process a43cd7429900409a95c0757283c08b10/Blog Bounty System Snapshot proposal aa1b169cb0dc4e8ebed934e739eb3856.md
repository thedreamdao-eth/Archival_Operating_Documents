- 20 blogposts for  Season 2 which means 5 posts 1 month and 1 post a week which would give us consistency and a better view of Builders.
    - A single/Champion builder can get paid for almost 5 blog posts in a single season.

💚**Benefits:**

- Builders feel less burnout after opening up about their journey and experiences.
- Dream DAO gets content to post on its mirror publication.

📈**Success Metrics:**

1. We post at least 3 blog posts in a month.
2. Writers and Editors get compensated fairly for their contributions.

🗓️**Duration:**

- Start: Editing - Late May, Posting starts in June
- End: the end of season 2 (tentative)

💰**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**

- $150*20 = $3000  at current eth price = 1.1 eth

💸**Token Distribution: (Sponsors’ control)**

- $100(for writer) + $50(editor) = $150 for one blogpost
    - The amount is paid in stable coins and the method can change for young builders who might face issues with withdrawing crypto.
