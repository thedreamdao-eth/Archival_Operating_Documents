- there's an opportunity for DreamDAO to partner with organizations as a way for orgs that are not necessarily grant-giving organizations but have marketing money they would be willing to spend to show that they want a better future
- (Plus, it's a way for those orgs to show off their good-will, in a web3 way.)
- We could create a few different tiers of partnership, perhaps $10k, $25k, $50k and $100k levels for sponsoring a whole season.
- Let‚Äôs try to lock in some Season 2 Sponsors in May!
    - (Season 2 starts early June 2022)

Questions:

- How might the higher sponsorship tiers come with different benefits?
    - Logo on website (base tier)
    - Learning Together featuring a leader of the Sponsorship organization
    - In our Twitter banner
    - association with Season 2 IRL events - which will come with shoutout during event as well as logo on flyer
    - Cohosting a Twitter Spaces together
        - Let‚Äôs specify that we‚Äôll be talking about their org - feel like it can bring decent value to the partners
- Requirements to be a sponsor
    - they need to put our logo on their partners webpage
    - we get one tweet mention from their business account
- How do we vet partners?
    - Create a process with the partnerships wg
        - they must be values aligned and vision aligned and we must like the team
- What do we call these orgs?
    - Kevin Shane (Champion) suggested that ‚Äúsponsor‚Äù has too much of a connotation with being transactional. ‚ÄúPartner‚Äù sounds better and fits better, because we want to partner with orgs that not only have money to give, but whose missions we align with and whose team we like.
    - Madhav: Dream Partners - because they share our dream and vision of genZ in web3.
- Do sponsorships even need to be tied to Seasons?
