# How do we acknowledge their contribution?

Status: Addressed
Response: Karl: Maybe these can help us acknowledge the same-
1️⃣ Developing the self-conflict resolution come reflection toolkit
2️⃣ Reviewing the responses in the form for DreamerZ
3️⃣ Following up with people who need assistance beyond the scope of the toolkit

Monetarily quantifying this would involve the DAO Council to recognise the above mentioned contributions and pay ETH accordingly
