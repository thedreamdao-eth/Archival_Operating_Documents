# Types of Conflicts

## Task Conflict

**Meaning**

Task conflict, often involves concrete issues related to employees’ work assignments and can include disputes about how to divide up resources, differences of opinion on procedures and policies, [managing expectations at work](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/conflict-resolution/how-to-manage-conflict-at-work/), and judgments and interpretation of facts.

**Rationale behind solution**

Task conflict often benefits from the intervention of an organization’s leaders. This can be done through active listening, which involves asking questions, repeating back what you hear to confirm your understanding, and asking even deeper questions aimed at probing for deeper concerns. 
Try to engage the parties in a collaborative problem-solving process in which they brainstorm possible solutions. ***When parties develop solutions together, rather than having an outcome imposed on them***, they are more likely to abide by the agreement and get along better in the future.
As it still can be addressed without interventions, the “Conflict Resolution & Reflection Toolkit for the Self” should be set up
Thus the DAO Council Members should step in this domain of conflict

## Relationship Conflict

**Meaning**

Relationship conflict, arises from differences in personality, style, matters of taste, and even conflict styles. In organizations, people who would not ordinarily meet in real life are often thrown together and must try to get along. It’s no surprise, then, that relationship conflict can be common in organizations.

**Rationale behind solution**

Without intervention, it involves bringing up the source of the tension and focus on listening to the other person’s point of view. When one demonstrates empathy and interest, he or she is likely to reciprocate.
Thus the “Conflict Resolution & Reflection Toolkit for the Self” should be set up

If the conflict persists or worsens, as this conflict is less operational based, we need to set up a Council of three neutral champions at the beginning of each season. More details are available [here](The%20Conflict%20Resolution%20Council%20(CRC)%20c4d8f09a1c014e66a81c89d47c64f552.md)

## Status Conflict

**Meaning**

Status conflict is a disagreement on where you fit within a social hierarchy. These are not formal hierarchies, but our perceptions of where we sit compared to our peers. Though this might sound degen, but each organisation has a formal and informal level of centralisation-decentralisation balance.

**Rationale behind solution**

Work relations need to be made clearer, as clarity is sufficient in preventing this to become a relationship conflict. Because status conflict can feel personal, openly discussing each other’s positive attributes may remind each party of the things they like about the other person. These conversations can also give employees the tools to avoid status conflict in the future by bringing up their feelings before it impacts their work.
Thus the “Conflict Resolution & Reflection Toolkit for the Self” should be set up so that members are encouraged to approach personally, initially.

If the conflict persists or worsens, as this conflict is less operational based and more clarity based, we should again set the council up for the same!
