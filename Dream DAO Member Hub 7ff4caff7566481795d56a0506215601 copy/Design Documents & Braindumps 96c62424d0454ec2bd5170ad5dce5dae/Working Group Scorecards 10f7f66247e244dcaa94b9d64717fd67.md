- ***How does it work?***
    
    Each scorecard is filled out monthly by the two co-stewards.
    
    The scorecard covers four areas:
    
    **Operations:** Is the group meeting regularly? Sharing updates?
    
    **OKR Progress:** Is the group making progress on its OKRs?
    
    **Accomplishments:** 1-2 key accomplishments
    
    **Improvement Areas:** 1-2 improvement opportunities
    
    The scorecard is shared with the working group lead first for discussion and co-creation of **Recommendations** for next steps.
    
    Once the scorecards are finalized with all working group leads, they are shared with the rest of the DAO.
