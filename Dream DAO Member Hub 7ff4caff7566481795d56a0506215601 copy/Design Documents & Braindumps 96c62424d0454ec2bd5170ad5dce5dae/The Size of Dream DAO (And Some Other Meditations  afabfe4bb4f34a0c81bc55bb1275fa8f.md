We had a Champion‚Äôs only jam today (which was awesome), and we talked a lot about the ideal size of Dream DAO at any given time.

Which inspired the following questions:

- How many voting members (or core contributors) should we have at any given time?
- How long do we generally want or welcome members serving in roles of responsibility?
- How many members should we add at the beginning of Season 2?
- How do we make sure these members are onboarded in a way that allows them to succeed in the DAO?
- Also, what even is success?

**How many voting members (or core contributors) should we have at any given time?**

Carl brought up the fact that the difference between 40 active members and 80 is MASSIVE.

On that note, I don‚Äôt think there should be more than like 30 Builders that are expecting a lot of support at any given time.

And on that note, I think we should really encourage Builders to off-board and turn into Dream DAO alumni if they don‚Äôt think that they have time to contribute.

**How long do we generally want or welcome members serving in roles of responsibility?**

Dream DAO, to me, should be a launchpad for a regen Gen Z‚Äôs web3 career. It should not be your primary place of web3 payment/employment/responsibility for more than a season or two.

If after a year of contributing to Dream DAO, you still cannot find a suitable external DAO/project to contribute to, we‚Äôve either failed or web3 might not be something that makes sense for you at this time.

Also, we need to be enabling new young people to be taking up paid leadership opportunities. As you gain experience, you can then increasingly play a Champion role.

**How many members should we add at the beginning of Season 2?**

Equal parts Champion and Builder again.

And I think we should feel comfortable and justified in onboarding no more than like 30 new Builders to the community, who we‚Äôve really pushed to demonstrate that they will show up to things.

How do they demonstrate that they will show up for our community? By literally showing up to one or more events. That can be a big part how we pick between similarly ‚Äúqualified‚Äù candidates. Asking them to show no tell.

**How do we make sure these members are onboarded in a way that allows them to succeed in the DAO?**

We definitely need to do at least one dedicated onboarding session with them. We will probably need to do multiple to accommodate availability and timezone.

**Also, what even is success?**

Something like‚Ä¶

- Feeling confident about being able to contribute to web3
- Landing and succeeding at an external contributor role
- Making lots of friends in web3
- Increasingly understanding you-shaped holes in web3
- Challenging web3‚Äôs drawbacks/blind spots in constructive ways ‚Äî not blind followers
