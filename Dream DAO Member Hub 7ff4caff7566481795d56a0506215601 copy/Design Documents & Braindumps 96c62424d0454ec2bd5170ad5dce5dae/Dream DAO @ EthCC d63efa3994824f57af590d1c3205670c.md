Dream DAO is interested in flying out a few Builders to Paris for three days that coincide with EthCC (Ethereum’s conference in Paris - July 19-21, 2022).

**PLEASE READ BELOW BEFORE FILLING OUT THE FORM:**

**We will be selecting at least 6 Builders to join us for this trip.**

- We will be prioritizing NON-US citizens (who are legally allowed to travel to Paris)
- We will be allowing Builders who are 15, 16, or 17 years old if they get express consent from parents to travel

**Other info about the trip.**

- CU / Dream DAO will be hosting at least one event. Probably a big dinner with reps from partner orgs invite.
- You will be staying at the following hotel for three nights (Nights of July 18, July 19, July 20): **TBD**
- You will check out of the hotel in the AM of July 21st. The default is for you to have a flight out that evening.
- If you would like to stay longer—by getting to Paris earlier and/or leaving later—you need to find and pay for your own lodging. Dream DAO will still cover a departure and return flight though.
- Safder Raza + TBD will be your main points of contact during this trip. They will be organized a detailed agenda.
- Your flight and hotel cost will be covered. Dream DAO will book your flight for you.
- Hotel rooms will be assigned two people a room—we will coordinate with you to find a compatible roommate.
