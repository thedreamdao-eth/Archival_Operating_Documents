# Season Retrospective

Roles involved: Builder, CU Members, Champion, Friend of DAO, HODLer
Consolation: POAPs
Frequency: Monthly
Operation Style: Council-organized, Systemized top-down
Purpose for stakeholders: This helps us understand how the Season went, what we can do better, what we might want to do in the next Season, etc
did we do it in Phase 1?: Yes

# Rationale

# Frequency

Twice a season

Generally Friday/ Saturday is preferred (ideal time for most time zone concerns and work commitments)

Preferably Morning and Evening EDT Timings are scheduled in General

# What roles have access to this space and why?

All roles

Keeping it open has following benefits-

1. Gives the roles designed to plug in less get a glimpse of the DAO space regardless of their roles
2. Non Voters , especially Friends get a glimpse of the same and get a social and mental push to know more in general (this depends on their interests and the way it would intertwine with the concerning DAO, provided they have a third person feedback on how they feel things are working in the DAO)
