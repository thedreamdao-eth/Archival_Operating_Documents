# Working Group Meetings

Roles involved: Builder, Champion
Consolation: POAPs
Frequency: Once a week
Operation Style: Inter-role organised
Purpose for stakeholders: This helps working group members get on the same page about things and jam on items (that might not make sense to bring to a DAO-wide jam) and assign next steps etc
did we do it in Phase 1?: Yes

# Rationale

# Frequency

A call per week

Groups can have subgroupn calls depending on their necessity, but need to have at least one 30 minute call throughout the week

# What roles have access to this space and why?

All roles and we can bring +1s to the event

Keeping it open has following benefits-

1. Gives the roles designed to plug in less get a glimpse of the DAO space regardless of their roles
2. +1s get a glimpse of the same and get a social and mental push to know more in general (this depends on their interests and the way it would intertwine with the concerning DAO
