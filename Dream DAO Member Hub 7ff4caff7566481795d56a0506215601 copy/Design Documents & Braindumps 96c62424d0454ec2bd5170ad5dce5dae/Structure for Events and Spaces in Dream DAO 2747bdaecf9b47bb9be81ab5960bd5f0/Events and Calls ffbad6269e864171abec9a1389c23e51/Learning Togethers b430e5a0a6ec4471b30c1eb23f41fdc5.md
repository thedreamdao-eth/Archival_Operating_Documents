# Explanation & Rationale

Learning Together sessions are educational one-hour meetings generally designed to give community members insight into a specific aspect of web3, the blockchain, personal growth, or relevant topics.  These sessions are hosted once or twice a week by professionals in the web3 space.  A common LT format involves icebreakers at the beginning, a lecture, a Q&A period, and a reflection.  This allows for a productive but concise meeting.

- Oliver: Best LTs were the ones where we collaborated + Discussed things more

# Frequency

2 Spaces a week that generally follow the timing below:

- Weekday evenings EST
- Saturday mornings EST

This splits the timing for people in different time zones as well.

# What roles have access to this space and why?

All roles are allowed, and we can bring +1s to the event.

Keeping it open has following benefits-

1. Allows the roles that are designed to plug in less to get a glimpse of the DAO space regardless of their duties.
2. +1s get a glimpse of the same and get a social and mental push to know more in general (this depends on their interests and the way it would intertwine with the concerning DAO).
