# What are the requirements to be and stay in the Explorers Program?

- Filled out all 5 weeks of weekly check-ins

To be in the program in the first place:

- You must be contributing 10 or more hours a week to approved web3 organizations outside of Dream DAO.
- You must be approved by Steward to be an Explorer after applying and submitting proof that you will be contributing as noted above.
    - *Track record of positive contributions to working groups / other DAO activities are the main way that you prove your readiness for Explorers Program*
- **Message me by Tuesday, June 7th at 5pm ET if you no longer want to participate. All decisions are final.**

Reminder:

- To be EXCITED! This is a great opportunity.

To maintain your status in the program:

- **You need to fill out a [Weekly Check-In form](https://ddepcheckins.paperform.co/) every week**
    - Don’t see this as a chore, see it as a way to help you plan and get help with what you’re doing
- **To receive the first support payment ($750) - which will be delivered half-way into the program (after 5 weeks), you need to have…**
    - Come to 2 or more Junto meetings (which will happen most weeks, usually alternating between Wednesday at 7:30pm ET and Wednesday at 10am ET)
    - Published your first “Learning Artifact” (a tweet thread, blog post, or vlog) distilling your top 5 or more lessons from your experience so far (you can also suggest a different idea if you’re willing to argue why you’re deviating from the default). You must tag Dream DAO and mention the Explorers Program.
        - One fellow Explorer needs to have co-signed your Learning Artifact (this is a quality test)
- **To receive the second support payment ($750) - which will be delivered at the end of the program (after 10 weeks), you need to have…**
    - Filled out all 5 more weeks of weekly check-ins
    - Come to 2 or more additional Junto meetings (which will happen most weeks, usually alternating between Wednesday at 7:30pm ET and Wednesday at 10am ET)
    - Published your second “Learning Artifact” (a tweet thread, blog post, or vlog). This should be about your host site and the work you did this summer. You must tag Dream DAO and mention the Explorers Program.
        - One fellow Explorer needs to have co-signed your Learning Artifact (this is a quality test)
    - Collectively as an Explorers Program cohort create an event that celebrates the work the Explorers did and distills their top insights from the program.
