### The Gist

***What is the thing you are designing?***

- The flagship program of the [Dream DAO](https://nutshell.dreamdao.xyz)
- During the program, ~10-15 Founding Dream DAO Builders will...
    1. explore and contribute to regen web3 (10 hrs a week total on average at minimum)
        1. if they cannot find a single place that can host them for 10+ hours a week for 10 weeks, they will contribute to at least two regen web3 organizations that theoretically suit their interests + skillsets that accumulate to over 10+ hours a week.
    2. create at least two polished ‚ÄúLearning Artifacts‚Äù (e.g. blog posts, vlogs, Learning Together Sessions) for the world‚Äîone at the midpoint of the program and one at the end
    3. participate in weekly Juntos (of 4-5 other Explorers and 2 Champions)
    4. collectively as an Explorers Program cohort create an event that celebrates the work the Explorers did and distills their top insights from the program
- There is a $750 payment at the middle mark if they hit all the milestones. And another $750 at the end if they hit the final milestones. See [here](Proposed%20Explorers%20Program%20Evolution%20a253a68a7fc942d6adcbde36074a2d5d.md) for details.

***What are the ultimate objectives?***

- Advance web3 x social impact by empowering Dream DAO Builders to contribute to the missions of impactful web3 x social impact organizations
- Explorers contribute to the collective intelligence/knowledge of the Dream DAO, web3, and the world
- Greatly elevate the brand of Dream DAO and the inbound from potential funders and talented Gen Zers
- Help the Dream DAO Explorers advance their skillsets, profiles, and careers in web3

### Background

---

- Powered by¬†[Civics Unplugged](https://www.civicsunplugged.org/), the [Dream DAO](https://dreamdao.xyz/) is a DAO ([decentralized autonomous organization](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o)) that invests in the future of the web3 x social impact ecosystem by providing diverse Gen Zers around the globe with the training, funding, and mentorship they need to leverage the power of web3 to secure a brighter future for humanity. Learn more about Dream DAO here: [https://nutshell.dreamdao.xyz](https://nutshell.dreamdao.xyz/)
- It‚Äôs very hard to start contributing to a cool web3 org as a teen in web3 if you don‚Äôt have a warm introduction to a web3 organization and you don‚Äôt have prior web3 work experience
- There are way more web3 x social impact organizations in March 2022 than there were in the year prior; the time is right to launch this program
- The best way to learn web3 is not to simply read/consume lectures about web3. It‚Äôs to actually get involved.

### About the Dream DAO ‚ÄúExplorers‚Äù (the Gen Zers we want to start contributing to regen web3)

---

**Web3 is an ever-growing space where new breakthroughs happen every day because of the ambitious ideas of the community. This is a space of initiative, and initiative requires an adventurous spirit, courage, and modern vision. The younger generation embodies these attributes and provides an optimistic, creative outlook towards society.** 

*But how do we get young people who have the motivation, skills, and bandwidth to help us build the web3 space?*

Dream DAO Explorers are young civic-minded builders who have shown their commitment towards making a change by starting campaigns, organizations and initiatives. The Builders are hand-selected by the Dream DAO community after deliberation and discourse.

They are supported by our Dream DAO ‚ÄúChampions,‚Äù who are experts in adjacent fields and provide the wisdom and values for success.

- They have shown evidence of their work ethic, ability to execute, and sharpness of thinking.
- For being part of the program, they expressed interest and commitment to make an impact.

Our builders are already doing great things in different disciplines. Some of our Builders are part of the Gitcoin DAO and work in the public goods space, while others are helping their local communities by educating them about web3.  They are a diverse group of individuals who have different thought processes, which is their superpower and allows them to see across the landscape and incorporate different views and mindsets.
