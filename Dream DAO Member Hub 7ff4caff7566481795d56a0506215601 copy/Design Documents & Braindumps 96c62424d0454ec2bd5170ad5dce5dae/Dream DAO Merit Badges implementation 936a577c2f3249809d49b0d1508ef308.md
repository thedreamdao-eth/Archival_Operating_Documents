# The Plan

Merit badges will be on chain tokens in the form of nfts as [erc 1155 tokens](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) on the polygon mainnet. They will be minted directly into the recipient wallets from single wallet to maintain the traceability and verifiability of the merit badges. 

Over the month folks who are to receive any type of merit badges are selected and at the end of the month nfts are minted through [Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) to the wallets. 

Here is a detailed explanation how anyone can mint an nft through thirweb
