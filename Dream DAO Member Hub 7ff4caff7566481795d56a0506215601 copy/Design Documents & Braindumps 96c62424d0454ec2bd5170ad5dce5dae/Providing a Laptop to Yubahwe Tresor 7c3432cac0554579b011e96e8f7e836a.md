## Background

[Yubahwe Tresor](https://twitter.com/YubahweTresor) is an 18-year-old season 2 builder from Huye, Rwanda. She is the founder of Here for You, a CU-supported reproductive justice project launched at Runga primary school in the south of Rwanda. With total funding exceeding over 800 dollars, the project intends to support the education of girls by helping them encounter challenges that hinder their education. Such challenges include early pregnancies and a lack of hygienic materials like sanitary pads. The Here for You project has started a Girls Club where all girls in that school will be gathered each Wednesday to be taught about reproductive health. Here for You is working with the Rwandan Minister of Education to host professionals, doctors, and youth counsellors to teach those teenagers on a monthly basis.

With a substantial footprint in Social Impact, Yubahwe applied for becoming a Dream DAO builder with hopes of learning, passing down, and implementing the basics of web3 in her hometown. For meeting the application requirement, she joined a  Dream DAO community hangout using the school‚Äôs laptop. But due to poor network connections, she was unable to attend further sessions.

She got selected for a program called [Bridge to Rwanda](https://www.bridge2rwanda.org/), a competitive programme that selects competent students across East Africa for getting an overseas education beyond high school. While the program helps in funding for testing, accommodation, tuition and mentorship, the students are expected to have a laptop for attending the program. Yubahwe had been previously accepted, but couldn‚Äôt attend because her family could not afford a laptop. She has been accepted this year, but still has no access to a laptop.

**As Dream DAO provides the funding for Gen-Zers to leverage their roles at the intersection of Web3 and Social Impact, getting funding/ buying a laptop for Yubahwe will not only help her set up a wallet and have better access to the Dream DAO community but also help her secure the much-needed mentorship for a quality higher education experience.**

## In a nutshell

We wish to provide Yubahwe with a laptop. As Yubahwe will be in Kigali for the programme, the laptop can be shipped to/bought in Kigali. For questions, she is reachable on WhatsApp, as her discord is on the school laptop, at +250-790227775.

Note- Her family can bear network connection costs post-October, while in Kigali where she is currently, she has decent Wi-Fi access. It will be very helpful for her to get the laptop in about a week from the proposal‚Äôs approval as this will help in onboarding to the Dream DAO community as well as for the B2R Scholars Program.
