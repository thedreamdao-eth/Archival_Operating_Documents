In any community, decisions have to be made about how the community operates.

Let’s call these decisions “agreements.”

This is one of them.

How do we develop these agreements?

First, it’s important to know that we struggled with this for the first Season of Dream DAO.

- We had no defined protocol, so that itself was an issue;
- Some ideas were floated via email, others in Discord; What “approved” meant was not clear;
- No clear “Source of Truth” about where to learn how Dream DAO operates
- Members were not finding out about [potential] agreements—or finding out too late to properly weigh in before a Snapshot vote on the agreement

Thus, we decided the following:

- We are going to batch potential agreements in a weekly **“Call for Comments” Monday email.**
    - This is where Adarsh sends out all the [already-sanity-checked ideas](A%20New%20Agreements%20Process%20(shifting%20away%20from%20Murmu%20f71f4ed7d0be4111ba5e22ed29f8fead.md) that have been turned into [draft agreements](A%20New%20Agreements%20Process%20(shifting%20away%20from%20Murmu%20f71f4ed7d0be4111ba5e22ed29f8fead.md) (this very Notion document is an example of one)
- Then on Fridays, we are going to send out a weekly “Call for Votes” Friday email.
    - This is where Adarsh calls for the community to vote on the draft agreements which have been iterated on between Monday and Thursday. Each draft agreement will have been linked to its own Snapshot proposal.
- Altogether, the Monday and Friday email schedule increases community engagement by giving people a predictable schedule for reviewing/voting on ideas.
- If a draft agreement receives majority “Yes” votes then it will be promoted to [Community-Approved Agreements](../Community-Approved%20Agreements%208a69d0fe98644312a618f9f7dbd985a2.md).
    - Part of the benefit of Murmur was having all of our passed proposals in one place in an organized way. This serves the same purpose.

## Here’s How To Produce An Agreement:

1. Braindump on the agreement idea
    - Braindump = documentation of rough, mostly unfiltered thinking about a topic. This is not the time to worry too much about formatting.
2. Get 2-3 Dream DAO members to weigh in on the braindump (”initial sanity check”)
    - You could do this all async, but agreements that could really affect the experience of members should be discussed during synchronous jams too
3. If people like the idea enough, create a draft agreement that is meant to eventually be promoted as a “source of truth” document in the [Community-Approved Agreements](../Community-Approved%20Agreements%208a69d0fe98644312a618f9f7dbd985a2.md) hub
4. Send this draft agreement to the #draft-agreements channel, noting that it’s ready to be sent out in the next Monday “Call for Comments” email (which goes out to the whole community).
5. Based on feedback from the community, either integrate the feedback and move forward with a Snapshot vote or decide to pull the draft agreement (if you do this, make sure to mention this in the #draft-agreements channel)
6. If you decided to move forward with a Snapshot vote, it will go out in the Friday “Call for Votes” email
7. Three days later you will know if your draft agreement was approved or denied by the community.
8. If it was approved, Adarsh will move the agreement’s Notion page from [](../Design%20Documents%20&%20Braindumps%2096c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae.md) to [Community-Approved Agreements](../Community-Approved%20Agreements%208a69d0fe98644312a618f9f7dbd985a2.md)
