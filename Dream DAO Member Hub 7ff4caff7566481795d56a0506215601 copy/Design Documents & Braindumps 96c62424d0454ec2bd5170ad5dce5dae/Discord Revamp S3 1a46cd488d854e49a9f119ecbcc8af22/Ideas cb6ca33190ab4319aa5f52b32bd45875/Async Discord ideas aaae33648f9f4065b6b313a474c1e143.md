# Async Discord ideas

<aside>
ℹ️ Feel free to drop your ideas of what to delete/add/change/etc as bullets below!

</aside>

❗**New:**

- 

**⏩Later down the line:**

- Strict moderators + removing advertisement
    - Clear boundaries (matched in rules)
    - Set script to send
    - Removal of unneeded posts, sending script - dealt with kindly but effectively
    - Redirect content or not appropriate Discord wide
- Have a ticket for “potential partners”; people that join and are interested in collaborating with us can easily get a ticket and be connected to someone from Grants/Co-stewards
    - Why is this needed if our onboarding coordinator can just direct an interested person to the co-stew/grants?
- use discord forum option for a news/learning resources channel; I think the same could be done for the opportunities channel, and maybe for announcements
    - Maybe a channel for posting one Web3 fact a day or a daily piece of news related to web3
- polls channel to keep friends engaged (maybe across solarpunk? I know we don’t have solarpunk discussion anymore, so something more simple would be cool)
    - How about qotd (question of the day channel?). Questions will be on a refi topic + is easier than setting up polls
- Specific roles, e.g. S2 vs S3 Builder tags
    - Why is this needed?

✅ **Implemented:**

- Add a verification channel with a no-login captcha bot like Vulcan
- Add an official links channel to accomodate our public links for visitors
- Delete/Archive the lounge chat bc the built-in chat of the voice channel works just fine
- Change the look of the channels into a more clean one “**✅｜verify**” (looks cool on the server
- Community jamouts to be deleted
- Oliver: As I had in my document on Discord, I think one of the biggest things is hearing from community members on what they want to use Discord for and what about the Discord now makes things difficult. Asking these why questions for the design is important so we can determine what really needs to be included on Discord. Personally, I feel with Discord minimal is better as it quickly becomes overwhelming and harder to navigate.
    - *Question already asked in the community health survey.*
        - Ibtehaj is following up with Arath on the results.
- Oliver: Also, from Ash Kranti, perhaps having some drop-in or office hour type calls would be helpful for the revamp. I think a good model could be a call for the team to work on edits where any community member can jump in and see progress or offer their own perspective.
    - Can try plan next week’s calls like this, but the ones this week were also free for anybody to hop-in
- **Create roles for Co-Stewards and recurring roles**
- Update roles in the discord server for builders
- Have an intros channel for public
- Explanation/Guide to the different roles and channels you can get
- Have just one public “general-chat” channel to encourage cross-role communication (public, friends, members)
- Have a channel for recurring roles + WG Leads + co-stews to communicate - check in with Harry or DM group
    - Better to have a DM group
- Move SkywalkerZ to public and encourage HODLers to share their NFTs to encourage visitors to buy!
