ℹ️ Note from Gary:

Objective is to introduce a new voting member of the dream dao to:
1) member of the dream dao / people in the discord
2) people on social media

Voting members are listed [here](../Evergreen%20Documents%20976d2984e99f4146b4283457a2303a7c/Evergreen%20Documents%20Database%20db1ccc6322ae474dba4b59d6b687d080/Dream%20DAO%20Founding%20Voting%20Member%20Database%20Director%20353cd716a7f64dbc95acae74e661dbf4.md).

HOW you introduce people is the open question Shreya + Arman are figuring out.

What in their application (which should be in their row of the voting member table) do you feature? 

Do you ask for a picture that we can turn into an astronaut? 

Do we feature their SkywalkerZ?

Do we ask for a new quote?

Do we ask a question that is fun / casual to feature?

Please design this process of featuring a new member a day.

# Introducing the people

### HOW you introduce people is the open question

With a-

- name,
- fun fact, and
- quote
- work they do
- twitter account

### What in their application (which should be in their row of the voting member table) do you feature?

The Why of joining the DAO

### Do you ask for a picture that we can turn into an astronaut?

Only if it is cheaper to get such a picture (Arman is really frugal abt stuff)

### Do we feature their SkywalkerZ?

Absolutely!

### Do we ask for a new quote?

Yes

### Do we ask a question that is fun / casual to feature?

Yes, that’s how we introduce the person haha

### Please design this process of featuring a new member a day.

1. Form + Integration with the Intro-club to be the source of the database
2. We first get to know the DreamerZ on the server by using data from the from and prepare a database for them
3. Then keep the Freelancer Artists updated on the assignments we need (assuming it is cheap, we are getting frugal here)
4. Present a person from the database into  
5. Use the database created to keep 6-7 people onboarded on it weekly.
