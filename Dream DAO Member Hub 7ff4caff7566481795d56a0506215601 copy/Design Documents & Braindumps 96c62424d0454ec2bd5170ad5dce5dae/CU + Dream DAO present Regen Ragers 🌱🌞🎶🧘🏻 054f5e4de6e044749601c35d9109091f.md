## OVERVIEW

At [Civics Unplugged](https://www.civicsunplugged.org) / [Dream DAO](https://dreamdao.xyz/), we are launching a Summer 2022 event series at our office called “Regen Ragers" for the amazing future-builders in NYC (and those visiting NYC 🗽)

We want to create a recurring time and space for regen-minded builders of many kinds to:

1. have a go to place to meet and eat plant-based food with amazing values-aligned people who could be collaborators 🥗🫂,
2. listen and vibe to feel-good music 🎉🎶, and
3. RELAX after working so hard during the week 🧘🏻🌱

AND of course… we want you to meet the amazing friends, partners, supporters, and team members of Civics Unplugged / Dream DAO—all while getting to explore the world-class solarpunk-vibes coworking + community space that the Company team has built 🤗🌇

[Company](http://company.co/) is a curated community of NYC’s top startups, entrepreneurs, and enterprises located right next to the legendary Grand Central Station.

These events would likely take place on a Friday or Saturday.
