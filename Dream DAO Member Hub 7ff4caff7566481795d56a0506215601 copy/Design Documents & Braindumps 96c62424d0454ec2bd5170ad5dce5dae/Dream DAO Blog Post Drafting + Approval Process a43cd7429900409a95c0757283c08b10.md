Status: First draft completed
Document creator: Gary Sheng
Contributor(s): Gary Sheng, Madhav, Arman/Karl :), Timofei Dort-Golts, Vedanth Rohit, Saf

1. Writers submit their blog/writing to the [#dream-dao-blog](https://discord.com/channels/896096170621947974/955939922299215924) channel
2. A thread is created fo reviewing the blog.
3. A Champion raises their hand to edit the blog post (if we run into problems of the same Champion always doing this, we can limit how many edits someone can do per week/month).
4. The Champion who has stepped up as the post editor suggests edits (both content and copy edits - editing shouldn't just be fixing grammar/punctuation). They can incorporate any other comments from the thread (but only if they want to). Writer fixes them and resubmits to same editor
5. Once both writer and editor are happy with the final version, people who care to vote in the [#dream-dao-blog](https://discord.com/channels/896096170621947974/955939922299215924) channel emoji vote on whether it should get published. No more edits/suggestions at this stage - the goal shouldn't be to make sure everyone thinks it's perfect (too hard and frustrating as a writer).
6. If vote passes, piece gets published. Writer gets paid but also editor ($100 for writer and $50 for editor).
