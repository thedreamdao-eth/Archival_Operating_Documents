What happens when a coordinator wishes to go on a vacation/ take a break?,"It is more than better to unplug from responsibilities! Regardless of when and of what duration their break is, coordinators are recommended to share the same in #wellness-and-unplugging. As the coordinators are initially in tune with the contributions made by people by themselves / as a team, they can either:

1) Either nominate someone to lead interim

        ▪ In this case, the break can range from three days to three weeks.
            • The concerned member is recommended to message in Wellness and Unplugging about their break
        ▪ They subsequently notify about them for the responsibilities for the duration
        ▪ The Interim lead can take Council’s assistance for working on certain responsibilities/ challenges for the working group.
        ▪ Once the initial lead is back, the interim lead briefs them abt what has happened since their leave, asks them to read the Dream Journal/ Get on a call/ have a discord chat with someone in the dream DAO Council for cross working group and overall updates

2) Ask the DAO Council to hold a small election to pick the lead for the rest of the Season (if the coordinator wishes to step down / needs to take a break longer than 3 weeks)

        ▪ It is recommended to notify the council and the respective working group at least 3-4 days prior if elections are to be held
        ▪ The DAO Council subsequently takes 24-ish hours to get in candidates for the interim post, and set up a Snapshot vote for the concerned working group (or just a good ol’ Discord Reaction poll), for 2-3 working days.
        ▪ (PS: All of this is happening before the coordinator has scheduled to take a leave, lest they leave without giving a notice, what do we do here? (please comment!))
        ▪ Before/after someone is elected, the initial coordinator notifies the group + the new lead about the planned responsibilities for the coming times and takes a leave
        ▪ The new lead can take Council’s assistance for working on certain responsibilities/ challenges for the working group."
Who a coordinator is NOT?,"1) A coordinator isn’t one who is involved in all or a lot of actions in their working group
    ◦ The coordinators just need to be observant and are strictly not recommended to be involved in a lot of the tasks of their working group.

        ▪ Here’s where the Dream DAO Council or the Members can be vigilant about
        ▪ If this is not adhered, they’ll be given a warning the first time, and would need to consult with the Council to reconcile, if not the WG will nominate a new WG coordinator

2) As long as the actions and contributions of the members of the group comply to the builder + champion principles and not involve confusion of direction (like people individually working on the same thing async), actions in the concerned working group need no involvement or “approval” by the coordinator

3) A coordinator isn’t one who has disrespected the coordinator ethics and principles

4) Members of the working group will have the chance to fill out the working group coordinator feedback form on a monthly basis!"
