# Who a coordinator is NOT?

Column 1: 1) A coordinator isn’t one who is involved in all or a lot of actions in their working group
    ◦ The coordinators just need to be observant and are strictly not recommended to be involved in a lot of the tasks of their working group.

        ▪ Here’s where the Dream DAO Council or the Members can be vigilant about
        ▪ If this is not adhered, they’ll be given a warning the first time, and would need to consult with the Council to reconcile, if not the WG will nominate a new WG coordinator

2) As long as the actions and contributions of the members of the group comply to the builder + champion principles and not involve confusion of direction (like people individually working on the same thing async), actions in the concerned working group need no involvement or “approval” by the coordinator

3) A coordinator isn’t one who has disrespected the coordinator ethics and principles

4) Members of the working group will have the chance to fill out the working group coordinator feedback form on a monthly basis!
