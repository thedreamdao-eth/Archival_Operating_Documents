# What happens when a coordinator wishes to go on a vacation/ take a break?

Column 1: It is more than better to unplug from responsibilities! Regardless of when and of what duration their break is, coordinators are recommended to share the same in #wellness-and-unplugging. As the coordinators are initially in tune with the contributions made by people by themselves / as a team, they can either:

1) Either nominate someone to lead interim

        ▪ In this case, the break can range from three days to three weeks.
            • The concerned member is recommended to message in Wellness and Unplugging about their break
        ▪ They subsequently notify about them for the responsibilities for the duration
        ▪ The Interim lead can take Council’s assistance for working on certain responsibilities/ challenges for the working group.
        ▪ Once the initial lead is back, the interim lead briefs them abt what has happened since their leave, asks them to read the Dream Journal/ Get on a call/ have a discord chat with someone in the dream DAO Council for cross working group and overall updates

2) Ask the DAO Council to hold a small election to pick the lead for the rest of the Season (if the coordinator wishes to step down / needs to take a break longer than 3 weeks)

        ▪ It is recommended to notify the council and the respective working group at least 3-4 days prior if elections are to be held
        ▪ The DAO Council subsequently takes 24-ish hours to get in candidates for the interim post, and set up a Snapshot vote for the concerned working group (or just a good ol’ Discord Reaction poll), for 2-3 working days.
        ▪ (PS: All of this is happening before the coordinator has scheduled to take a leave, lest they leave without giving a notice, what do we do here? (please comment!))
        ▪ Before/after someone is elected, the initial coordinator notifies the group + the new lead about the planned responsibilities for the coming times and takes a leave
        ▪ The new lead can take Council’s assistance for working on certain responsibilities/ challenges for the working group.
