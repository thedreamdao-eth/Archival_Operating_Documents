Hi!

This is a quick brain dump of two separate thoughts:

**1) Treasury**

As Iâ€™ve been applying for grants, Iâ€™m realizing that grant giving institutions (and most importantly human psychology) makes it very hard for grant givers to want to give an excess amount of funding such that we can invest the excess funding like an endowment (like a college does).

For example, if a grant giver knows we need $100k for Season 2, they are almost certainly not going to give more than $100k. In fact, they will usually ask to cover only a piece of Season 2 budget.

On that note, I wonder if itâ€™s a moot point to try to over-plan endowment strategy. Iâ€™m happy to be proven wrong that people are willing to give us way more money than we need for our budget, but I havenâ€™t seen that prove out in the three years of helping run CU and 4 months of Dream DAO.

**2) DAO Tools**

I feel like itâ€™s time to put a moratorium (a stop) on exploring new DAO tools. We havenâ€™t tried Clarity for example in a serious way, and before exploring more bounty tools and other tools, we should just focus on the tools we are already committed to experimenting with.

Thoughts?
