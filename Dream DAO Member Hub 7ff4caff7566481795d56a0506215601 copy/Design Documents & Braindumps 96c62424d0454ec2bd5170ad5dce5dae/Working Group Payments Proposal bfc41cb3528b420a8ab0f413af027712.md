Right now, we pay our working group leads through fixed monthly stipends. The stipend is currently $750 a month. **There have been instances of people reporting feeling underpaid because of their stipend not matching the number of hours they work every week. Additionally, we recently converted our [recurring role payments to hourly](https://www.notion.so/Paying-Recurring-Roles-bb7da01ce5c243ce852ccb4aace8008b?pvs=21), and some of our members in recurring roles have questioned why working group lead payments do not follow a similar standard.** 

In general, it is very hard to estimate how much someone is doing week to week without tracking hours. And some working groups will require more work from the lead than others. This idea proposes that instead of flat stipends: 

- We pay working group leads a base stipend of $250 a month. This should cover weekly, recurring work of prepping meetings/tasks and hosting meetings (including the once per month DAO council meeting)
- For work that goes beyond these recurring tasks of prepping and hosting meetings, working group leads a rate of $17 USD/hour as a standard. Work such as deciding new goals for the working group, setting up tasks, and completing tasks for the working group.
- If people feel like they should be paid more for their hourly rate, they can create a proposal for a DAO-wide vote. (It can also be proposed on behalf of another person, like if a Co-Steward or voting member believes someone deserves a higher rate.)

To not create perverse incentives, we will inform leads that they are not able to take on bounties that they would have previously given to members in order to increase their hours. Bounties should always go to wg members- unless no one wants to or the work is too high-context (like Ethan setting up the CRM). Members can also propose their own bounties. 

Overallâ€” this makes compensation more fair and standardized (across working groups and recurring roles). These sorts of systems, as opposed to subjective estimations, are essential for us to continue legitimatizing and decentralizing the DAO.
