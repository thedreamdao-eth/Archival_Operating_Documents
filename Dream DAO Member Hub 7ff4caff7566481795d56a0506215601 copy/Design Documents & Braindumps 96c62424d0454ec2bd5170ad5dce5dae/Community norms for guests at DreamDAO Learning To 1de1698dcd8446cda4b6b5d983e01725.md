ðŸ‘‹ Â Hi! Thank you for coming here and your interest in joining one of our Learning Together sessions!

### Basics

The [Dream DAO](https://dreamdao.xyz/) is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization building a web3 x social impact ecosystem for Gen Z. 

We are run primarily by Gen Zers aged 15-19 years who come from all over the world. 

We believe that one of the best investments in humanity is in us, Gen Z, the builders of the future. Our goal is to equip Gen Z Builders with the skills, knowledge, and connections to leverage the most powerful emerging technology â€” web3 â€” to build a brighter future for humanity.

### **Learning Together**

Our Learning Together sessions bring together an unlikely cast of social entrepreneurs, DAO experts, philanthropists, web3 pioneers, and young people who can greatly inform and support each other's ability to use web3 for good.

Guests are welcome to join, but we ask that you abide by our community norms and follow these ground rules so the conversation continues to be led by our Gen Z Builders:

- Join with your video off and microphone muted
- No need to participate in icebreakers or taking meetings notes in Notion
- Stay in listening mode during the main discussion, but do offer reactions, emojis, and helpful links in the chat.
- Be thoughtful about asking questions / provocations in the chat. We want to reserve this space first for Gen Z Builders, but if a visitor has an interesting and topic-related impulse, we welcome enriching additions and food for thought.
- At end, time permitting, feel free to say hi and share any reflections on the session. (You are also welcome to disappear silently and share a note with the person who invited you afterwards!)
