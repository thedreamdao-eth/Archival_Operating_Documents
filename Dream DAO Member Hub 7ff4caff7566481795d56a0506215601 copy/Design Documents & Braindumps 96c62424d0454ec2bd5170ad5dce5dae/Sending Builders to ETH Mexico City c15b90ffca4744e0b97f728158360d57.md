## Why Taking Trips Is Important

---

Aside from the incredible value trips provide to our Builders, we have a 60k grant from Celo. If 10 trips are taken by August 31st, 2022, we get ANOTHER 60k from them. We are only at about 7 trips taken so far. 

**Deliverables:**

ETH Mexico will allow Builders to network and collaborate with other folks in the space, and with Saf (chaperone)‚Äôs guidance and expertise in Gitcoin, he will have the ability to make a lot of connections at ETH Mexico with Dream DAO Builders and respectable organizations.

## Information

---

ETHMexico is one of the most significant web3 events happening in North America in 2022 with the main event from 19-21 August. There will be great speakers, talks, booths, and community spaces where builders have the opportunity to network and build relationships as ambassadors of the Dream DAO.

## Miscellaneous

A refundable deposit of 0.02 ETH is required to lock our spots in. 0.022 ETH (to account for gas fees) will be distributed to 6 members, totaling to **0.132 ETH**. ~$162USD as of 7/15/22.

We will be adding a miscellaneous fund as well to account for unexpected rises in travel costs/unexpected fees caused as a result of the volatile markets (in gas, flights, etc.) This miscellaneous fund will be $300. 

This will **not** all be used and any remainder will be refunded back to Dream DAO.

# **TOTAL TRIP COST = $5601 (which will be from the Celo grant)**
