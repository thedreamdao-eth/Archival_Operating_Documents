Hey!

My name is Gary. Happy DAOpunk owner here. I’m one of the co-founders of [Dream DAO](https://dreamdao.xyz/), a global, diverse youth-empowering community that launched in January 2022 that trains and onboards regen-minded Gen Zers to web3 so they can contribute to impact-oriented DAOs, other web3 projects, and the regen web3 space at large.

Very similarly to DAOpunks’s mission to “enable humans to liberate themselves from the soul-sucking drudgery of default world work and lead them to the rewarding, expansive freedom found in meaningful DAO work”, Dream DAO aims to unshackle talented, impact-focused Gen Zers from old world systems so they can build the new world.

We do this in three ways:

1. **FOSTERING AN EMPOWERING LEARNING COMMUNITY:** The Dream DAO cultivates an empowering, intergenerational, global community and offers a range of learning + mentorship opportunities that help young people gain confidence and experience at the intersection of web3 x social impact. The core “product” of the learning community is the “Learning Together” series, which is hosted twice a week and features a community member or guest hosting a lecture on a web3 concept and spreading the word on the Solarpunk future we envision will come with web3 x social impact. Past guest hosts have included Gitcoin founder [Kevin Owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki), renown web3 educator [Samina](https://twitter.com/saminacodes), co-founder of Constitution DAO [Graham Novak](https://twitter.com/gnovak_) and many more web3 luminaries.

2. **HELPING OUR YOUTH GET MATCHED WITH AND CONTRIBUTE TO DAOS:** The Dream DAO Explorers Program is a 2 month placement program for 15-20 year olds seeking to contribute to DAOs be and build the future of web3 x social impact. For the pilot program starting June 2022, Dream DAO Builders will be placed in web3 organizations making social impact (e.g. Gitcoin, ReFi DAO, Toucan Protocol), and will produce one knowledge artifact a month. Learn more about the program [here](Dream%20DAO%20Explorers%20Program%20-%20Design%20Doc%20(May%202022%20057b51e4dc864f68bf9fe93bf1464d2f.md).
3. **EMPOWERING OUR YOUTH TO EXPLORE WEB3 AND DAOS FOR A YEAR:** Starting in Fall 2022, a subset of the graduates of our Explorers program will be offered a larger stipend ($12,000, paid out at $1k/month for a year) as part of a program called Dream DAO Launch Year. This program is intended to enable the most promising and committed Explorers to have the financial freedom to pursue a career in web3 x social impact full-time for a year (and pave the way for far more young people to dive deep into web3 full-time).

**THE ASK:**

- We are placing 10 of our 15-20 year old members in DAOs this summer (June + July). We are requesting 4 ETH from the DAOpunks treasury to give .4 ETH to each of these 10 “Explorers.” This would cover half of the stipend that Dream DAO aims to provide each of them this summer. Examples of Explorers include [Jae-Hee](https://twitter.com/b_jaehee), [Oliver](https://twitter.com/oliveryehlik), and [Amanda](https://twitter.com/maritan_twt).
- To commemorate and announce this gift, we would write a tweet thread announcing the gift and do a Twitter Spaces with the DAOpunks team.
- After the Explorers Program ends (end of July 2022), we would also release a blog post featuring testimonials about why the gift was tremendously valuable to their development as web3 contributors.
- Dream DAO is excited to partner with DAOpunks in a number of ways medium and long term. For example, we are very open to collaborating on and supporting the creating and launch of DAOpunks v2 if that were ever in your playbook.
