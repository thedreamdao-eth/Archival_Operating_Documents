Accessible by: DreamerZ
Optional Channel?: NO
Remark: Includes the focus mode option and opt-in reaction badges that denote their bandwidth for the week

# Rationale

To check in bandwidth for a member for the given week

Hydra bot to be used

Four badges for following bandwidths- (will loop in Ash Kranti to help design the badge designs if xe can help out!)

- 1 hour a week
- 1-3 hours a week
- 3-5 hours a week
- Unplugging from work atm

This helps the working group coordinators know how much they can hold you accountable for + ensure you are not spreading your time too thin

# Touchpoints involved (peeps + documents)

Admins get to handle the bot

Members get to react to get the role

a tag will be sent every monday at 9 am EDT (and then deleted the same day) for people to set their bandwidths accordingly
