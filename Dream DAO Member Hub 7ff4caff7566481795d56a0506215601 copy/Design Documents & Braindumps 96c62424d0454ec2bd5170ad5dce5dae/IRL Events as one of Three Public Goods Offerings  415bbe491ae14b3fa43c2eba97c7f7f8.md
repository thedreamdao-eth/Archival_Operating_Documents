What are the core activities that benefit the public good that Dream DAO is or should be responsible for?

I would say these three activities or as I might call “public goods offerings”:

1. [Learning Together Sessions](../Guides%20&%20How-To%E2%80%99s%2063c1f45fab634aeaa80bf88fbf4b1c2c/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20%F0%9F%8C%9E%20-%20Overview%20506ac632cd274e0392d809956a546ccd.md): which enable regens (like SkywalkerZ hodlers) to get exposed to luminaries and ideas that are relevant to building the future of and leveraging regen web3
2. [The Explorers Program](Dream%20DAO%20Explorers%20Program%20-%20Design%20Doc%20(May%202022%20057b51e4dc864f68bf9fe93bf1464d2f.md): which enables proven, not-necessarily-technical (usually ops and community-oriented) 15-20 year olds to get experience contributing to impactful web3 projects (via financial stipends, warm introductions, and community support through two-month-long internship-like experiences) 
3. **IRL Regen Web3 Gatherings:** which convene diverse, inspiring, regen-minded thinkers and builders in a way that forges relationships and collaborations across the “regen web3” field/movement (and builds excitement for the idea of hiring more regen Gen Zers—who co-organize the events—to impactful web3 projects)

(Yes, we have other smaller things we’re involved in, but these are what we need to devote the vast majority of our resources to)

To elaborate on #3 **(IRL Regen Web3 Gatherings)**...

- **These events will happen during times and in places when target attendees (not Builders—people we want to network with) are traveling anyway.** For example, it makes sense for Dream DAO to host an event in NYC during the time when [NFT.NYC](http://NFT.NYC) is happening.
    - Other examples could include:
        - Indian Dream DAO Builders hosting a gathering during a big web3 conference in India
        - European Dream DAO Builders hosting a gathering during some major web3 conference in Europe
        - LatAM Dream DAO Builders hosting a gathering during some major web3 conference in Latin America
- They will almost always be invite-only—because the point is to help establish and supercharge the “regen web3” field, not vaguely increase awareness of Dream DAO
- The costs of these should almost always be covered by sponsors like Celo, Protocol Labs, NEAR, 50 Years etc who have a vested interest in nurturing regen web3 and looking like leaders of the field
- These events need to be altogether fun, inspiring, educational, and productive for the participants. It needs to feel clear to participants just how badly needed Dream DAO is as a public good
- **These events are the main reason we will fly out Dream DAO Builders. Who will we fly out? Builders that help organize the event they are flying out to help host/participate in AND/OR Builders who will volunteer during the event.** (Help organize for Season 2 generally means helping Gary the Chief Alchemist with whatever needs to be done to make the event a reality. Gary is open to suggestions on when and where an event might ought to be planned.)
    - To get into potential nitty gritty details of how Builders could get selected, we could...
        - ...have a selection process as follows:
            1. Builders fill out an application that demands why they should go
            2. If the number of trip stipends < number of applications that meet all the criteria, the community rank choice votes on which applicants that meet all the criteria get ultimately selected
        - ...enforce that Builders can only go to 2 events per Season (this could be increased if we get a LOT of funding from sponsors), and that someone who helped organize the event and hasn’t gone yet will get priority to be flown out if trip stipends are scarce
    - We will have event-hosting training for Builders and partner with seasoned event organizers for events that are more than just small lunches/dinners
- Dream DAO Builders who are selected to fly out to support an event will be required to create a learning artifact (blog post by default) about their experience
