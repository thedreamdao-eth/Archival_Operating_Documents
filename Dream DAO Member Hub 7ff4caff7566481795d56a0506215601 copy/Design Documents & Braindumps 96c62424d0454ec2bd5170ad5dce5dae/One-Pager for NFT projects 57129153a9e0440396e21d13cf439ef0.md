**Our community is assembled of small cohorts of exceptional Gen Zers from around the globe, called Builders, and a network of Champions, who are established leaders from a range of relevant industries. Our community provides them with community, education, funding, mentorship, internship opportunities, and decentralized governance experience.**

(roadmap or some graphic here)

Our approach has proven a great success. Our builders are already doing great things in different disciplines: some of our Builders are part of Gitcoin DAO and work in the public goods space, while others are helping their local communities by educating them about web3.

### **These Builders can be a valuable part of your community!**

These Gen Zers have immense potential and are eager to participate in the larger web3 ecosystem - but they need encouragement and resources to learn and build in the web3 space. By gifting our community, or a particular Builder, an NFT or token, you empower them to participate in the growing web3 space. Your donation could be stepping stone for someone into their web3 journey!

Its not just a token or an NFT but a stepping stone for someone in their web3 journey. 

You get to decide whether you want to give the nft to members of the dao or the dao itself.
