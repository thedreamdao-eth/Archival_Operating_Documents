When we’re encouraging existing Builders to plug back in, we should make it very simple for them.

We should tell them…

1. First and foremost, they should read a couple recent editions of Dream Journal in the [Dream Journals](../Evergreen%20Documents%20976d2984e99f4146b4283457a2303a7c/Evergreen%20Documents%20Database%20db1ccc6322ae474dba4b59d6b687d080/Dream%20Journals%2075f1fff9b82646749d1dce8ea5ded0e2.md) 
2. Second, they should start attending [Learning Together](../Guides%20&%20How-To%E2%80%99s%2063c1f45fab634aeaa80bf88fbf4b1c2c/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Together%20%F0%9F%8C%9E%20-%20Overview%20506ac632cd274e0392d809956a546ccd.md) sessions when you can—these are the heartbeat of our learning-centered community. They require no prep to join and are a great way to reconnect with other members of the community.
3. Third, if they want a slightly higher commitment experience at Dream DAO, they should join and contribute to a working group.
