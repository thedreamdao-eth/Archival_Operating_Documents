# Consolidation of regen activity on Twitter — lack of documented outsider-friendly resources

How it's not serving stakeholders sufficiently: Although much of current activity of regen web3 occurs in the vibrant Twitter community, it is crucial to also document & fossilize the ideas that flow through the feed on a daily basis.

We want to encourage more regen web3-ers to contribute their collective brainpower towards mediums/platforms that last — such as a pamphlet, blog, etc. This lays the groundwork for newcomers to pick up the trail and follow the path! Just like we all did once upon a time. 🧚🏻
