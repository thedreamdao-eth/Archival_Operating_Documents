# Public understanding of crypto

How it's not serving stakeholders sufficiently: The current reputation of crypto runs adjacent to investment/stocks. Many outsiders are keen to compare crypto to ponzi schemes and exclusive NFT projects that go viral (think Bored Ape) signal a capital, elitist brand for cryptocurrency. 

Although “degen” motives laid the groundwork for web3, it’s time to turn this narrative around and showcase the many regenerative capabilities of wisely harnessed blockchain technologies. And it all starts with earnestly curating access points & projects like these which allows for Joe Bob to discover a new side to cryptocurrency. 💚
