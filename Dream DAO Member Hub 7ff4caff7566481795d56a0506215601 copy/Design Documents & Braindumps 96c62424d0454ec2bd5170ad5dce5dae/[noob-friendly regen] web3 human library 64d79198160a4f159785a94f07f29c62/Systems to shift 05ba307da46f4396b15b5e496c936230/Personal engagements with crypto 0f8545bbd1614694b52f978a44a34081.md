How it's not serving stakeholders sufficiently: Our job isn’t just to explain that “hey, regen web3 exists!” 👋🏽

Our ultimate job is to allow our fellow voyagers to feel seen, empowered, encouraged — and that they belong within this regenerative story. Through specific design choices, we want readers to have a clear sense of how they might find their niche or “you-shaped hole” in regen web3 (alongside investment, too if they’re into that, ofc!)
