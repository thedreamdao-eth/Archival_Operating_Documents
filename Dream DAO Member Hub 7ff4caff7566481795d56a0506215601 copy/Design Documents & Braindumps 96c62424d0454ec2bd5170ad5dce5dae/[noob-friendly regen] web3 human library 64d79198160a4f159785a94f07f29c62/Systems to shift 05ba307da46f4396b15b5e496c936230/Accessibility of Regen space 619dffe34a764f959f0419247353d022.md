# Accessibility of Regen space

How it's not serving stakeholders sufficiently: Regen web3 is incredibly inaccessible. You gotta 1) be on twitter 2) find regen web3ers on twitter 3) follow who they’re following or like voluntarily go down a regen rabbithole via Gitcoin? or Vitalik? Bankless? All of which are time-intensive and unlikely to occur unless you have a community to co-learn with (such as a DAO).

Early birds should not have to be crippled by a lack of network legacy to learn about regen web3. So...let’s change that!
