Systems to shift,How it's not serving stakeholders sufficiently
Public understanding of crypto,"The current reputation of crypto runs adjacent to investment/stocks. Many outsiders are keen to compare crypto to ponzi schemes and exclusive NFT projects that go viral (think Bored Ape) signal a capital, elitist brand for cryptocurrency. 

Although “degen” motives laid the groundwork for web3, it’s time to turn this narrative around and showcase the many regenerative capabilities of wisely harnessed blockchain technologies. And it all starts with earnestly curating access points & projects like these which allows for Joe Bob to discover a new side to cryptocurrency. 💚"
Visibility of Impact DAOs,"Without conventional methods of advertising, Impact DAOs are quite difficult to find. Most Impact DAOs signal their existence within the regen twitter insider’s jungle — not much reaches the rims of the forest. 

By including & hyping up our incredible impact DAOs, we get to fangirl them while bringing in more fangirls. The more fans of regen web3, the more certainly the better. ;)"
Personal engagements with crypto,"Our job isn’t just to explain that “hey, regen web3 exists!” 👋🏽

Our ultimate job is to allow our fellow voyagers to feel seen, empowered, encouraged — and that they belong within this regenerative story. Through specific design choices, we want readers to have a clear sense of how they might find their niche or “you-shaped hole” in regen web3 (alongside investment, too if they’re into that, ofc!)"
Accessibility of Regen space,"Regen web3 is incredibly inaccessible. You gotta 1) be on twitter 2) find regen web3ers on twitter 3) follow who they’re following or like voluntarily go down a regen rabbithole via Gitcoin? or Vitalik? Bankless? All of which are time-intensive and unlikely to occur unless you have a community to co-learn with (such as a DAO).

Early birds should not have to be crippled by a lack of network legacy to learn about regen web3. So...let’s change that!"
Language barriers of crypto,
Network dependency of web3,"Can web3 onboarding be the friendly boy-next-door? She can be, that is. But at the moment, it’s more like — let me introduce you to my mom’s cousin’s friend’s uncle’s son who happens to know what the heck this elusive, mythical thing called regen web3 is. 🐲

Adopting new movements via personal connection is impactful & important, but personal connection/network should not be the primary gate of entry. "
Regen web3 traffic,"We want to bring more traffic towards this space! Not only to popularize and scale but allow for many hands to touch the fabric and integrate into the regen story! 🧣

Regen operates on an abundant, pluralistic ethos. Newcomers are always welcome and by growing our traffic, we can also grow our media traffic. Hopefully, regen web3 will be clout-y enough to overtake the provocative degen-esque crypto stories that dominate the media algorithims & newscreens. "
Consolidation of regen activity on Twitter — lack of documented outsider-friendly resources,"Although much of current activity of regen web3 occurs in the vibrant Twitter community, it is crucial to also document & fossilize the ideas that flow through the feed on a daily basis.

We want to encourage more regen web3-ers to contribute their collective brainpower towards mediums/platforms that last — such as a pamphlet, blog, etc. This lays the groundwork for newcomers to pick up the trail and follow the path! Just like we all did once upon a time. 🧚🏻"
Approachability of web3,"Most importantly, web3 onboarding should feel comfy & approachable. It’s definitely intimidating — with the unfamiliarity, fancy words, idealism, and all. Let’s bring this down to earth so that a middle aged lady in Ohio or a curious 16-year-old from Cambodia can feel like this is something that they could realistically see themselves becoming a part of.

There’s definitely a point where coolness turns into intimidation. 🌋"
Participatory Design,"Ultimately, through all of this, we hope to onboard tons of newbies into the regen web3 movement and draw upon their unique lived experiences, background, and strengths to enrich the participatory design that must occur during the critical groundwork stage of regen web3.

We must decentralize access & participation in this space to truly live up to our vision of a regenerative future! 💚"
