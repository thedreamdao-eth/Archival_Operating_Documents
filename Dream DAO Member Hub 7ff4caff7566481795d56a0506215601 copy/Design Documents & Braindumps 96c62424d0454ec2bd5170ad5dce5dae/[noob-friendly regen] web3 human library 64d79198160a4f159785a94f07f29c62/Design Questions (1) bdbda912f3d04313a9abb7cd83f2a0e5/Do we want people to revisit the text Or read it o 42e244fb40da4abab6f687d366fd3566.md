# Do we want people to revisit the text? Or read it once and branch off of it onto new resources? Or both?

Working answer: Ideally, the pamphlet is a launching point that branches into a new resource or more niche web3 rabbithole. We can provide many links to recommended, reliablle resources at the end of the reading roadmap for the rabbithole to begin.

Revisits to the actual content may moreso serve for sharing/communicating purposes for users.
