# Integrate (continuously) translated versions

Notes: Despite the prevalence of global english, we want to remain accomodating to as many languages as possible. 

With the high interest of crypto in South and Central American countries, we’d like to include translations in Spanish, Portugese, etc. . . . as many as possible! We also prioritize languages spoken by Dream DAO’s current Builders such as Hindi, Telegu, Russian, and German.
