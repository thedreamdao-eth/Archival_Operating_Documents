# External resource netting

Notes: Be careful about not saturating with hyperlinks and external resources! e.g. Messari Report

Put resources at the end of the page!
Answers what design choices/: Do we want people to revisit the text? Or read it once and branch off of it onto new resources? Or both? (../Design%20Questions%20(1)%20bdbda912f3d04313a9abb7cd83f2a0e5/Do%20we%20want%20people%20to%20revisit%20the%20text%20Or%20read%20it%20o%2042e244fb40da4abab6f687d366fd3566.md), If it's introductory, then wouldn't it be difficult to make people come back as they take dives at the deeper end? We would have to make it so that it's like a node that holds the other nodes together- we don't want to create information gap esp for newbies.
