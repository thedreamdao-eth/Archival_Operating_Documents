# Comeback framework

It’s better to make it a framework, as some of the affairs + resources representing them (e.g. Dream Journal, One-off tasks) are changing constantly.

- **I’m thinking of:**
    1. A current version of the Dream Journal 
    2. A meeting with their main WG co-lead to discuss affairs in this WG + help a person plug into their WG better
    3. A couple of One-off tasks (like POAP delivery) give a person a sense of accomplishing something hence the motivation to continue
    4. Some social media activities (likes, retweets, blog posts, etc)
    5. Sign up for intros!
