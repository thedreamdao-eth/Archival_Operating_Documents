# Brainstorm on Voting Member Re-Engagement Version 2

## Processes:

### **Membership Renewal:** ü§ù

People should renew their membership through a check-in meeting ***every phase or six-month period*** (whichever is shorter, with a one-month grace period). This meeting could be with a:

1. Working group lead, or 
2. The Membership Committee.

This works extremely well in organizations + councils and won‚Äôt create excessive paperwork or hassle.

### **Don‚Äôt add stigma to disengagement:** ü•∞

It can be hard to plug into a new and constantly evolving world. Let‚Äôs be patient with folx!

In the case that someone is choosing a send-off, we never know what may be going on in someone‚Äôs life - let‚Äôs be kind. We want members to speak positively of our community, and there is a chance that they may want to return.

## Reasons to Consider

1. **Lack of time**
    
    Folx may have a lot on their plate or may not be willing to share the personal reasons that cause them to unplug. Don‚Äôt question their commitments, just gently offer a few easy ways that they could plug in. If they aren‚Äôt interested, that‚Äôs okay! Everyone is dealing with their own stuff that we don‚Äôt know about.
    
2. **Lack of context**
    
    Folx may feel like they don‚Äôt have a grasp of web3 concepts or current events in the DAO. This is something we can address in advance - let‚Äôs make it easy for them to understand!
    
    **Ways we can do this:**
    
    - Responding to questions in #ask-anything
    - Leveraging the Learning Together sessions and Dream Journal as ways to introduce new concepts in web3 and updates from working groups
    - Being open to 1:1s to discuss further
    - Being open to community feedback on Learning Together topics
    - Meeting with a WG lead on/reading the WG updates of their primary WG
    - Have a standardized WG email format
    - Other things?

3. **Lack of interest**
    
    People may feel like contributing to the DAO isn‚Äôt beneficial to them. Everyone has their own reasons for this, from lack of community to lack of relevant topics, and the DAO‚Äôs job is to evolve to meet their needs. This is something we can do preventatively - let‚Äôs address with less engaged members.
    
    **Ways to address this:**
    
    - Facilitate a range of community discussions (ex: member of the day, solarpunk studies, etc.)
    - Create a culture of appreciation and recognition by using #community-love
    - Be open to community feedback on Learning Together topics
    - Actively promote inviting others to Learning Together sessions
    - Create universally fun, low-stakes community bonding events (solarpunk puzzles, meme competitions)
    - Continue to facilitate Intros meetings
    - Make it easy for folx to plug in by keeping a list/register of active projects
    - Other things?

## The Plug-In Process

1. If a member is struggling to plug in (ex: not doing WG tasks, not renewing their membership, haven‚Äôt heard from them in a while), a member of the Membership Committee or Community Building WG will follow up with them. 
    
    The person struggling to plug in will be asked to fill out a pre-meeting survey (Paperform) where members can indicate they have troubles with plugging in/participating in Dream DAO.
    
    **Not necessary to ask for a reason if they don‚Äôt want to.** üíì
    
2. A subgroup of the Membership or Community Building Committee facilitates a send-off meeting with the member (if they are open to it), where they discuss their intentions in the community.
    
    
    - If they express the wish to plug back in now or later, we:
        - set a tentative date to follow-up,
        - send a Dream Journal issue and the latest WG updates,
        - offer up the micro plug-in kit and make plans to plug in, and
        - treat them with kindness and compassion.

    - If they wish to depart the community, we:
        - send them off (either with or without public announcement, made by a membership committee member, based on their preference),
        - move them to the ‚Äúdeactivated members‚Äù database,
        - restrict their access to the ‚Äúfrens‚Äù and ‚ÄúHODLer‚Äù roles,
        - give them access to a special ‚Äúalums‚Äù channel, and
