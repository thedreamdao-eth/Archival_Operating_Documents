# Off-Boarding process

Well, firstly, I think we should define who are we off-boarding: according to initial Gary’s message, I assume it's the Voting Members (VM) in general - Champions and Builders, who are no longer contributing to the community. There are two ways we will have to go about it, as the Champs are contributing money for their NFT, while builders are receiving them for free. Hmm

Opinion: As the Builders are not minting the nfts themselves, I think it would be wise to have them issued back in case they want to off-board, as they’re not contributing to the community, which is or, I think, should be the requirement of having a membership NFT which is not minted for a person’s money. Hmmm x2

**Meta:** 
Have the [Comeback Committee ](Comeback%20Committee%2055f773d6259f477992033b83ea9677f5.md)post a simple message explaining why they can't contribute anymore (if they are comfortable sharing). the preference would be for them to send the message, but if not Gary could.

## F**or Builders:**

1. Have them return an NFT/NFTs
2.  Restrict the Voting member + hodler channels access 
3. Restrict the Dream DAO Notion editing perms 
4. Remove them from the Voting Membe Databases (but maybe create a one for those who leave) - shoutout Madison for this
5. Send a simple message to the DreamerZ explaining why the person is leaving the DAO (if they are comfortable sharing). The preference would be for the person to send the message, but, if not, [Comeback Committee](Comeback%20Committee%2055f773d6259f477992033b83ea9677f5.md)/Gary could do this. - and for this one, too haha
6. Give them a Fren status 

## For Champs:

1.  Restrict the Voting member channel access + Remove their Champ role on discord so they become a hodler
2. Restrict the Dream DAO Notion editing perms
3. Remove them from the Voting Member Databases (should we create a one for the hodlers, too, then?)

**Saf:** Will be be actively reaching out to voting members who aren’t active/contibuting to initiate the offboarding process (I would recommend this)? Or will we just wait for people to step up and ask to be offboarded (unlikely that people will do this)?
