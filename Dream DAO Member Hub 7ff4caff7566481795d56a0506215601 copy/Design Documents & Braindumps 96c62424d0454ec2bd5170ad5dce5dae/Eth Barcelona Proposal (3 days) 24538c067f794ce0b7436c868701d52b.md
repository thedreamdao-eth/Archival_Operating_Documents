**Statement of Purpose**

I’m attending ETH Barcelona in order to participate in conversations around digital public goods funding and meet partners in that mission wherever I can. I’m hoping to use the conference in order to become more established in the space and represent the organizations that I’m involved in to a broader audience: Gitcoin, Dream DAO, and Forefront. Given that ETH Barcelona is expecting many student attendees from universities around Europe, I think this would be a great venue to expand our global community and loop in more college students who are aligned with our mission, and I’d love to help do that in as many conversations as I can. During this conference, I will mainly be focusing on (1) understanding barriers to entry in web3 in global communities and helping think through how Dream DAO can tackle those challenges and (2) learning as much as I can to inform my work on product marketing for Gitcoin’s upcoming grants protocol launch. In addition to my reflection / learning artifact, I am happy to produce another blog post or podcast episode centered on the former question for Dream DAO. 

For the sake of transparency, my travels to Barcelona will be part of a longer ~2.5-week trip I take with QZ and several other technologists until ETHcc in Paris; however, if approved, I will be using the Dream DAO grant **solely to fund my plane ticket**, where I will help represent the DAO, and will be funding the other parts of my trip through my own means and other grants. I am happy to answer any questions about this via DM (spacenihilist#8886) if there are any concerns.
