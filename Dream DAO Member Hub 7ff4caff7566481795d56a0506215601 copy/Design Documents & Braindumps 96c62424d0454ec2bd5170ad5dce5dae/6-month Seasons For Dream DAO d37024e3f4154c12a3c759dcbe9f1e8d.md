üí° A proposal for Dream DAO to: 
‚ÜíüóìÔ∏è¬†Extend Season 2 from July 1st-November 1st to **July 1st-December 31st**
‚Üí‚è±Ô∏è¬†Standardize that all Dream DAO seasons are 6-months long by default

## Background

---

- Season 1 of the Dream DAO was 6 months long
- The current plan is for Season 2 to be 4 months long
- My concern (Madison) is that 4 months is just too short of a time for an entire season (Gitcoin runs in 4-month seasons and is even considering moving to 6)
- **It is hard to run a season in 4 months because:**
    - There is essentially 1 month at the start of the Season preparing- onboarding + getting working groups running and actually able to do things
    - There is about 1 month of prep work at the end of the season- planning the budget and holding elections for the next season
    - It is hard to sell NFTs when you sell them 4 times per year
    - The Civics Unplugged fellowship runs on a bi-annual schedule- not a quarterly one- and it is harder to recruit when you don‚Äôt have the momentum of a Fellowship wrapping up
    - Workings groups are limited in what they can do with only a few months
    - It will likely take new builders at least 6 months to become familiar / acquainted with web3 and prepared to be sort of mentors to the next cohort
    - Does not align with our vision of bi-annual explorers program
    - Overall- less time is spent on the things we love and more time is spent on operational processes that have to recur every season
    

## Overview

---

This idea is to make seasons 6-months by default. If we ever need an extension or feel like we can end it sooner, of course we can change it. 

Overall, there is no need to move fast when it is clear that moving fast is unnecessary and actually doesn‚Äôt make sense for the work that we want to do. I believe that 6-month seasons will afford us much more time to provide value to our members and execute our goals.
