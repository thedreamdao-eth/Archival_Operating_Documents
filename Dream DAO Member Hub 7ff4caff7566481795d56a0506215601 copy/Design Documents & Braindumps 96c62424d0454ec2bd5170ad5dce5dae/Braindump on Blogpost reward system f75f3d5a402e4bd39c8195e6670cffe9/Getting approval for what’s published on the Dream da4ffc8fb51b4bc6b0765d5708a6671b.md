# Getting approval for what’s published on the Dream DAO Mirror

The blogposts the came of the [Braindump on Blogpost reward system](../Braindump%20on%20Blogpost%20reward%20system%20f75f3d5a402e4bd39c8195e6670cffe9.md) need to have approval of the community because its going to represent us to the wider world .

One of the ways to get approval for the blogpost is through **weekly or bi-weekly community calls** where we could discuss all the miscellaneous things that don’t fit any particular box but need the approval of the community.

As bounties will be given out from the DAO treasury there needs to be consensus of the people. Here are some ways to do so-

- Have a thread where we could edit the post and share our thoughts on it and on the final day have a discord poll.
- Discuss it in community hangout or the Learning meeting?
- Snapshot proposal if the amount is big and needs a snapshot vote
