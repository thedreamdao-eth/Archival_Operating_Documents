🎯**Goals:** Having a person that leads Dream DAO’s Twitter with content and strategy adapted on a monthly base.

🏋️**Point of Contact:**

Bear (Marco)#8146, @MarcoBear_eth

💡**Description:**

Create the role of Twitter guardian.

The Twitter Guardian will keep Dream DAO’s Twitter page active and updated continuously.

The twitter guardian will post 1 original Tweet and 4 retweets every working day (100 every month), following a monthly flexible strategy linked to the goals and priority of the DAO. A specific list will be created to be used for creating social media relationships with people that know Dream DAO (with daily interactions and daily retweets).

I am proposing myself for this role. I would be a great candidate as it’s something that I’ve been passionately doing social media management in the last 5 years to maintain myself. For reviewing some of my recent work (web3 related) please check [All For Climate’s Twitter page](https://twitter.com/all4climatedao?s=21&t=IjNbkhinvy3zeyuzKyTIpQ), which I have been managing in the last 4+ months, with around 40k of impressions last month.
