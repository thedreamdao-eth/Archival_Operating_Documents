Dream DAO has changed my life. Wanna know how?

It has opened me up to a whole new world of web3, making it clear that there is still hope to change the world for the better in ways I didn’t even know existed!

It has truly(!!!) empowered me with opportunities and resources to improve my skills & knowledge and get a lot of experience in web3 team and project management (and a lot more fields, actually), while also making me decide that I want to pursue my career in web3.

It made me understand that the best way to learn is trying and persisting until you get it, and through that, helped me find my passions - ops leading, coordination, and strategizing. Not to mention that it helped me find other DAOs, where I can apply my skills and knowledge, while doing what I like to do!

But most importantly, Dream DAO taught me how taking initiative, not being afraid of my young age, and embracing my creative side will immensely accelerate my personal growth and the impact I make, wherever I am.
