Dream DAO is one of the most supportive communities I've been in! The energy of the people in this community is unparalleled and made the process of learning about web3 so much less overwhelming, and being surrounded by people who were so determined to use web3 for social good was what drove me to commit to making a career in this space. Thanks to the support of my peers, I've been able to become a paid contributor at Forefront and Gitcoin, and I couldn't be more grateful!
