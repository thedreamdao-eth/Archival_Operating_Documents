Before the Dream DAO was a part of my life, I thought I had a pretty solid idea of what our future looked like. My imagined personal trajectory and humanity's trajectory were both married to ideas I had been taught my whole life. Dream DAO introduced me to an entirely different theory of what's possible for us and let me meet people who were flush with a kind of anti-inertia and child-like positivity x adult-grade thoughtfulness and experience. I think that's the most important part. Web3 for me has become less of a techno-optimistic thing and more of a people-optimist thing. It's this kind of scary but courageous idea that with a resilient, curious attitude, we can relearn our relationship with tech to mend systemic damage and evolve out of our past mistakes. Nothing is guaranteed, but I think it's worth trying, right?
