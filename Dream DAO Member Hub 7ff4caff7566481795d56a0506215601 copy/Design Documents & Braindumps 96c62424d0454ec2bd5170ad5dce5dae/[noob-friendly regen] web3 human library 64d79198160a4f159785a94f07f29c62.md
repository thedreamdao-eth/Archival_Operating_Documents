***What is the thing you are designing?***

**Design a gen-z/web3 noob-friendly digital pamphlet for regenerative web3!**

***What are the ultimate objectives?***

Open a door for the crypto-curious but not-yet-greenpilled to realize that the regen web3 community exists and see how they can plug into it without having to rely on the elusive regen web3 Twitter community for critical information, background, and context.

### Background

---

**We are stunned by the lack of regenerative web3 resources for the public (who are very familiar with the degen side of web3). We want to create a digital, interactive pamphlet to tell the story of regen web3 for the crypto-curious but not-yet-greenpilled.**

Accessible, share-able, meme-able storytelling mechanism the *Degen â†’ Regen narrative* 

- **Clear, succinct, & casual explainer of web3â€™s use cases beyond StOnKs & NFTs** ðŸ¤‘
    - Define & Apply (revolutionary) Features like: collective governance, sovereignty, composability, interoperability, pluralistic, global, decoupled,
        - Play it safe with more controversial features like decentralized, permissionless (for more conservative folks)
    - Make sure to curate seamless analogies & continuously compare/contrast (honestly!) with web2 status quos
    - Do not market web3 as a complete revolution â€” as not to alienate on-the-fencers. Remain down-to-earth & approachable.
- **Beyond the use-cases, clearly identify purpose & meaning**
    - Okay, web3 has really cool potential use cases....so, what?
- **Feature most promising & relatable Impact DAOs (SEEDS, Protein, etc.)**
    - (Dream DAO included, of course)
- Unlike Greenpilled, is **lighter, friendlier read** & caters towards **neutral people** who can be led into their niche in regen web3
