Summary?: This brain dump focuses on the leadership structure of the Dream DAO in the upcoming season and how Co-Stewards will spend their time on a weekly basis.

Right now, the structure of Dream DAO leadership is 2 Co-stewards. As we move into season 3 and continue to streamline our processes and decentralize the DAO, we should think about our future leadership structure. 

One Champion and one Builder, at 15-20 hours per week for a Builder and 10 hours per week for the Champion. Paid $2,000 a month each. These will be the Co-Stewards. 

Leading up to season 3, the Coordination Wizard will work to document all of the tiny details that aren’t currently documented, like how to mint SkywalkerZ.

Collectively, the responsibilities of the Co-Stewards will be:

- Attending working group meetings and advising on the direction of the working group activities (this takes the most time)
- “Managing” recurring roles- essentially making sure they are happy and fulfilling their responsibilities
- Attending LTs
- Speaking publicly on behalf of the DAO
- Make monthly payments
- Planning conference trips (1-2 per season)
- Onboarding new members
- Managing the Twitter

On a “normal” week, a Co-steward might spend their time: 

- 3 hours on working groups, attending 2 working group meetings and reviewing documents
- 3 hours on misc tasks
- 2 hours on Twitter
- 2 hours speaking on behalf of the DAO
- 2 hours planning a conference
- 1-hour managing recurring roles
- 1-hour attending Learning Togethers
- 1 hour making monthly payments

= 15 hours total 

Activities that will take way less time in Season 3: 

- Gatherings because we will not have the Celo grant to host a ton of in-person events (like the Yale and India one) and send Builders to a ton of conferences
- Making payments because of Utopia Labs
- Strategy for budget and high-level direction, because we should define a lot of that during season 2
