# 📢hodler-announcements

Category: Members and Friends
Action: Archive
Remark for Action: Since we only post LT announcements here while other events are public (e.g. DDAO Twitter Space), we should post LT announcements in the LT channel.
It will allow us to post truly big events (e.g. Twitter spaces) in the public “announcements” channel  for public visitors to see + will make the server less confusing with like 3 different annmouncements channel.
