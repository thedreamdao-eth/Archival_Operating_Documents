Encouraging Buidlers to write about their journeys and stories of being a youngling in the world of web3 and publishing those ideas as a blog and rewarding the ones that get selected to be published through the Dream DAO Mirror account. 

[Getting approval for what’s published on the Dream DAO Mirror](Braindump%20on%20Blogpost%20reward%20system%20f75f3d5a402e4bd39c8195e6670cffe9/Getting%20approval%20for%20what%E2%80%99s%20published%20on%20the%20Dream%20da4ffc8fb51b4bc6b0765d5708a6671b.md)

Builders have a lot of wisdom to impart to the world and as once a steward said to a kid “ **You are an expert in your own experience**”

It could help builders cultivate-

- A Sense of unity in their struggle of learning web3.
- Really making the DAO of the builders its trying to help onboard into web3 by making them feel heard.
- Help builders share their story and lay the facts straight — the good and the bad — for those looking for honest, un-agenda-d insider perspective of DAOs and web3 and how participation will make / break the potential of blockchain technology x society
- Serve as a time capsule for their learning and community-building journeys

It would help the dao create a pipeline of content that could help other kids resonate and maybe even help them while also helping builders make some eth which could then lead them to tinker with the web3 world. 

Would be cool to have
