Hey!

My name is Gary. I’m one of the co-founders of [Dream DAO](https://dreamdao.xyz/), a global, diverse youth-empowering community that launched in January 2022 that trains and onboards regen-minded Gen Zers to web3 so they can contribute to impact-oriented DAOs, other web3 projects, and the regen web3 space at large.

I would love to launch a targeted basic income program for the 40-something 15-20 year olds in our DAO.

Maybe we can launch a $10,000 three-month pilot where we…

- Define requirements for receiving a GoodDollar basic income (or decide mere membership is enough!)
- Design and release a pre-pilot, mid-pilot, and post-pilot survey
- Stream payments to members who meet this requirement

Objectives include:

- Observing what happens when youth receive a basic income
- Supporting these youth in achieving greater financial security needed to contribute to a nascent space like web3
- Build the GoodDollar x Dream DAO long-term relationship, which will be fruitful given the deep values alignment and shared desire to leverage web3 to empower ordinary people and close inequality gaps
