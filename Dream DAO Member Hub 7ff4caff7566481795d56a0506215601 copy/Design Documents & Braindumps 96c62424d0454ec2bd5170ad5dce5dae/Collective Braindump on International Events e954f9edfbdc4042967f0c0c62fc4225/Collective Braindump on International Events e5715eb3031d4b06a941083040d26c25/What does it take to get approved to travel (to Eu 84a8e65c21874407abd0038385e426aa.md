# What does it take to get approved to travel? (to Europe, US, South America, India, etc)

Gary initial thoughts: I do not have expertise on this. US citizens have so much privilege to travel just about everywhere.
Aditya: Getting a visa to a country that doesn't have any bilateral/multilateral visa agreements with your country is usually a slow and bureaucratic process (if you have a weak passport). However, if you submit the correct documents on time, you should get one without any problem.

I feel that the official government websites cover the process in complete (and sometimes excessive) detail and should be our primary source of information. Navigating the process will be much easier once some builders go through the application process, as they'll be able to help others with their experience.

Can we ask successful applicants to create a short guide that can help us in future events?
Angelina : Many Europeans are eligible for the visa waiver program to the US, meaning that the process of getting an ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization) usually shouldn’t take longer than 72h
(here’s an overview of countries that are eligible for the visa waiver program: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html)

Non-EU residents who want to visit most parts of Europe (Schengen area) need Schengen visa: A Schengen visa is a short stay visa allowing its holder to circulate in the Schengen area.

Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, 
Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
A Schengen visa is an authorisation issued by a Schengen State with a view to:
• an intended stay in the territory of the Schengen States of a duration of no more than 90 days in any 180 days period ("short stay visa"),
• a transit through the international transit areas of airports of the Schengen States ("airport transit visa"). (https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-visa_en)
