# How far in advance do we need to plan group trips to conferences?

Gary initial thoughts: ideally, 3+ months ahead but i think at minimum it should be 1 or so months ahead
Aditya: I also agree that we should plan the trip at least one month ahead to prevent spending exorbitant amounts of money on tickets and to also give people enough time to get a visa.
Angelina : Agreed! I think 6 weeks ahead should be the minimum 
Madhav: Yea, builders need time to get visa stuff sought out and air tickets become drastically more expensive as time runs out
