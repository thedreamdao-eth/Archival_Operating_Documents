# What are the factors that affect whether a Builder can attend a conference?

Gary initial thoughts: → whether parents want them to go
→ whether them want to go
→ social anxiety
→ opportunity cost
→ safety concerns
Angelina : yes, tho main points were already mentioned, I just think that the time we announce the conferences/attendance plans also plays a role in this, especially when people are in school/college. In this case we should probably take into account spring breaks/vacations etc.
