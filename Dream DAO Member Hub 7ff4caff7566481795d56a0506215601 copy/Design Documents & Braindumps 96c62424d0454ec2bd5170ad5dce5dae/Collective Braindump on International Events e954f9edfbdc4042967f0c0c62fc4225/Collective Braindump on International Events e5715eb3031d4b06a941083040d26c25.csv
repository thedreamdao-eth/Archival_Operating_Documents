Question,Gary initial thoughts,Madhav,"Angelina ",Aditya

How far in advance do we need to plan group trips to conferences?,"ideally, 3+ months ahead but i think at minimum it should be 1 or so months ahead","Yea, builders need time to get visa stuff sought out and air tickets become drastically more expensive as time runs out","Agreed! I think 6 weeks ahead should be the minimum ",I also agree that we should plan the trip at least one month ahead to prevent spending exorbitant amounts of money on tickets and to also give people enough time to get a visa.
What are the factors that affect whether a Builder can attend a conference?,"→ whether parents want them to go
→ whether them want to go
→ social anxiety
→ opportunity cost
→ safety concerns",,"yes, tho main points were already mentioned, I just think that the time we announce the conferences/attendance plans also plays a role in this, especially when people are in school/college. In this case we should probably take into account spring breaks/vacations etc.",
Who should accompany Builders that attend conferences? What role(s) should they be playing?,Probably two Champions that will serve as chaperones,,,
Who is approved to travel?,We don’t have enough builders atm to have a voting system - right now basically anyone who wants to go basically has the opportunity to go,,,
"What does it take to get approved to travel? (to Europe, US, South America, India, etc)",I do not have expertise on this. US citizens have so much privilege to travel just about everywhere.,For Indians you need to et visa to literally every country. If you have a good travel histry the visa doesnt take more than 2-3 days but me and some other Indian builders being underage could be a probelm,"Many Europeans are eligible for the visa waiver program to the US, meaning that the process of getting an ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization) usually shouldn’t take longer than 72h
(here’s an overview of countries that are eligible for the visa waiver program: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html)

Non-EU residents who want to visit most parts of Europe (Schengen area) need Schengen visa: A Schengen visa is a short stay visa allowing its holder to circulate in the Schengen area. The Schengen area covers 26 countries (""Schengen States"") without border controls between them. These countries are: 
Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, 
Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
A Schengen visa is an authorisation issued by a Schengen State with a view to:
• an intended stay in the territory of the Schengen States of a duration of no more than 90 days in any 180 days period (""short stay visa""),
• a transit through the international transit areas of airports of the Schengen States (""airport transit visa""). (https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-visa_en) ","Getting a visa to a country that doesn't have any bilateral/multilateral visa agreements with your country is usually a slow and bureaucratic process (if you have a weak passport). However, if you submit the correct documents on time, you should get one without any problem.

I feel that the official government websites cover the process in complete (and sometimes excessive) detail and should be our primary source of information. Navigating the process will be much easier once some builders go through the application process, as they'll be able to help others with their experience.

Can we ask successful applicants to create a short guide that can help us in future events?"
