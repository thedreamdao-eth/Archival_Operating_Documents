🎯**Goals:**

1. Make Discord more organized by cleaning up unused roles
2. Represent Current roles (WG Lead, Recurring, Co-stewards) in a clear, structured way
3. Clean up the unused bots and add ones that we’ll need.
4. Make the Discord roles easier to navigate (tags, finding resposible people/bots, etc)

💡**Description:**

- The proposal is based on the builders’ and roles’ feedback and is co-designed to make our Discord more organized and easy to navigate.

**Note:** non-infrastructure related ideas (e.g. changing some channels to forums, designing moderation policy) are to be dealt with after we implement these changes.

💚**Benefits:**

- All the unused roles are deleted.
- Roles appearance in the profile are more organized.
- Will be easier to tag people responsible for roles.
- Number of bots decreased to essetials to make using them less confusing.

🗓️**Duration:**

- Start: When the proposal is approved
- End: Approx. first week of Feb to implement the changes
