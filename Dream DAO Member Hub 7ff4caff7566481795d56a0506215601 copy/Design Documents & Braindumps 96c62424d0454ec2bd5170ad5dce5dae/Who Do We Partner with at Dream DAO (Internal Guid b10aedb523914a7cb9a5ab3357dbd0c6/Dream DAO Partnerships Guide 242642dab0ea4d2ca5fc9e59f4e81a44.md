### What is Dream DAO?

Powered by Civics Unplugged, [Dream DAO](http://dreamdao.xyz/) gives Gen Z the funding, mentorship, and training they need to leverage web3 to regenerate people and our planet.

### What we’re looking for…

- **Funders** that want to support our mission to launch Gen Zers into web3 🚀
- **Conference hosts** that want to amplify the voices of Dream DAO Members at their venues 🗣️
- **Media organizations** who are looking to organize values-aligned podcasts and spaces to advance the future of the web3 regen movement 🌱
- **Internship hosts** to provide meaningful internship and collaboration opportunities for our Builders 💼
- **Education-focused organizations** that offer top-notch programming to educate and empower our Builders 🏫

### What we’re cautious about…

- **Additional tooling:** we’re confident that what you’re building is awesome! Unfortunately, Dream DAO isn’t looking for more tooling at the moment.
- **NFT partnerships:** currently, we aren’t looking to offer allowlist spots or do any marketing for any projects to our community. However, if you’re building an impact-focused project and interested in giving NFTs to our community (no strings attached), we’re open to chatting.
