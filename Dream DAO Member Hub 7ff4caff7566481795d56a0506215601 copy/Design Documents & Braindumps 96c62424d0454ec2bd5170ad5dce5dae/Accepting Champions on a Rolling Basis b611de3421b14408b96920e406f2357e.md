At Consensus in Austin, Oliver, Madison, Carl, and I were discussing—at a talk of someone we wanted to recruit to be a Champion—that we need to be really smart about timing of when we invite a Champion.

The default pathway for recruiting and onboarding a Champion can be as simple as this:

- Identify someone cool + values-aligned who we wants to support impact-oriented young people coming into web3
- Inviting them to do a Learning Together Session
- Temperature-checking with the Builders whether they liked the LT session. It will be rare that there is someone that we do not want to recruit.
- If they did, invite them to mint a skywalkerZ NFT (not even buy on secondary) and join as a member and fill out the Champion intake form
    - **This timing is key, because they will be most excited about Dream DAO right after interacting with our Builders- not as much six months after the interaction**
- Onboard them with some 1:1 orientation process (Community Building WG should largely handle this)
    - With personalized ways to plug in based on their bandwidth and skills

We also talked about how the best thing that most Champions can do, if they don’t want to contribute to a working group, is mentor even just ONE person - meaning meet with them every other week just to touch base with them.

Having an adult in someone’s life that is experienced in a potential career path a mentee wants to explore can be life-changing.
