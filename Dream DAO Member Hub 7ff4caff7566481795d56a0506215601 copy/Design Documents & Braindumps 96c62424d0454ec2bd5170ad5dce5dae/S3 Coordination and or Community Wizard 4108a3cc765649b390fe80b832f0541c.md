🧙🏽‍♀️ **Paid** position for the duration of **Season 3** (6 months)

</aside>

Hi, my name is Arath. I am the Community Building WG Lead. I would love to propose **myself** for this position for **Season 3.**

Community Building and Gatherings will merge to be the source of online and in-person events.  (According to However, as we wrapped up S2, I realized that CB isn’t just about creating events and goes way beyond that. Over the past month, I designed the Dream DAO Census (basically Directory 2.0), where we constantly collect information from our members, helping us investigate and facilitate decision-making. This database also helps with other DAO processes like elections, the seasonal Membership Renewal Process, and the boot camp.

The S2 Coordination Wizard has a different set of tasks that will be absorbed by the new Co-Stewards, putting the role at risk. However, with my contributions, I was able to see a future for this role and help different DAO sectors with the power of data and metrics! Let’s see what this new wizard is about.

You are all invited to discuss this role and my participation as Coordination Wizard. Please direct any related questions to the thread below the ideas channel.

Arath.

## Role description ✏️

The Coordination Wizard makes sure the DAO operations and community are functioning correctly. The assigned person will utilize tools that help them understand the current status of the DAO and propose changes to the community if deemed necessary. They create and promote strategies and processes to keep the community united.

## Responsibilities 📒

Responsibilities are distributed in **four areas:**

**DOCUMENTATION AND DATA MANAGEMENT** 📈

- Manage the **DAO Seasonal Census** as necessary to keep track of members and identify community necessities to solve as soon as possible.
- Manage **documentation (**with the help of WGs and Stewards**)** (working groups, stewards, bounties, and other responsibility centers)
- Utilize **metrics, forms, documentation, or any data sources** to provide or design **opportunities** for the community.
- Manage **bounties** and report information to the Co-Stewards for the distribution of bounty payments.
- Analyze member **engagement** (event turnout, frequency of contributions, bounties), contact inactive members, and seek solutions that benefit both parties.
- Present a monthly (or bi-weekly) **recap** with the help of Co-Stewards, documented data, and contributors.
- Present a **report** mid-season and at the end of it to prepare improvements for the next season.

**COMMUNICATIONS** 🛰️

- Look over the **Discord Community.** Facilitate communication channels from the external community to stay in touch with the DAO. (tickets, channels, forms, email addresses, etc.)
    - We abandon our Friends of DAO frequently. As wizard I’d like to stay engaged with them via Discord, work together with the Gatherings WG to create events they can attend and contribute to the Dream DAO CRM.
- **Answer inquiries** from members, potential members, and friends.
- **Represent** the Co-stewards in case of the absence of one or both. Co-Stewards will ask the CW to cover them. The Wizard can’t just go and take the position like Pedro across his house.
- **Make** and **review** forms (hackathon, financial aid, community health, check-in apps, etc).
- **Facilitate** the S3 DAO **Council** meetings.
- **Provide** the community with a season plan/course.
    - Ex. Make a document/infographic telling the community what we should do by x month in the season and abide by it. If S4 applications are set for May (example), the wizard must ensure everything is ok for this to happen.

**RECRUITING** 🔭

- **Connect with partners, use social media and use CU** to spread the word about Dream DAO and invite builders and champions to become part of it.
    - Create Twitter Spaces and Information Sessions in CU and other partner organizations to bring Builders and Champions to Dream DAO
- **Create and review** seasonal **applications** and announce results with the help of an interim council, considering the performance of the season they are on. Do note that the Co-Stewards are in charge of the onboarding.
    - We brought up the safety point when we reviewed apps for S2. Since we are a US-based organization dealing with minors, we should care about the safety of our members when bringing new people. This is why we are interviewing applicants to know they are who they claim they are.

**ROLES AND PROJECTS** 💼

- **Pull out elections** and announce results with the help of an **interim council.**
- Manage **persistent projects** (if any)**.**
- Review roles. Check for functionality and efficiency and discuss with the DAO!
- Weigh in on **financial decisions and** search for **efficient ways** to allow Dream DAO to earn more money to **fund builders** to gain skills used for **hackathons.** (PMs, UX, UI design, programming, marketing, etc.)
- Form the S3 DAO **Council.**

## Skills needed to fulfill this role. 🧠

**SOFT SKILLS** 🗨️

- Communication skills
- Creative thinking
- Conflict resolution
- Problem-solving
- Time management

**TECHNICAL SKILLS** 🔨

- Basic web3 knowledge
    - Knows web3 basics and how to use the platforms for operations.
- Database management
    - Excel and sheets (Excet mainly bc of formula usage)
- Basic data analysis
- Management
    - Project management

## Requirements (for S4) ✅

- All interested members in this role should at least have finished one season in Dream DAO.
- (Discuss with governance if merit badges should give members the right to participate as election candidates)

## Payment 💰

Some S2 tasks will be done by Co-Stewards, but with data playing a notable role in the development of this DAO, the workload has slightly increased due to the constant data updating and consultation of different responsibility centers.

This is an evolution of the CBWG lead with some bits of governance. The CW should get paid **1100.00 USDC** or the equivalent in ETH. Why? Let's consider the CW is working around **three hours a day, five days a week for four weeks.**

Total season 3 spending: **$6,600.00**
