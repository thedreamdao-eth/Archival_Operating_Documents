We recently passed a proposal to allow Champions to join on a rolling basis- but we currently don’t have a process for allowing them to apply/onboard.

 I propose the following simple process: 

- They fill out the Champion interest form: [https://rwvpe5gp.paperform.co](https://rwvpe5gp.paperform.co/)
- The Co-Stewards review the application and give their recommendations (as an overview/in case people don’t want to look at the application in detail)
- The Co-stewards review and make decisions on applications
- If the proposal passes, they will set up a 30-minute onboarding meeting with a co-steward to find personalized ways to plug in
    - They are also sent this document for information: [https://cucrew.notion.site/Dream-DAO-Member-Onboarding-46a1151958e54338bf0798e610f00296](https://www.notion.so/Dream-DAO-Member-Onboarding-46a1151958e54338bf0798e610f00296?pvs=21)
