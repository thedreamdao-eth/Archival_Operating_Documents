We at Dream DAO empower GenZers to be a part of web3 and contribute to the world in a meaningful way.  And one of the best ways to help them explore is funding them to go to places that see the confluence of the best minds. 
Our Alchemist brew a partnership With Celo to help Builders to get to conferences and the first conference in line is ETH CC for which we were ready but as the competition was fierce and there were only 100 tickets in the round we were not able to acquire them. ETH CC stands for Community conference which means its not a hackathon like other Ethereum events but mostly based on community vibes there are going to be a lot of side events and at the same time there will be the Solana Hacker House Paris which a 5-day long hackathon where Devs are mentored by the Solana labs folks and a lot of cool events. And a 5 day event **hosted by Celo which** I could get access to.

I( Madhav) one of the founding Builders of the Dream DAO went to the Solana Hacker House in India and learned the most I had ever in a week even though I was new to Solana. It has fuelled me to work even harder and build something worthwhile and inspires how great would it be if I was able to make it to an Ethereum conference; the ecosystem of Which I have been a part for some time and have devoted my most time. 
I have talked to quite a few of my friends who are going to Paris even though they were not able to get a ticket to the main event because of one of them said ‚Äù When I was in Dubai for ETH Dubai the most I learned and connected was at side events‚Äù hoping that it might be true I would be grateful to get funded to Paris.
**I acknowledge that I won't be a responsibility of the dao and there won't be any Champion as a Chaperone for me. I take my full responsibility and assure the dao that I won't be alone but with friends I have made and planning to going with.
After checking the flight prices and hotel accommodation I won't require more than $1500-2000.**
