I (Gary) have talked to dozens of web3 orgs, and I am pretty concerned about how internships (as they are conceived of in web3 - aka 20-40 stable hours / week and role over many weeks or months) in web3 are VERY RARE. Just think about how much of a headache it would be for DAOs to subvert their default gradual onramp contributor model just for Dream DAO Builders. It looks very unfair if an org that is already low budget is giving kids guaranteed hours and payment when other people are scraping for individual bounties here and there. I think we might want to shift our model for what the Explorers program is to be more aligned with how web3 works.

## **Maybe these are the edits to the Explorers Program:**

**Dream DAO selected Builders who:**

- identified 2-3 DAOs / regen web3 projects they want to contribute to and have already developed a starting relationship with (they have a point of contact who are open to onboarding them in even a minor way)

**Dream DAO gives them $750 for making it 50% through:**

- they must have spent at least 10 hours a week on average for these first 5 weeks
- they must have produced a Learning Artifact
- they must have attended at least 3/5 juntos in first five weeks
- they must have filled out the mid-program survey

**Dream DAO gives them another $750 at the end of the 10 week program:**

- they must have spent at least 10 hours a week on average for the last 5 weeks
- they must have produced a Learning Artifact
- they must have attended at least 3/5 juntos in the last five weeks
- they must have contributed to the Cohort Capstone project
- they must have filled out the post-program survey
- they must have gotten a rep from the orgs they were a part of to fill out the post-program contribution site survey

**Note that the minimum required hours can increase in the next Explorers program (maybe it’s 15 hr a week) because 6 months from now the regen web3 space will be more funded and mature!**
