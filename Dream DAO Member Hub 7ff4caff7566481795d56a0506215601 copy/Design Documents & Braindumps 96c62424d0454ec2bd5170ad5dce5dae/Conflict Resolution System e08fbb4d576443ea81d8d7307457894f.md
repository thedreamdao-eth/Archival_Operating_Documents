## What Types of ADR Processes Are Used in Community Mediation?

Community mediators use methods of dispute resolution that empower participants to advocate for their needs, make their own decisions and be accountable for their actions or decisions. The following are examples of the types of processes that may be used and case examples.

### 1. Mediation

Mediation is a voluntary process whereby mediators help participants work together to resolve conflict. A mediator guides participants in a process, usually face-to-face, that allows participants to hear each other’s concerns and then work with each other to come up with ideas for the resolution of conflict. In this model, a mediator will actively listen to allow everyone an opportunity to build a greater appreciation of others and themselves, **be impartial** and not take sides or give advice, and **support the participants through a collaborative problem-solving process**. During this process, participants can either (1) develop solutions that meet their needs, or (2) decide to remain in the parts of the conflict they are not yet ready to face or address.

Community mediation centers use a variety of models and styles. Together, these methods help people experiencing conflict to create solutions that fit their needs and help them transform their relationship for the better. Mediation may be used to resolve a wide variety of disputes including: neighbor/property disputes, landlord/tenant issues, parenting and child custody issues, work disputes and criminal matters.

***Case example:** Joe purchases a riding lawn mower from Janice after learning of the mower through a neighborhood communication app. The mower ceases working within two weeks and Joe publicly, through the app, accuses Janice of knowingly selling him a lemon. Janice responds by denigrating Joe. Another app user suggests that the two use a community mediator to resolve the issue.*

### 2. **Facilitation**

Facilitating small or large community conversations is an often-used service of community mediation. Trained facilitators can help design meetings, lead effective decision-making processes, ensure that all voices are heard and keep meetings on-track so that the community’s goals can be reached. In community mediation, facilitators use conflict-resolution skills to help keep conversations productive. Using local facilitators who live in or near a community is often advantageous in that they understand the cultural constructs that impact the issues being discussed.

***Case example:** A school board wants to acquire land near a residential neighborhood to build a football stadium. Residents of the neighborhood are concerned about noise levels, traffic flow, aesthetics and property values. School board meetings have been raucous as residents have made their concerns known. A community mediator is called in to help design and facilitate meetings wherein all stakeholders have the opportunity to voice their opinions, ask questions and offer ideas as to how to meet the school’s needs without negatively affecting the neighborhood.*

### 3. Conciliation

Conciliation is a process whereby a conciliator goes back and forth between parties in conflict to try to bring about resolution. As in mediation, the participants are responsible for decision-making.

***Case example:** Sharon and Doreen were in the same college sorority years ago. They have different political opinions and, through the sorority’s alumnae email list, have been antagonistic. After some particularly antagonistic exchanges, both Sharon and Doreen removed themselves from the list and the group, and refused to communicate with each other. The alumnae group had been tight, and the group members were hopeful that Sharon and Doreen could agree to some ground rules that would allow for their continued participation in the group. It was decided that Sally, who is respected by Sharon, Doreen and the group, would attempt to conciliate between the two. She called one, and the other, and shared their ideas, back and forth, as to how the women could communicate without pushing the other’s political buttons. Within a month, they had agreed to the guidelines and joined the group once more.*
