**Summary of the braindump discussion from [the thread](https://discord.com/channels/896096170621947974/947356680021217290) :**

The problem: 

There's been an unintended consolidation of disproportionately contributing builders in this space . Our enthusiastic volunteerism often leads to first come first serve assignments. If left unchecked, we see patterns of centralization emerge in our DAO. We have 41 builders none of whom have found their “niche”

The problem is, DAOs need to be driven by personal agency. So, I think a very good middle ground is like recurrent evaluations of builders and voluntary sign ups. Like for example, you’re a builder for “x” weeks/months and expected to contribute “x” amount per week. That makes it so we can assign and make sure that everyone’s staying on top of things

We can encourage pluralistic contribution by creating processes that practice cadenced checks for consolidation + redistribution of engagement across the builder community.

Basically we want to make sure that everyone finds a way to add value on the same order of magnitude.

Contribution alignment is comprised of a couple of things: 
setting *voluntary* expectations, being accountable/reachable, and experimenting with where to contribute

### Braindump

- **emmani:** decrease amount of channels?
- **emmani:** don’t know where to start after a long break
- **emmani:** centralized — 70% of stuff gets done by the same people
- **vedanth:** more discord moderation (support team)
- **arath:** channels are overwhelming and you can easily get lost. it’s hard to learn about web3 and you don't know where to contribute and you feel like you need to do everything on the list. by opting in and out of channels, it will better help you find your you-shaped hole.
- **arman:** we can find opt-in tags like spontaneous hangouts like civics unplugged
- **vedanth:** having so many projects open and threads and channels; maybe we can turn them all into opt-in channels with a limit (too much stress). apart from the meta wg, they should have 5 project limits to work on those many projects.
    - support team and dream journal members can manage to see all channels
    - **vedanth:** we need to be considerate of the dream journal people so each project leaders will serve as diplomats and give updates to the dream journal people
- **arath**: you can start with 3 topics of interest to see if you like it
- **jae-hee:** getting in contact with all the inactive builders
- consolidate more project communication on documents rather than discord
- our micro plug-in kit is SO BIG IT’S OVERWHELMING we need to have a more human touch to it
- how do 5 people on this call cover 41 people?
    - people on the call: arath, arman, jae-hee, vedanth, emmani
    - more ppl we can ask: aisha, amanda, ahyun, angelina
- less focus on content creation
- content precision > content volume
- julia will take care of decluttering by the end of 3 weeks...
- **vedanth:** we rotate groups on tasks for people to see what they like and are good at
- **arman:** wg coordinators can make sure that members don’t do too many tasks but wg coordinator can’t be centralized
- **arath:** have limit of contributions “oh that person will probabaly be better at it, bye!”
- **vedanth:** feeling off when builders are asked when she felt left out
    - **jae-hee:** what about we imitate geese flying in an arrow, the wg coordinator is a niche that is supplemented periodically by different people in the wg group
- **arath:** to prevent centralization of wg coordinator, the wg members hold the coordinator accountable.
- **arman:** usually people think they get included via recommendation or asking to take a task.
- **arath:** dming is better to not feel called out
- **vedanth:** we can suggest privately than outright asking in public
- **vedanth:** if already centralized in phase 1, how much more centralized will we be?
- **Arath**: Finds “You-Shaped-Hole” RIP ARATH.
- **Arman**: Decentralizes footwear ✨
- **vedanth:** use jae-hee’s presentation to introduce web3 + dreamdao to CU
- **Madhav:** build better system for task and project managment

## Action Items

start a table with all builders

find 1:1 sync using community survey questions as framework and type notes
Rundown: We’re gonna email our inactive builders to help get them back in the Dream DAO vibe if they wish! We’ve out around 5-6 reacher-outers each of whom will take a couple inactive builders and have syncs with them and get them back in the Dream DAO vibe (shoutout Jae-Hee for this)

- Note: the “?” means that they’re aren’t exactly plugged in or inactive. Basically a gray area
- Note: Since most of these people are inactive, it might be a good idea to redirect them to the [Community Health Survey](https://dreamdaohealth.paperform.co/)
- Note: the “?” means that they’re aren’t exactly plugged in or even inactive.

## Questions that we’re asking the builders when we have syncs w them!

- Ask some stuff abt them first bc this doesn’t have to be “purely business”
- What got you interested in joining the Dream DAO
- (To get to know them better)What are your thoughts on the Dream DAO’s vision to build a solarpunk future?
- (If you have previously engaged with the community) What are your favorite ways to plug in. 
(If they have been completely inactive) what stuff sounds interesting to you?
- Have you made any connections/friends through Dream DAO?
- Can we do anything else to help you get plugged in?
