# Decide whether we have another NFT Drop

🎯**Goals:**

1. To do a second NFT drop on May 30th (national water a flower day).  
2. The Dream DAO is powered by Civics Unplugged. CU is all about growing and bringing in new community members and it would be great for the Dream DAO to take those learnings and put them into practice. 
3. To take Dream DAO to the next level. Great people want in and we are keeping them out.
