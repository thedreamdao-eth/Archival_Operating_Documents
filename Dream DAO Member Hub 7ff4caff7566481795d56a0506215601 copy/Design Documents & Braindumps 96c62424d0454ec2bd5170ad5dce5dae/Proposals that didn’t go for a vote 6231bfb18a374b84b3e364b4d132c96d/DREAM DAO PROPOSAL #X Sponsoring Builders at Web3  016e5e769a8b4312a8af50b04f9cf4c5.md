💡**Description:**

Overview 

- The Dream DAO will partner with organizations to financially sponsor Builders at web3 conferences.
    - The Dream DAO will sponsor additional costs of up to $500 USD per Builder.

Eligibility 

- Builders are eligible to attend [these conferences].
- By default, only Builders 18 and older will be eligible to attend unless the sponsor organization provides chaperones and legal guidance. International Builders are eligible.

Selection 

- The number of Builders selected per conference depends on how many spots the partner organization can sponsor.
- Each Builder who wants to attend will write a proposal (using this template) and the DAO will use ranked-choice voting to select the attendees.
    - Every Builder who attends a conference will be required to co-host a Learning Together reflecting after, but in their proposal they will outline what other unique value they will provide (a new resource, contribution, idea, etc).

Support

- For each Builder, a Dream DAO Champion will serve as a guide. The Champion will help the Builder make the most out of the conference, and the two will meet in-person at least once per day.
- Before the conference, there will be training and jam sessions to help Builders to make the most out of the conference.
