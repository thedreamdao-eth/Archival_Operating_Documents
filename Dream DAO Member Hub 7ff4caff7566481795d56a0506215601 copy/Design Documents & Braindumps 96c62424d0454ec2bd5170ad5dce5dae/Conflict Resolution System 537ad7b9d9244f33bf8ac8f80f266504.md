Contributor(s): Jae-Hee Bae, Arman / Karl, Arman/Karl :), Madison Adams, Aishah

# In a nutshell!

### What conflicts are we addressing?

1. **Task-based :** Involves intervention of Self + the DAO Council
2. **Status-based:** Involves intervention of Self + the CRC (Conflict Resolution Council)
3. **Relationship-based:** Involves intervention of Self + the CRC

### The Conflict Resolution Council

CRC comprises of three neutral champions who volunteer to resolve **Relationship** and  **Status** based conflicts in the DAO, and are stewards for creating ‘The Conflict Resolution and Reflection Toolkit for the Self’

### The process

1. Setting up council before Season 2’s beginning
2. Prepping a draft of CR + Reflection Toolkit of the Self
3. Circulating it within the community for further and final inputs for the second season
4. Setting up the form and announcement drafts for Dream Journal and Emails
5. Reviewing the form responses on a regular basis

### The Form

A form that records about the conflict and intended resolution out of the same; open to all — Builders, Champions, and Friends of the DAO. Questions will include:

1. Describe the conflict from your perspective
2. Try describing the same conflict from the other person’s perspective
3. Have you tried using the self conflict-resolution toolkit before filling out the form?
    1. How do you think we can help resolve the conflict?
    2. If not, the please check out this (link in the toolkit) and feel free to reach out to (mention Council Members’ emails / discord tags) later if you still feel to.
4. What is your intended outcome out of this process?
    1. Best friends / Friends / Peers / Colleagues initially but expect to be 
        1. best friends back again
        2. just friends
        3. just colleagues / peers
5. Is there something else you wish to tell us about?

### What happens after the form’s submitted?

This is something the council should brainstorm upon and figure out!

# What happens if there’s conflict within the CRC?

1. While the Stewards can step up, but this is very unlikely but worth thinking about

# Next Steps-

Connect Oliver’s refined braindump with the existing draft and then-

Sending out the Murmur Proposal for further inputs by the entire community

After it gets approved, we create a form to get volunteers for the Council

Council can further steward the toolkit and the form needed for getting inputs on certain conflicts
