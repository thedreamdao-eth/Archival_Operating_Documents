Relevant point of contact at partner org,jinnyboi#5629
How long you’ve known this point of contact - why you trust them,"I trust them because they have similar partnerships with MetaAngels (how I got to know them in the first place), Curious Addys’, Trading Club, and Oni Squad. 
They also told me they received funding support from OpenSea which gives them more credibility. 
Then they’re collecting live feedback ab the project, so I think they really care ab its state and its future (they interviewed me ab it, too!)"
What they want to give us,"1. Free access to the beta of http://shil.me platform for all SkywalkerZ HODLers
2. All premium features
3. Maybe some custom Dream DAO wallpapers / frames for the NFTs (will ask them ab it)"
What they want in return,Twitter post shill of their project + Our discord announcement ab it
Why this is relevant to Dream DAO’s goals and potentially deserves a redirection of resources,"1. It seems like they will grow pretty fast because of the partnerships and funding they secure, it will be good for the DAO members to be the OGs already on the way when they blow up!
2. It will expand the network of Dream DAO, esp. good if they become more popular (because of how many people they’ll cover - they plan to be web3-wide) 
3. It is our way to plug http://shil.me into working with social impact orgs more (sort of like greenpilling).
4. And it’s obviously cool to make your own customized NFT board with links to your twitter and discord (sort of like linktree)
"
Relevant dates,if we vote fast enough it can be done by June 7 or earlier
Anything else you want to add,"They are also hiring a dev intern and a marketing intern, so it may be an option for some DAO members to plug in and help build their platform!
