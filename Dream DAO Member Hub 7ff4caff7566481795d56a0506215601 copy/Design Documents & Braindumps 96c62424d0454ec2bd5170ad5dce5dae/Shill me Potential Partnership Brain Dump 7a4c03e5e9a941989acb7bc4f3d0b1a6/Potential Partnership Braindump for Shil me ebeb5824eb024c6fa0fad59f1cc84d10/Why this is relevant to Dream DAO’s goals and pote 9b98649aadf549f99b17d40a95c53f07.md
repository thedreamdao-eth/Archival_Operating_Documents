# Why this is relevant to Dream DAO’s goals and potentially deserves a redirection of resources

Tentative answer: 1. It seems like they will grow pretty fast because of the partnerships and funding they secure, it will be good for the DAO members to be the OGs already on the way when they blow up!
2. It will expand the network of Dream DAO, esp. good if they become more popular (because of how many people they’ll cover - they plan to be web3-wide) 
3. It is our way to plug http://shil.me into working with social impact orgs more (sort of like greenpilling).
4. And it’s obviously cool to make your own customized NFT board with links to your twitter and discord (sort of like linktree)
