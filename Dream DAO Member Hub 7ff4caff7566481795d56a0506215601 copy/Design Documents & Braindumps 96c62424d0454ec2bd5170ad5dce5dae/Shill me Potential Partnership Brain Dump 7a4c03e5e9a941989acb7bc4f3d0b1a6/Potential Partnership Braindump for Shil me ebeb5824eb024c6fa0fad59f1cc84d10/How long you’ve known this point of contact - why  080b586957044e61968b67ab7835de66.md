# How long you’ve known this point of contact - why you trust them

Tentative answer: I trust them because they have similar partnerships with MetaAngels (how I got to know them in the first place), Curious Addys’, Trading Club, and Oni Squad. 
They also told me they received funding support from OpenSea which gives them more credibility. 
Then they’re collecting live feedback ab the project, so I think they really care ab its state and its future (they interviewed me ab it, too!)
