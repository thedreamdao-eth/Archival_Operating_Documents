Tags: Community, Docufine, Productivity
Done for now?: No
Owner (default = Gary): Governance WG
(planned)
Urgent?: Yes

- **TOP PRIORITY: Define clear cut leaders with clear responsibilities and compensation**
    - solidifying Gary’s and Madison’s role for season 2
    - have clear payment scheme for working group leadership approved in leadup to working group leadership elections
        - there is one clear leader of each working group (scrap the idea of a champion co-leading, or at least the champion is only an advisor)
- keep doing community hangouts
