# Establish and define the Dream DAO Leadership Council

Tags: Community, Productivity
Done for now?: Yes
Notes: Actual name TBD

Would be comprised of the DAO Steward, DAO Coordinator, the Working Group Leads, and the Champion advisors to the Working Group.

So many decisions in the DAO need high context of DAO activities, which we canâ€™t expect the average member to have. This council would be in charge of the decision making process for trans-working group matters.
Urgent?: Yes
