# Are there co-coordinators for a working group?

Gary tentative answer: Probably. But maybe the Builder is the lead coordinator, and the Champion is the supporting coordinator?

There needs to be clear line of accountability.
Other tentative answers: Karl: It depends upon each working group. Some like governance or partnerships can benefit by having co-coordinators, while others. such as Documentation, may not need co-coordinators. I feel that coordinators need to be more of facilitators ensuring pluralistic and meaningful contribution than being a part of every initiative of their working group :))

Or as we already have a council, I feel we may not need to have co-coordinators
