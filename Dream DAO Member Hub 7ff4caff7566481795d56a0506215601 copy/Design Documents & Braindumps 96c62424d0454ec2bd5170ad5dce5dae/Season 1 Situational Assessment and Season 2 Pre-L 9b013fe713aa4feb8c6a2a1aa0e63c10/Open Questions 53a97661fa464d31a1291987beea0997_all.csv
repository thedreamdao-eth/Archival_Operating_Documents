Open question,Gary tentative answer,Other tentative answers
Are all Working Group Coordinators paid the same?,,"amanda: yes, why not?
Karl: +1"
Are there co-coordinators for a working group?,"Probably. But maybe the Builder is the lead coordinator, and the Champion is the supporting coordinator?

There needs to be clear line of accountability.","Karl: It depends upon each working group. Some like governance or partnerships can benefit by having co-coordinators, while others. such as Documentation, may not need co-coordinators. I feel that coordinators need to be more of facilitators ensuring pluralistic and meaningful contribution than being a part of every initiative of their working group :))

Or as we already have a council, I feel we may not need to have co-coordinators"
"If there is a Champion co-coordinator, is the Champion paid? If they are paid, is it the same as the Builder co-coordinator?",,"Karl: I feel they should be paid, it is just that the medium of payment can be Eth smth, not sure"
What tools should we be using that we aren’t using yet?,Coordinape for working group stipend distribution?,
Is every working group still needed? How do we evaluate this?,"I think we can kill the Meta working group. The only Meta group/person needed is the Coordination Lead

Karl +1: We dont need a group to coordinate among different working groups, so yes!","Karl +1: We don’t need the Meta group to coordinate among different working groups as we are planning out a Dream DAO council, so yes!"
How can we get a new stock of who is interested in what working group?,Make everyone re-up on their commitment to different working groups and make every working group have their own expectations,"Karl: Sending out Weekly updates to working group members, and coordinator should have the role of meeting them via chat or live to stay updated abt the same"
