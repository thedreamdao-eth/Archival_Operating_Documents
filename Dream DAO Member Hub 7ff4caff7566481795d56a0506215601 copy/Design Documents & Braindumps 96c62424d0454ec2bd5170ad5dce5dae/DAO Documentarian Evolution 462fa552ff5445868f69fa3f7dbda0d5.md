Summary?: This brain dump focuses on updating the DAO Documentarian role according to the current Twitter strategy.

The previous role description lacked clarity on some important aspects of the role, this soon-to-be proposal exists to formalize the requirements and bring this role up-to-date with our current, more agile Twitter strategy.

### **New role description:**

**Responsibilities:**

- Write every recap thread for Learning Together (can attend live or watch recording)
    - Post threads in the Documentarian hub for the Social Media Coordinator to post
        - Post them *no longer than 5 days* after the LT session
- Content to produce:
    - An engaging thread that summarizes the LT session events
    - 1-2 interesting quotes from the host speaker
    - A visual screenshot from the session (this can be of an interesting slide, ideally including the host and audience if agreed with them during the session by the LT session facilitator. The LT facilitator will ask that anyone not willing to have themselves captured notify the host in DMs or the session chat. In this case, they can be blurred or the image can capture only the slides)

**Details:**

- $20/hour, $150 max
