- **Why are you interested in Devcon Bogotá? 🤩**
    
    I have always found technology interesting. Even at the web3conf in Goa, I particularly liked all of the tech-focused talks. Hence, I'm very excited to attend a conference that is primarily focused on the tech side of web3. As I have recently forayed into web3 specific development, I'm very excited to attend Devcon!
    
- **How would the Dream DAO Community benefit from your participation? 🎊**
    
    [I suggest that you read my answers to the next two questions first and then come back to this one]As a builder who leans towards tech and development, I'll be learning about lots of new technologies there and could bring that knowledge back to the DAO to share with other members. Since I plan to integrate the bot with DAO operations (like POAP distribution), I would be able to meet a lot of devs who could help me and give feedback about my code. This would result in a better bot for the DAO!
    
- **Why do you consider yourself unique and why do you think this experience would benefit your career/personal growth? 🌈**
    
    I have begun exploring web3 specific tech development only very recently. I have had experience with programming, but none of it has been web3 specific. I think that going to a dev-focused, tech-heavy conference like Devcon will really help me learn a lot.From 8th to 11th September, I will be going to Solana Hacker House, New Delhi. This means that Devcon will be happening at the perfect time for me, and the conversations I will have with other developers will be even more impactful and meaningful.
    
- **What contributions have you made to Dream DAO in season two? 👨‍🚀**
    
    I have been a regular attendee of Governance WG meetings and have contributed to various discussions (most recently the merit system) that happen there. At web3conf, Goa, I spread the word about Dream DAO. At Goa, we identified many potential Champions who might join the DAO soon. When Season 2 was just about to start, I volunteered to send DM reminders to all the members of the DAO to renew their membership. Sending those DMs made me realise that many similarly tedious and repetitive tasks could be automated. Discussions with other members made me conclude that a Discord bot will be very useful for the DAO. Hence, I have started developing one. It is quite basic at the moment, but I expect to add some QoL features this week and deploy it on the server after that. You can see the source code on the following GitHub repo https://github.com/Lewis-Base/D3Bot

    I have been in the web3 space for 10 months already and it has been amazing, but after interning during this summer I realized that I want to meet those people that are building this amazing ReFi space we are involved in, hear their stories and knowledge in person, experience the whole web3 x social impact in real life and feel the energy!
    
- **How would the Dream DAO Community benefit from your participation? 🎊**
    
    I am able to create content, posts, stories, tweets, learning artifacts, and blogging; I am do think I am a great companionship, and I would love to bring support and trust for the younger builders attending the conference.
    
- **Why do you consider yourself unique and why do you think this experience would benefit your career/personal growth? 🌈**
    
    I think that going to Devcon will allow me to discover more of the ethereum applications in research, media, and art, as well as build networking this intersection. I really want to remain in blockchain when attending college but I need to make sense of my careers goals (media and communication) with web3 first, and I am trying to get that for now. I hope Devcon helps me to get creative about what to do with those passions together.
    
- **What contributions have you made to DreamDAO in season two? 👨‍🚀**
    
    I represented Dream DAO as an explorer in my internship with Celo's Climate Collective, I am also assigned to deliever a interview with a Celo leader. I am beggining at the NEAR WG as a fellow this month and I hope to contribute more in the coming weeks now that I have more free time due to the fact that my internship is done!

    When I went to ETHMexico, I realized I was way behind everyone else. I could only support teams but not participate in them due to my limited knowledge. While I still connected with people, I lacked activity during the event. But when I heard about Devcon Bogotá and what it is about, I realized I could learn from this conference. They have different talks for different professions, including UX/UI design which is what I want to study when not in college
    
- **How would the Dream DAO Community benefit from your participation? 🎊**
    
    Members will have the opportunity to join an LT session related to what I learnt during my stay in Bogota. I will also be more trained in web3, which can faciliate the creation of ideas and increase my participation in DAO areas that are more technical.
    
- **Why do you consider yourself unique and why do you think this experience would benefit your career/personal growth? 🌈**
    
    My willingness to learn and my extroverted traits help with my growth path. I try to participate everywhere I can to learn more and enhance my marketing career at college. I feel there will be a lot to do when it comes to marketing and web3 so I don't want to miss this opportunity! There were many marketers at ETHMexico and I'm excited to study and learn more to come stronger to the next ETH event I can attend!
    
- **What contributions have you made to DreamDAO in season two? 👨‍🚀**
    
    Currently, I am the community building WG lead. With the help of the CB team, we pull out projects to keep and/or increase engagement in our community! This Sunday we will be working on two key results to end the month!

- **Why are you interested in Devcon Bogotá? 🤩**
    
    I feel very interested in Devcon Bogotá because since I entered Dream Dao I have always wanted to learn about what is done, about web3, but above all, I consider that this would be an unforgettable experience in which I could develop my capabilities and could understand in a better way how to contribute with my skills to web3 and therefore to Dream Dao. I believe that being able to have the opportunity to travel to this type of event such as Devcon Bogotá would help me to know, learn and understand much better what my purpose is within the DAO.
    
- **How would the Dream DAO Community benefit from your participation? 🎊**
    
    I believe that the Dream Dao Community would benefit from my participation in Devcon Bogotá since I would be committed to making the most of the opportunity to be part of this event, I would take full advantage of all the resources and the different activities within Devcon and I could continue developing and potentiating all my abilities, as well as being able to learn and develop new skills that I consider could benefit the Dream Dao Community in the future as well as enrich me personally, but especially in the sphere of our community, since I would obtain confidence and knowledge that in the future I am sure would benefit our entire community.
    
- **Why do you consider yourself unique and why do you think this experience would benefit your career/personal growth? 🌈**
    
    Personally, I have always considered myself a unique person, because since I was a child I have always been a committed and dedicated person, also I have always been a curious child and I always want to try new things, personally, challenges have always seemed like a way to prove to myself that I can and that my abilities are enough to meet my goals and objectives and I firmly believe that being a person who never gives up and who always fights despite the results makes me a unique person. In the same way, I consider that being able to live the experience of Devcon Bogotá would benefit me in many aspects, one of them is that I could learn from this new opportunity, I could develop my leadership, communication, and learning abilities and I could learn new skills along the way, in the career growth field, this type of activities would help me a lot to develop in the area of web3 and acquire more experience throughout the time.
    
- **What contributions have you made to DreamDAO in season two? 👨‍🚀**
    
    During season two of Dream Dao I consider that I have contributed both personally and to the community, first of all, since I arrived at Dream Dao I have always been a person with great enthusiasm and eagerness to learn, so I have tried to make the time to be able to attend the vast majority of the Learning Together Sessions, in the same way, I have supported my Gatherings team in different tasks, from attending the respective weekly sessions of our team as having contributed to the application of this experience of Devcon Bogotá preparing, together with the help of my colleagues, the information packet for this trip. Although I do not have much experience in Dream Dao, I feel that I am a very enthusiastic and curious person, as well as a very committed person, so I have no doubt that I will continue to contribute to the community in the future.
    
- **Anything else you would like to add? 🙌**
    
    The only thing I would like to say is to thank you in advance for allowing me to apply for this great experience and I hope I can be one of the lucky ones to go to Devcon Bogotá.

- **Why are you interested in Devcon Bogotá? 🤩**
    
    Being a high school graduate who will start college next January, I know that Devcon is the one event I need to attend to delve into the Ethereum community and learn about it to fuel my curiosity and thinking in my own quest to learn and innovate simultaneously. Being a person who loves to exchange diverse perspectives and ideate together, one of the most important things I know I will accomplish by attending this event is meet new people from around the world and make great connections with fellow builders and enthusiasts. Further, Devcon being technology focused but having vast applications in the field of research, economy, art, community, social impact, etc., I will explore the intersections of different disciplines and understand how Ethereum fuels all kinds of builders, and find my place in the community.
    
- **How would the Dream DAO Community benefit from your participation? 🎊**
    
    I feel I can benefit the Dream DAO community by learning from this amazing event! I’ve had the opportunity to meet and work with some amazing people who are exploring the web3 space and also people who have established themselves in it. The Dream DAO has shown me how the global web3 community functions and being an active member of the DAO, I look forward to joining the global Ethereum community in real life. My primary aim is to find and nurture meaningful partnerships and connections with other individuals and organizations for our DAO while also talking about what we have to offer as a web3 x social impact DAO! Further, I aim share my Devcon experience with everyone in the DAO through the Learning Artifact I make as well as photos/videos and discussions on topics that I learn from Devcon. This will help our DAO find some amazing partners while also gain more recognition. On an internal level, I will be able to bring Devcon 6 to everyone in the DAO with my Learning Artifact as well as other ideas.
    
- **Why do you consider yourself unique and why do you think this experience would benefit your career/personal growth? 🌈**
    
    I have a unique standing- having diverse interests and thriving at their intersection, and I know that adding web3 to this Venn diagram will add more elements to my knowledge set, resulting in forming an improved version of myself. Attending Devcon will give me a global exposure to a diverse set of people and a vast number of organizations which will help me gain as well as upgrade various skills that will lead to an exponential growth in both my career and personality.I’ve always been interested in a particular topic as well as its application in the real world, and being a curious person who loves to analyse and ideate, this experience will allow me to innovate with my fellow builders of the DAO. This will be my first real-life experience, and it’ll help me increase my output by harnessing my potential to the fullest.
    
- **What contributions have you made to DreamDAO in season two? 👨‍🚀**
    
    I’ve tried to be very active and my primary contribution has been to learn from it! I’ve tried to do what the DAO aims to do and have had an amazing experience till now. I compiled a learning page- “Intro to the web3 universe” for everyone in the DAO to introduce web3 from scratch. I hosted a S2 Builder session to get to know new builders, ways to be more involved, basics of transactions, WG experiences and other discussions which also acted as a community-building session. I’ve been active in my working groups and attended all meetings. I recently created a Conference Training document for Partnerships. Also, I’ve connected with builders and had great discussions with them- answering their queries on transactions as well as learning from them. I’ve also met some of our champions- Saf, Carl, Jon and Harry and talked to them about my ideas for the DAO!

    After getting accepted to Denison University and graduating high school recently, I will start my academic journey at Denison in January 2023 as a spring-start student. This has given me a ‘gap-semester’ to do anything before starting college and attending Devcon 6 will be the perfect opportunity for me. As someone who has pursued various activities, I’ve always been a very involved person and I look forward to being an involved member of the web3 community, taking full advantage of my gap semester to explore, learn more and continue to be involved!

- **Why are you interested in Devcon Bogotá? 🤩**
    
    Devcon covers a multitude of topics whether someone is experienced or just starting out in Web3. As someone who is passionate about arts and social impact(amongst many other things) , the few things that will be covered that really stuck out to me were Opportunity & Global Impact, UX & Design. Opportunity and Global Impact interests me because it talks about sustainability, P2P finance and impact of NFTs which is important if in the future we want to use Web3 to empower and nourish marginalised communities by improving existing infrastructures or by developing new systems. UX and design will allow me to tap into my creative side. So overall, my interest in Devcon Bogota purely stems from the ability to explore different interests and to cultivate my existing passions.
    
- **How would the Dream DAO Community benefit from your participation? 🎊**
    
    I believe that I can be a good representation for Dream DAO because of their social impact values. I’ve always had a variety of interests and believed that I can be a versatile figure and as I consistently serve every community I’m a part of, I also try to find ways to improve it. Dream DAO is no different. As the Web3 x Social impact scene grows, I believe that there is always room for improvement and that there is so much that can be done in terms of the potential that Dream DAO has and I believe that I can be a contributor to that. Whether it’s striving for partnerships, identifying an untouched niche or improving our existing ecosystems, I believe that Dream DAO can benefit from my participation.
    
- **Why do you consider yourself unique and why do you think this experience would benefit your career/personal growth? 🌈**
    
    Being able to participate in Devcon would pave the path of my career trajectory as I get a glimpse of the different facets of Web3. I’ll get to network with many people and understand their field and story on a more personal level. Coming from a community and family that has the ability to flourish if empowered, I believe that I have the responsibility to carry the torch and move forward and being able to find myself in the Web3 space will allow me to do just that. I will get to collaborate with other people and have the irl experience of networking as so far, I’ve only been limited to the online space so this experience will allow me to move past the online space and maybe also give me a sense of independence to a certain extent(since I’ve never travelled alone!).
    
- **What contributions have you made to DreamDAO in season two? 👨‍🚀**
    
    I’m currently part of the Gatherings and Community building working groups and so far I have been able to attend nearly all the meetings and stay up to date with progress and projects of the groups. I’ve worked with another builder on a document that outlines the essence of Learning Artefacts and what it entails. One of the projects I’m most proud of so far is helping facilitate the Learning Together session that talked about the fundamentals of Web3 x Social Impact. I got to do extensive research and present one of my favourite Web3 x Social Impact projects(CowgirlDAO). I’ve also facilitated and helped organise the Season 2 community hangout where I helped answer questions and got to meet new builders.

    Just hearing the word "Devcon" makes my skin crawl haha. I'm sure Devcon Bogota is a great event for the Dream DAO community and especially for me, since I'll be able to learn new things about the ecosystem and make new connections (there will be tech stack, protocols and UX/Design conferences woohoo 🥳).When I was at ETHMexico (less than a week ago), I was amazed with all the people that were there, I learned from them and I realized that I want to go further and and level up my career in web3; that's why I'm very interested in attending Devcon Bogota with Dream DAO.
    
- **How would the Dream DAO Community benefit from your participation? 🎊**
    
    Dream DAO would benefit enormously! I could make Learning Artifacts, LTs, make new connections to attract new champions, builders, partners, guest speakers to our DAO. It would skyrocket the Dream DAO name (proof of this is that at ETHMexico all Dream DAO members who went, including myself, won bounties and Dream DAO got noticed)... will the same thing happen at Devcon 🤨?
    
- **Why do you consider yourself unique and why do you think this experience would benefit your career/personal growth? 🌈**
    
    I am a person who loves to meet new people, make new connections, learn something new and help in whatever is needed...I think this makes me unique no? haha🤨Going to Devcon would grow my network and knowledge about web3 x social impact. I'm sure in case of going my growth would be unimaginable and my desire to want more and help more in Dream DAO and outside would be immense 🤩
    
- **What contributions have you made to DreamDAO in season two? 👨‍🚀**
    
    I'm Gatherings WG Lead, I've distributed POAPs, introduced new people to the Dream DAO discord server and have made 4 people potential champions and 2 already want to be champs woohoo 🙌!!!!I've also participated in most of the LTs and co-hosted two meetings with the new builders of season 2 to help them get more involved in Dream DAO.

    An Etherum event that can change your life and way of thinking, with an amazing agenda and program, with topics that fit perfectly with you✨ ; that's how I describe Devcon Bogota for me. I’m sure that this event will bring builders of all kinds, so the atmosphere that will be created during those days will be amazing! I look forward to connecting with the communities that will be attending. Global Impact, Etherum's Vision and cryptoeconomy is the key focus point I'm looking for to get a deep dive into web3 and this event will cover all these topics and many more! All this with blooming with the interest I have, from the enthusiasm to learn and meet new people with fresh thoughts in this ecosystem, makes me one hundred percent sure that this event fits with me and the personal learning outcomes I hope to get 👩‍🚀.
    
- **How would the Dream DAO Community benefit from your participation? 🎊**
    
    Since I started my experience in Dream DAO I have realized the unity that exists between all builders, so I can enrich the community sharing my experience in a podcats, video call, written article or even a LT where all the builders who have gone can share and we can have a 360-degree involvement for everyone in the community. Also during the event I will be able to meet people who were already in the ecosystem and meet future champions or hosts in some LT. I will also be able to invite the young people I managed to connect with at the event to join our new season and share with them my experience so far. And finally, I hope to start spreading the web3 and Dream DAO within my school with quick talks and increasingly scale the impact we are having.
    
- **Why do you consider yourself unique and why do you think this experience would benefit your career/personal growth? 🌈**
    
    Thanks to past projects that I have developed, courses and communities in which I have been, have led me to be a very active person, trying to learn more at every moment, this has formed me so far giving me tools and skills to adapt to new changes, making me a unique person, that is why this experience will help me to apply all this in web3. At this point in my life I have a defined life purpose in social impact (education and gender equality), where I already had a defined career, but it was since I got fully involved in DreamDAO that I have questioned if the career I had previously chosen would be the best for the cause I want to focus on, because I have learned from experts in the ecosystem that have led me to renew my ideas. So, this experience would help me solve this dilemma and change my life completely! 	This event will also help me to take to the next level the social projects I have now, impacting on a large scale within my country and the world, hoping to learn real and effective solutions through web3 by amazing people and communities.
    
- **What contributions have you made to DreamDAO in season two? 👨‍🚀**
    
    Since I joined this new season of DreamDAO I was able to get intensely involved in the Gatherings working group. From the beginning I contributed recording the weekly sessions, besides making the respective notes in our notion platform. In the last months, we managed to select an event for the community where I contributed with the search for potential events to discuss in our meetings. And most of all I have loved being an active member in our discord community, I have attended most of the LT's we have had and team gatherings as well. Finally, I am happy to say that together with Saf, Ibtehaj and Jaynie we organized a LT where we talked about Web3 x Social Impact Fundamentals exemplifying with some projects 🙌.

    Devcon Bogota will be the first step for me as a web3 enthusiast to connect with other people that are interested in web3 as I am. I believe I can learn so much from the experts' presentations about their journey in web3 and how they overcame the obstacles they've faced.
    
- **How would the Dream DAO Community benefit from your participation? 🎊**
    
    Dream DAO can benefit from my participation through presenting the DAO in front of other DAOs, and by representing a diverse DAO with people from all over the world including the middle east.

    Imagine living 1 year in 1 week. The community, the city, culture, and knowledge are astonishing. It’s an experience for a lifetime that only going to Devcon Bogotá will proportionate. Also is symbolic for me to go to Colombia and learn the latest news related to web 3 because LATAM is historically left behind in the innovations of the world, so it's a shift, not just in mentality but culturally.
    
- **How would the Dream DAO Community benefit from your participation? 🎊**
    
    As a participant, I will learn about the contents proposed in the conference and create a learning outcome and artifact for the Dream DAO community. Record and take photos for the media team, and especially network with people spreading the Dream DAO values and missions between every person that I talk to so we can get more champions, Learning Together speakers, and contributors. At my last experience representing Dream DAO in the event I did exactly this, so I will be more experienced in the Devcon Bogotá events.

- **Why are you interested in Devcon Bogotá? 🤩**
    
    I think that Devcon Bogota is one of the most highly anticipated Web 3 conferences of this year. There will be a lot of key personalities within the Web 3 space giving talks about different fields of Blockchain at the conference. I think to be a part of something this significant would be a great learning opportunity for me. Devcon will also give me a platform to meet like-minded builders who wanna contribute to the ecosystem by being a part of something socially impactful and regenerative. To think that I would get to meet so many talented builders passionate about Web 3 is just inspiring. I also believe that it could widen my knowledge about the space, different protocols and Web 3 in general.
    
- **How would the Dream DAO Community benefit from your participation? 🎊**
    
    Something I have always loved doing ever since I was a teenager is to teach. I think if I get to go to a huge conference like Devcon, I will want to share my learnings with the community. I can do so by hosting hangout sessions, AMA sessions and just letting the DAO know that they can reach out to me and I will always try my best to guide them well. I can also scout for guest speakers who can be a part of our Learning Together sessions. I can also look for potential partners who may be interested in funding Dream DAO which will enable us to onboard more builders in the next season. I can also document the whole conference in the form of a video as well as an article that can be shared within the DAO and on our twitter page which will help the ecosystem prosper even more.
    
- **Why do you consider yourself unique and why do you think this experience would benefit your career/personal growth? 🌈**
    
    Something I genuinely find unique about myself and that I am grateful for is the ability to adapt and get along well with people. My dad serves in the Indian Army, so when I was growing up, we had to move to a new state every 2 years. This meant that I have to learn about a new state, a new language, a new culture and understand people from different backgrounds. I think this shaped my personality and my character in such a way that I don't find it hard to socialize with people or get along with them. This has always turned out to be advantageous in my life so far. I think the ability to learn something new very quickly is a skill that a lot of organizations value. And I personally believe that if this is channeled in the right way, I can excel in life when it comes to my career.
    
- **What contributions have you made to DreamDAO in season two? 👨‍🚀**
    
    My contributions to the DAO has been limited so far. I along with Ibtehaj, we created a simple notion page that outlines what is expected from a builder's Learning Artefact. I worked with the Gatherings Working Group to put together the necessary steps that were needed to be taken before the Devcon Bogota Trip form was sent out. I also participated in the testing of sending out the first Season 2 SkywalkerZ NFT. Something I'd like to include is my future plans for the DAO, I wanna host learning sessions for Season 2 builders who wanna understand better and learn more about Web 3 in general.
    
- **Anything else you would like to add? 🙌**
    
    Nothing in specific. I am just grateful that this opportunity was provided to us. Thank you.

    Although I may fall short on the tech side of Ethereum and web3, I'm passionate about DreamDAO's intention to foster social impact through this ecosystem. As Devcon is a place for "new Ethereum explorers" (just like me) to adventure and develop the already-existing ecosystem, I seek to learn, empower, and build decentralized systems through this opportunity. Before joining DreamDAO as a Season 2 Builder, I had a negative premature conception against block chains, turning a blind eye to its true potential. But as soon as I discovered and explored DreamDAO with the help of amazing Champions and Season 1 Builder, I broke free from that preconception to realize how much my passion aligns with the mission of block chains (specifically DreamDAO). I want to place my passion on Devcon Bogota to put it to good use in advancing my and DreamDAOs mission on social impact.
    
- **How would the Dream DAO Community benefit from your participation? 🎊**
    
    DreamDAO’s mission and my passion intersect on the word “social impact.” It may sound a bit weird, but I think that best way to explain myself is that I am the human version of DreamDAO (just like Skywalkerz). By sending me to Devcon, I believe that I can fully deliver, communicate, and empower the community and its ecosystem with DreamDAO’s vision of Ethereum and Blockchains. Moreover, I’m confident that my skills on management and engagement can truly benefit the community. For example, I always tend to be on task, be mindful of time, and get things done with quality. On the other hand, as I know my joy peaks with DreamDAO’s work, I can use that joy as the fuel to propel me towards honest and passionate effort. Furthermore, I believe that the Dream DAO community can benefit from my participation beyond Bogota. For instance, I will bring along insight to the community so that we can expand our authentic ideas from what we learned from Devcon. “Learn and Apply” is my motto and I’ll put this to use to reap the most benefits for the Dream DAO community.
    
- **Why do you consider yourself unique and why do you think this experience would benefit your career/personal growth? 🌈**
    
    I consider myself unique with the DreamDAO community because I’m a person who went from a “pessimistic critic” to an “enthusiast of blockchains.” I underwent this rather extreme transformation by “learning, then applying.” After realizing how much I align with DreamDAO’s and web3’s mission, joy helped me pave a more authentic path. Therefore, through this experience, I believe that I can open another door of realization to understand how I can put my passion for social impact to good and impactive use. My life has always been about opening doors, then entering them to adventure and discover who I am and what I can do. I believe that DreamDAO has opened the door for me by selecting me as a builder; therefore, I believe that it’s my responsibility to myself and the Dream DAO community to enter that door and explore Devcon to simultaneously shape my authentic-self and benefit the community. In terms of the professional aspect, I believe that this experience can help build my identity among the field of social impact and help people understand who I am.
    
- **What contributions have you made to DreamDAO in season two? 👨‍🚀**
    
    As a Season 2 builder, I’ve mostly spent my time exploring and learning from the community to build a fuller understanding of web3 and blockchains. But, I’ve also made major contributions as a member of the Governance and Community Building working group. For example, I lead the revamp of the merit system within the Governance WG by first and foremost getting everyone on the same page to put ideas down and develop a new system with remedies to past flaws. Additionally, I've semi-officially been named the “note taker” of the Governance WG by making major contributions to putting everything down on the record so that we don’t repeat the same mistakes and waste time. On the other hand, I’ve made some significant contributions to the Community Building WG by volunteering to take on tasks, such as working with Rashmika to develop a community evaluation survey.
