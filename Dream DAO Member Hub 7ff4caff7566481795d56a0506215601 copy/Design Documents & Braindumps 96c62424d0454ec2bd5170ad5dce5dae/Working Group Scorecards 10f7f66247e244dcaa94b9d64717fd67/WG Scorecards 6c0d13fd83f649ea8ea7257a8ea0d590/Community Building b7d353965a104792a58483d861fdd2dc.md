# Community Building

Review Month: August 2022
Review Status: In progress
Operations: The group has not met regularly or succeeded in organizing key community events.
OKR Progress: The group has set OKRs, but not made meaningful progress towards them.
Accomplishments: The group has scheduled community heartbeats to engage DAO members, but not hosted and there have been multiple attempted reschedules.
Improvement Areas: The group does not appear active or dialed into the community. There needs to be a rediscovery of the groupâ€™s essential intent and a review of OKRs.
