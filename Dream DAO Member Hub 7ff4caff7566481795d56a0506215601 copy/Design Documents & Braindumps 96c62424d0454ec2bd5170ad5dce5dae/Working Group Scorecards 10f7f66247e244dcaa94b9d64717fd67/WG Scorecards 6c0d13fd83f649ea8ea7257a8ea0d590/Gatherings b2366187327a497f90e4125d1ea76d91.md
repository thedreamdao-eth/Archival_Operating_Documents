# Gatherings

Working Group: Gatherings
Review Month: August 2022
Review Status: In progress
Operations: The group has met regularly with good turnout at most meetings.
OKR Progress: The group has set OKRs and made good progress on at least 2/5 OKRs so far.
Accomplishments: The group has provided support for Devcon planning and got the applications out.
Improvement Areas: Gatherings work is high context and it is hard to have it done by a big group. The tasks expected of this working group may be better performed through one or more recurring roles instead.
