# Web3 jargon can still remain intimidating and alienating to readers with minimal experience.

Notes: No matter how optimistic we can be around users’ eagerness to learn, if we assume that they will be able to immediately obtain jaargon fluency, we may counterproductive draw people way from further attempts at learning.
