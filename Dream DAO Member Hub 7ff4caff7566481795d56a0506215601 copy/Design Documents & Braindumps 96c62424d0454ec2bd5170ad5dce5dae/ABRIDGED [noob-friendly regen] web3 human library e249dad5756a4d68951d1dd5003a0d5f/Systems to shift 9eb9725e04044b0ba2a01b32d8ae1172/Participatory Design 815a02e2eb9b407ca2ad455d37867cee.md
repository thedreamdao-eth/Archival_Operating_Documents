# Participatory Design

How it's not serving stakeholders sufficiently: Ultimately, through all of this, we hope to onboard tons of newbies into the regen web3 movement and draw upon their unique lived experiences, background, and strengths to enrich the participatory design that must occur during the critical groundwork stage of regen web3.

We must decentralize access & participation in this space to truly live up to our vision of a regenerative future! ðŸ’š
