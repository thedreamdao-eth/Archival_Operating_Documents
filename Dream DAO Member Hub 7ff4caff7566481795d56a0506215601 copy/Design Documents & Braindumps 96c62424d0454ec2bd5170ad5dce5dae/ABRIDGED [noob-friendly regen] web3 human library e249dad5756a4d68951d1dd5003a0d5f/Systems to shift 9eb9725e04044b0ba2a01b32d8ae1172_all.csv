Systems to shift,How it's not serving stakeholders sufficiently
Public understanding of crypto,"Although “degen” motives laid the groundwork for web3, it’s time to turn this narrative around and showcase the many regenerative capabilities of wisely harnessed blockchain technologies. "
Visibility of Impact DAOs,"Without conventional methods of advertising, Impact DAOs are quite difficult to find. Most Impact DAOs signal their existence within the regen twitter insider’s jungle — not much reaches the rims of the forest. "
Personal engagements with crypto,"Through specific design choices, we want readers to have a clear sense of how they might find their niche or “you-shaped hole” in regen web3 (alongside investment, too if they’re into that, ofc!)"
Accessibility of Regen space,Regen web3 is incredibly inaccessible if not time-intensive and unlikely to occur unless you have a community to co-learn with (such as a DAO).
Language barriers of crypto,Most resources are in English.
Regen web3 traffic,"We want to bring more traffic towards this space! Not only to popularize and scale but allow for many hands to touch the fabric and integrate into the regen story! "
Approachability of web3,"Most importantly, web3 onboarding should feel comfy & approachable. It’s definitely intimidating — with the unfamiliarity, fancy words, idealism, and all. "
Participatory Design,"Ultimately, through all of this, we hope to onboard tons of newbies into the regen web3 movement and draw upon their unique lived experiences, background, and strengths to enrich the participatory design that must occur during the critical groundwork stage of regen web3.

We must decentralize access & participation in this space to truly live up to our vision of a regenerative future! 💚"
