**Current situation:** 

- Builders don’t know how to find mentors
- Champions don’t know how to find Builders to mentor, or what mentoring should look like
- Even if they do find a way to meet, it is one meeting and more or less an introduction

**What if we had a formalized mentorship system? A formalized mentorship system would:** 

- Allow Champions and Builders to connect and learn from each other on a more meaningful level
- Give Champions a clear way to consistently contribute to the Dream DAO
- Supercharge the web3 career development of Builders

**We could have a mentorship program with the following simple structure:** 

- A new cohort starting every 2 months. 2 months is long enough to go deep, but not too much of a time commitment
- Builders and Champions sign up and are matched together by the Co-stewards based on mutual interests
- The purpose of the program is to help the Builder find a meaningful path to contributing to web3. I (Madison) have had 1:1 meetings with several Builders to craft a “plan” for how they are going to progressively increase their contributions to web3. This could be more meaningfully scaled with a mentorship program. With this model…
    - **Before the program**: The Builder documents all of their current interests as they relate to web3. Could be writing, coding, marketing, operations, art - anything- even if they don’t have the skills right now. The first meeting will be dedicated to the Champion gaining an understanding of these interests and getting to know the Builder better.
    - **During the program**: The Champion will provide thoughts, resources, and connections needed for the Builder to explore different areas of interests. For example, let’s say a Builder is interested in writing. A champion might send the Builder 5 of their favorite web3 articles and encourage the Builder to write a blog post. Or, let’s say the Builder has a Dream of hosting a web3 podcast. The Champion might encourage the Builder to host a web3 discussion group in Dream DAO, and would help them craft the discussion topics.
    - **After the program**: With the knowledge and experience gained from the program, the Builder will document their main “next steps”. These are larger commitments that they know they want to take part in after the discovery from the mentorship program. Examples:
        - Enrolling in a 12-week blockchain developer course
        - Beginning the Explorers Program at a DeSci org
        - Starting a web3 podcast
- The pair would meet once every two weeks for 30 minutes. In total, they would meet 4 times. This time commitment makes sense because it does not ask too much of the Champion and most of the “work” is done independently by the Builder, the Champion is more or less an advisor.
- We could begin the first mentorship program in October to fit in one during season 2.
