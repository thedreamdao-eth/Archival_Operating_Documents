# Dream DAO Web3 Bootcamp

**Current Situation**: 

Right now when Builders join the Dream DAO, they are given very little guidance in terms of web3 education. We do a session for setting up wallets and intro to web3 x social impact, but it can still feel very intimidating entering the world of web3. We can be doing a lot more to help our new members feel educated, which will set them up for success inside and outside of the DAO. 

**Idea**: 

What if we had a “Dream DAO Bootcamp” for new Builders at the start of every season? On a high level, this would look like: 

- A 3-week introduction to web3 x social impact that provides new Builders with the foundational knowledge they need to start contributing to the DAO and web3.
- There would be a series of live and/or recorded sessions (web3 fundamentals, how DAOs operate, etc) to serve as orientation and tutorials.
- There would be a number of async tasks (setting up a wallet, minting a merit badge, voting) that act as on-chain “proof of learning”.
- Builders will be assigned to a group to learn and troubleshoot with other Builders (and the support of one experienced web3 Champion/Builder from a previous season).
- At the end of the bootcamp, Builders will get their SkywalkerZ and be able to operate as full working group and voting members of the DAO.

**Benefits to this idea**: 

- It creates some prerequisites to being a Builder, hopefully ensuring that only committed Builders with the right skills become SkywalkerZ holders and full voting members of DAO
- Builders feel more welcomed into the world of Dream DAO and web3
- Builders are better able to contribute to the DAO and web3
- More Builders are engaged in the DAO long-term because they feel more confident in their knowledge
- When the DAO/working groups are doing operational processes at the start of the season, Builders have a way to actively engage
- Adds another clear way for Champions to engage in the DAO, they can host some of the live sessions and join the group chats

**Constraints:**

- The program should take no more than 3 weeks
- The program should not require more than ~2 hours per week for a typical Builder (roughly one hour learning concepts from videos / live discussions / reading materials) and one hour doing async tasks
- The program should not cost more than $5 per participant (will likely need to do most things on an L2)
- The program should not require Builders to make a fiat to crypto deposit

**How we would create this**: 

My recommendation is that we ask one Champion and one Builder to apply to this as a bounty. 

I believe this does not qualify as a working group because: 

- **One-off task**: Just as other bounties, this is a one-off task, not a recurring responsibility. While there will always be work to be done around groups like governance and partnerships, the same can not be said about the design of a bootcamp. If we were to create a working group (and go through the long process of elections), it would be dissolved in two months.
- **Timeline**: This is something that needs to be designed relatively quickly. Working groups only contribute a couple of hours per week, and the designers of this program would need to work more hours per week for a shorter amount of time.

As a bounty, Saf (a former educator) would work with one Builder. The Builder would be paid $750 for the work. Saf would not be paid, it would be considered a part of his current responsibilities. They would apply to the role, and the Co-Stewards would review the applications and select the bootcamp survivor. 

Keeping in mind the time for this proposal to pass and the selection of the Builder, this would likely begin in October and we would expect the bootcamp to be designed and planned by the end of November, which gives the members two months to work. In early November, they would present the plan to the DAO and implement any feedback before making any final preparations for the bootcamp to start in January when new members onboard.
