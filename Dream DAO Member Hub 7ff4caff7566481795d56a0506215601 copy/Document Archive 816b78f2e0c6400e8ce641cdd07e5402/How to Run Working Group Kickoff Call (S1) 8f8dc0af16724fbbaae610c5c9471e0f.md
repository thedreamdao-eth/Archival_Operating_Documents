### **Pre-meeting:**

[template for the notes/agenda](How%20to%20Run%20Working%20Group%20Kickoff%20Call%20(S1)%208f8dc0af16724fbbaae610c5c9471e0f/template%20for%20the%20notes%20agenda%206cf829141e83462fb265cce2222b2f45.md)

1. Send out calendar invite with agenda + required pre-reading (see Allison’s suggestion for that)

1. See if Gary can make the meeting - he can be the default facilitator
    1. If Gary can’t make it - find a Champion who is comfortable facilitating this

### **During meeting:**

- Screenshare notes page
- Go through each section until people have mostly said what they want to say - take notes as people are talking (you may lend this role to anyone else if you feel uncomfortable)

### **After meeting:**

- Create an event page in this page: [https://www.notion.so/cucrew/0612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda?v=a225f2eab530479e9e31ba01af03c538](../Evergreen%20Documents%20976d2984e99f4146b4283457a2303a7c/Evergreen%20Documents%20Database%20db1ccc6322ae474dba4b59d6b687d080/Dream%20DAO%20Events%205eb4b870ef7643a4986aa5b6f0fdb3b8/Dream%20DAO%20Events%200612daaf307c45b988a66d425cab4dda.md)
