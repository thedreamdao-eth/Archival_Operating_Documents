Our plan for rolling out the NFTs has so far been more or less "enable people to purchase up to 2,030 NFTs starting at a certain date, with some promo of the NFT launch starting 1-2 weeks before."

This rollout plan doesn't make sense for CU for a few reasons:

1. We don't have a following of NFT traders (and even if we did, are these the right kinds of people we want to have a say in our DAO?)
    1. We could pay people to promote the launch, but that's not likely going to yield long-term holders and the organic traction we need
2. It is very risky to bring in dozens/hundreds of strangers into a community‚Äîwhere we haven't established a base culture/norms.

**So what might we do instead?**

> Basic Pitch: Right now, there's about $25,000 in funding that we hope to allocate through this Beta, and would love you to be among the first people to test our DAO.
> 

I think it makes sense for us to bring in "beta testers" in phases, where we only launch a new phase of recruitment...

- when we've seen that we at CU can handle the number people brought in at the previous phase
- when other success metrics for the phase are met

In the same way that the Civics 2030 community has evolved over time through the result of onboarding of new cohorts of Fellowship graduates and many intentional experiments spearheaded by the CU team, this is the way the Dream DAO must grow.

*Also, we need to make sure we frame joining the Dream DAO as an OPPORTUNITY to build the future with DOPE people (and not just an investment/donation). Friends with Benefits DAO does this EXTREMELY well: [https://www.fwb.help/join](https://www.fwb.help/join)*

## What Should Grow Across Phases:

<aside>
‚ÑπÔ∏è What might indicate we are ready to "unlock" the next Phase? What metrics might approximate the size of the snowball we are trying to construct?

</aside>

- Twitter Following
- Discord Membership
- SkywalkerZ sold
- Number of people engaged in the DAO per week
- Amount of people talking about SkywalkerZ or the Dream DAO
- Number of very influential people who have joined DAO as members
- Size of Dream DAO treasury

## Open Questions:

- Do we say in public media that we're ultimately selling 2030 skywalkerz from the beginning‚Äî or do we keep quiet on our ultimate plan?
    - Obviously we would share our whitepaper with all the details so they know where we're going with all this, but maybe we're more secretive in public
