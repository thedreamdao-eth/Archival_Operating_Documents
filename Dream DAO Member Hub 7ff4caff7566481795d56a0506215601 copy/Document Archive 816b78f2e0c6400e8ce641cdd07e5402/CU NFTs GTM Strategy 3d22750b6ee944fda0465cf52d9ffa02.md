The reason we launched the program is because NFTs open a revolutionary new path to give, allows a whole new segment of wealth to fund the next generation of leaders. 

Another benefit of the program, is it will bring significant funding to our cause. This is because NFTs have the power to move massive amounts of capital to organizations and missions like ours. 

Here's what's next: In Q4 2021, Civics Unplugged will launch the SkywalkerZ collection, with the support of Mike Novogratz and Galaxy Gives. The set of 2,030 SkywalkerZ will be priced at .1ETH, and be tax deductible. 

Those who purchase an NFT will gain access to an exclusive community that has the power to vote and direct all funds raised from the SkywalkerZ project.
