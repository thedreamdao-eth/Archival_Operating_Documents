üí° Civics Unplugged is a 501c3 non-profit on a mission to revolutionize philanthropy. We are doing this by launching an NFT collection around 8am ET on October 11th that will raise massive amounts of funding for young leaders across the globe.

Ownership of an NFT is required to join a DAO, where members allocate all funds raised from this project. **This is our first step towards creating a decentralized community that funds world-changing leaders and ideas ‚Äî and we want your help.

We are looking for a select few institutional philanthropic bodies to seed this work, and co-build with us.** Check out [***this section*](Civics%20Unplugged's%20NFT%20and%20DAO%20Launch%20%E2%80%94%20Overview%20f%206849aac6c0714eabaa052512d65bf89d.md)** to learn exactly how to support us!

# The Overview

---

[Civics Unplugged](http://www.civicsunplugged.org) has currently soft-launched SkywalkerZ: CU's NFT collection whose proceeds will raise a **philanthropic fund dedicated to investing directly in Gen Z changemakers who are leveraging blockchain technology to build a brighter future across the globe.** 

Each NFT is priced at 0.1 ETH, and all proceeds will be held by the Dream DAO. 

The Dream DAO is a first-of-its-kind intergenerational community of builders, investors, and thinkers committed to investing in the future. Members of the DAO will be able to collectively decide on who they want to award Dream DAO Grants to. Dream DAO Grants will be initially valued at 1 ETH.

Ownership of a SkywalkerZ NFT is required to become a member of the Dream DAO. Donors can still opt to just support the fund itself, without participating in its allocation. Additionally, donors who are interested in investing in the DAO, but not holding a SkywalkerZ NFT, can do so by contacting the CU Team directly.

**From purely friends and family outreach, many notable figures have joined our mission. Among them, [Gabby Dizon](https://twitter.com/gabusch) from Axie, [Scott Moore](https://twitter.com/notscottmoore) from Gitcoin, [Baratunde Thurston](https://twitter.com/baratunde),  representatives from the Gates Foundation's Web3 x Social Impact initiative, and other member's of CU's existing philanthropic network.** 

We plan to remain in our "friends and family" stage until the end of October, to test assumptions and give the community time to set strong foundations for the project. We hope to engage in a large public relations campaign about the DAO, its supporters, and our vision for philanthropy, at the beginning of November.

üßëüèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ **Some examples of what the SkywalkerZ look like.**

Each Skywalker is unique, and assembled from 100+ possible traits. The contracts are standard ERC-721 compatible with any Ethereum-based NFT exchange.

Supporters can purchase an NFT at [getskywalkerz.com](http://getskywalkerz.com). Almost every NFT is randomly assembled, but there are some pre-designed "legendary" 1:1 SkywalkerZ in the collection as well!

## The Dream DAO

<aside>
üìñ You can read the Dream DAO whitepaper [here](https://www.notion.so/Civics-Unplugged-s-Dream-DAO-A-Deeper-Dive-5142d24477064342b71267242f15749b?pvs=21).

</aside>

The philanthropic fund raised from NFT purchases will be managed by the Dream DAO, whose members collectively decide to whom they want to award "Dream DAO Grants."

The value of each Dream DAO Grant is pegged at 10x the SkywalkerZ mint price‚Äîso if the price at the time is 0.1 ETH, the grant amount will be 1 ETH.

In addition to receiving a grant in the form of ETH, each grantee will be awarded a SkywalkerZ NFT, which secures their membership in the Dream DAO.

![dream dao (2) (1).png](Civics%20Unplugged's%20NFT%20and%20DAO%20Launch%20%E2%80%94%20Overview%20f%20043d75a9a9b84b43ac55ba0fd7f24a91/dream_dao_(2)_(1).png)

The idea behind a Dream DAO Grant is that it will provide a talented Gen Z leader with the financial freedom to launch their leadership journeys and build their dreams. There are no strings attached to the grant, unlike grants from almost any other grant-making institution.

For every SkywalkerZ NFT purchased, one SkywalkerZ NFT is given to an active member of CU‚Äôs existing Gen Z community to maintain an intergenerational balance of decision-making power. **A SkywalkerZ NFT is someone‚Äôs entry pass into the Dream DAO community.**

Civics Unplugged's existing community of thousands of young leaders around the world and extensive partner network will help curate potential grantees, until a DAO committee can be established. Grant proposals will be in a simple written or video format. 

Only 4,060 SkywalkerZ NFTs will ever be created: 2,030 for "Champions" of Gen Z leadership purchased through CU's official NFT-minting website, and 2,030 reserved for Gen Z members of the DAO.

We have designed the DAO such that the Gen Z members of our community always have significant voting power in the DAO.

## How Can Institutional Philanthropies support the NFTs and DAO?

<aside>
üî• **If you're reading this document, it's because we want to invite you to be a founding member of this movement by seeding the DAO treasury, and participating in our long term strategy. 

Civics Unplugged is a 501c3 non-profit. The DAO is structured such that all funds are held transparently by Civics Unplugged, maintaining their tax deductible status.**

</aside>

We have plans to engage media outlets and influencers to publicly announce the Dream DAO at the beginning of November. We'd love to be able to announce our Co-Founding institutional philanthropic partner who was critical in seeding the DAO, and supporting the first steps into decentralized philanthropy. 

[Co-Founding Sponsorship Opportunities](Civics%20Unplugged's%20NFT%20and%20DAO%20Launch%20%E2%80%94%20Overview%20f%206849aac6c0714eabaa052512d65bf89d/Co-Founding%20Sponsorship%20Opportunities%2072fb91c5ada748d6927bb48780de625b.csv)

We'd love to co-create and experiment with you. We ask that along with a donation, a representative from your organization joins the DreamDAO and participates alongside members of the DAO, and members of CU's donor community.

## The Dream DAO Roadmap

---

<aside>
‚ÑπÔ∏è Below is a tentative roadmap for the evolution of the DAO. We are incrementally inviting friends and family of Civics Unplugged that hold SkywalkerZ NFTs to "beta test" a digital-first philanthropic community.

In each phase of the DAO, members will have influence over:
‚Üí The number of new members allowed in the next phase
‚Üí The price of membership (the price of a SkywalkerZ NFT)
‚Üí How many grants are given out and to whom
‚Üí What additional NFTs (aka not the SkywalkerZ collection) we might want to release to the public for fundraising purposes
‚Üí DAO partnerships 
‚Üí And more...

At the end of each phase, there will be an auction of a 1:1 NFT that commemorates everything that was accomplished by the Dream DAO and its members during that phase. The proceeds of the auction would go toward funding the next Phase of the DAO.

## Why We Are Launching The Dream DAO

---

<aside>
üí° Civics Unplugged is a 501(c)(3) social enterprise whose mission is to empower the leaders of Gen Z to build a brighter future for humanity. CU partners with and is backed by National Geographic, Craig Newmark, Andrew Yang, Mike Novogratz, Audrey Tang, and more.

We are revolutionizing the way humanity invests in changemakers and our collective future. If successful, we will have enabled thousands of extraordinarily talented young people to devote their full attention to building public goods that will level up all sectors of society.

</aside>

If the past few years have shown us anything, it's that the breakdown of societal systems in one place impedes the potential for humans to flourish everywhere. To reverse our downward spiral and radically increase the health and resilience of our collective future, we must invest in young leaders who are eager to collaborate to support the flourishing of their communities and the world around them.

These youth have the creativity, energy, and passion to build a brighter future. In today's age, they can leverage collective intelligence, access resources, and make waves using just a mobile phone.

**However, they have two major roadblocks: funding üí∞ and connections ü§ù.**

To address this gap, Civics Unplugged raised its own capital to invest directly in young leaders and their projects. **Over the past year, we've moved over $100,000 directly to Gen Z and impacted hundreds of thousands of people.**

But this doesn't address the issue of connections. While the young leaders in the Civics Unplugged community are connected to each other, they don't get much exposure to Civics Unplugged's supporters‚Äîmany of whom are leaders in their respective sectors. Imagine all the good that can come from the world's most talented and capable young builders teaming up with the world's most experienced leaders and thinkers.

**The Dream DAO will...**

1. Remove financial barriers that stand in the way of young people building a brighter future for humanity
2. Encourage co-building between people of different generations trying to make a positive impact
3. Help close diversity and equity gaps in philanthropy, change-making, and web3 (by giving kids voting power and a financial stake in a growing social movement)

If CU's Dream DAO is successful, it can serve as a blueprint for any community of purpose to align funders and operators to effectively co-build the future together.
