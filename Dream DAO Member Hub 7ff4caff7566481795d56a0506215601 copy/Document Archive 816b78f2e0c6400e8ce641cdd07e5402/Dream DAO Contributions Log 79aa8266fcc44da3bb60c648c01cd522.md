ℹ️ At Dream DAO, we are committed to building and using a [Merit System](https://www.notion.so/The-Dream-DAO-Merit-System-d0625913c50d442b83c182ded4c94e24?pvs=21) that rewards contributors with recognition + voting power.

Foundational to building this system is tracking contributions, big and small, that *could* be officially recognized once the first version of the Merit System is released.

***Please add a comment at the top if a contribution is missing. Or DM Gary.***

**Please Note:** the “Size” of the contribution is rough and can be modified retroactively. It’s more important that we’re getting the contributions down on this table than worrying too much about precision.

**Unclaimed bounties are found at the bottom of this page.**
