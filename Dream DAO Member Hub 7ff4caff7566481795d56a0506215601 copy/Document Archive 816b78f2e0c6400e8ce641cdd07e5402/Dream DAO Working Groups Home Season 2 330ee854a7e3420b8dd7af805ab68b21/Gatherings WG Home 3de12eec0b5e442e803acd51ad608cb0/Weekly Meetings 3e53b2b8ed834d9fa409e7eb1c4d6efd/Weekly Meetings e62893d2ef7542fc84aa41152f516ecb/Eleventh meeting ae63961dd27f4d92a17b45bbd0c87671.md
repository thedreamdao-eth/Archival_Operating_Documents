ðŸ“™ **Lecture**

</aside>

Joshua began by explaining that the item to be discussed at this meeting was to review the new feedback points made by Madison on the badges made by the gathering group over the last two weeks.

- He explained that last week one of the weekly tasks was to review the means of transportation from the airport to the hotel and back. Joshua told us that he had already contacted them but had no response, so he sent them a message by whatsapp and email so they are responding. He expects to hear back from them over the weekend. So that task is already being covered.

And then he read the following document (focusing on the comments it contains): [Merit Badges ](../../Documentation%20f50072dede0842d38cc276f0fde76a0e/Documentation%20db789829c0044519b7d9641e4dfe27be/Merit%20Badges%2008117b0d610b45e5a17b87eb907f353a.md)

ðŸ—£ **Discussion & Questions**

</aside>

**Joshua:** As a first part Madison added that it would be good to only leave the "Application Master" and delete the two badges "Application Creator" and "Application Reviewer" because these two are already included. What do you think?

Ibtehaj: Yes, I agree. I think maybe at the moment there are not many builders applying to events, for Devcon we only got 12 applications, so for the moment I think it could be simplified in the process, so yes, I like the idea.

**Joshua:** I just saw that you just joined Julieta, do you have any comments on this?

**Julieta:** None, it all makes sense, I agree.

**Joshua:** Good, then we can eliminate them.

**Joshua:** Excellent, now I see that Madison commented something on our "Master Gatherings WG member" badge where she said to specify the number of sessions that must be attended in order to get this badge, she suggested 10 meetings. So the situation here is that we are in the middle of the season, so far counting with this one we have eleven meetings and if we multiply it by the rest of this season it would be more or less 20 to 22 meetings. But, we have to consider that maybe the week of Devcon we will not be able to have our weekly meeting and that the later meetings will not be necessary to have some because most of the work can be done asynchronously so the number of meetings could be variable, what do you think? The other option is to have a minimum number that at least should be attended?

**Julieta:** Yes, I think the second option of having a minimum number of meetings attended would be better. Because these can be variable.

**Joshua:** Well, do you think the number of having attended at least seven sessions is okay?

**Julieta:** Yes, I think it could be at least seven to nine.

**Joshua:** Well, I think a good number would make it eight.

**Joshua:** Okay, now I think we have a total of three badges because we eliminated the two that we already commented on so, we're down to two more badges. So feel free to add your ideas here over the weekend or during the week.

**Tarun:** Sorry, how many sessions in total are there?

**Joshua:** If we continue with the sessions on a regular basis at the end of this season we would have 20 meetings in total, because maybe after devcon we will focus on the Learning Artifacts so it could be less, so the number of minimum sessions required could also vary.
