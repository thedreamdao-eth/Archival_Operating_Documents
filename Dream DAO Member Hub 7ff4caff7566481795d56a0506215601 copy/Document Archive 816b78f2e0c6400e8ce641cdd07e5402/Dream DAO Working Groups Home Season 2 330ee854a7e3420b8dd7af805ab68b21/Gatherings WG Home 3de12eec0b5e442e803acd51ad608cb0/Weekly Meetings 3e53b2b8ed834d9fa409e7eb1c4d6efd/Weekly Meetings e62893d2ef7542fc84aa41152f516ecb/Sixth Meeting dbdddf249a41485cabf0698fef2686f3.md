The topics we are going to talk about today, is to:

- Determinate the next steps we are going to take to continue with the selection process for Devcon Bogota and have the people that are join Dream DAO in this trip.

In total we have 12 applications submitted for Devcon Bogota, so that's very good. And we also hope to have more applications for the next season with more web3 events and conferences but I think this number of applicants are perfect!

ðŸ—£ **Discussion & Questions**

</aside>

**Joshua:** In our last session two weeks ago we were discussing that if we had more than ten applications we would have a voting system.

Madison, I don't know if we would do it in Snapshot or in a paper form? And for that we will have to make public the answers of the people who applied but only the "About You" section, so we can see why the builders are interested in attending this event, why they are motivated, what contributions they have made so far, etc. So just to know if the selection procedure is ok? Or does anyone have any other ideas?

**Madison:** I would recommend that we use the process we use in the Co-stewards election, because if we use the voting process we use for the working group leaders it may not be as good because the votes are not anonymous. So I think it would be better to make a paperform and do the calculaited range of votes manually.

In terms of like figuring out who was actually the top two based on range voting.But basically we would give bounties to like five people to double check the results andyeah, I think that that process works well.While we don't have a solid system in place, it kind of gets the job done and we could get it out on what I could do is on Monday I could send out the applications and then on Friday we could send out the paper form to act as like the vote.

**Joshua:** Yeah, that would be awesome. So you mean that the publication would like to be public on Monday right? And the open boats on Friday if I understood correctly?

**Madison:** Yup, that's right.

**Joshua:** Okay, awesome. So yeah, I was thinking the same as making it like for the person not public to all people. So I was thinking about Monday as well.

I guess here is like to create discovery. tabs about each builder and then I don't like to have a lot of conversations. People ask me why do you want to go? Because I think that is answered in the answer, they answer in the form. So that would be like I think disadvantage from orders because a lot of builders are not very active nowadays. So maybe the active can answer the questions that the other people can do. So I just position their answers and can be accessible to everyone, to everybody member here would be awesome. We could give all people five days to read that and to think about which ones will be the best people to vote for them would be awesome. And then on Friday I think we can send the paper from we can give people five days if that's good and then we can make a bounty for two people just to cosign the results. Does that make sense?

**Chat Team:** Okay, yeah, sounds good.

**Joshua:** So I don't know anyone who wants to help me just to collect all the answers and paste it into one document and then I will send this document to you. Might even like to be easier for you or well I don't know do you like to create the thread for the people or do I create it or anyone who wants to take a lead on that.

Madison: So what you all can do is on Monday is I'm trying to think because Adarsh normally sends out proposals on Monday and he has some to send out on Monday so maybe before then one of you could put together something that Adarsh can send out on Monday It's normally like late in the day, like Indian time and morning afternoon eastern time.

So just like basically a document that has explaining what we're doing in terms of voting and that here's a link to the answers that you can look at.

And then you can help out a darsh by creating the threads too, if you would like. But that would be great to help him out.

**Joshua:** Yeah. Okay. So the first one was Rahid. So I think that because it's like the person who would like to help.

**Rohit:** I can help!

**Julieta:** I can do that!

**Ibtehaj:** Me too!

**Fernando:** Also me!

**Joshua:** Oh I think all here wants to help so, maybe one like to create the thing, the system like that we are doing and then another one that just copy and paste the answers in one document to be easy for all people to read them and that others can send that. So maybe we can have two people helping with this task.

So the first ones I think was Rohit and Julieta, maybe.

**Chat Team:** Yeah. Awesome.

**Joshua:** So I think this is going to be due Sunday. If we can have that until Sunday, it would be awesome.

**Rohit: We could anonymously post the names of the applicants and vote anonymously, and the voting could work that way, maybe?**

**Madison:** That's a pretty good question. I don't know. I don't think that hiding the names. I feel like it's kind of like important context just for them to know who it is. Yeah, I don't think there should be too much of a problem if people know who you are. That's like how we do it for elections anyway. So I kind of see this as an election be to much, if that makes sense?

**Joshua:** Yeah! Okay, so just like to make a

**Julieta:** Ithink the same!

**Joshua:** Just to recap but we already talked here. We are going to like to launch open to the voting members and the answers that filled out the form and then on Friday we would like to make the elections if we can collect that and then before that. Rohit and Julieta will help with task of drafting just like an overview of the process to make so everyone can know what we are doing and how we are selecting.

The builders like to make just things good and to collect just all the answers from people, the names and their answers in the documents. People can access to that easily. And where I like to have the elections from Friday to five days, friday, Saturday, Sunday until Tuesday if I make the count correctly. And then we will have it in builders.

So if anyone here wants to add something else or wants to propose anything else, this is like the perfect time.

**Julieta: Only to ask Rohit and me are we going to do like the PDF document with the answers of the people that applied and like the notion paper to send into the proposal, right?**

**Joshua:** Yeah, kind of that you are just like the title of overview of the application to the composite system

So then you're going to try and overview of what we're doing. So in that they will say, okay, we are going to like to make a public application so people can vote and select the ten builders that I would like to go there. So first you need to read all the applicant answers correctly.

And then when it's Friday, you can vote, like, something like that. And then you're going to list each answers of the people.

And then that document, you need to send it to me and then I will send it to Rohit. AndI would like to send that document to others so others can send it on Monday to all the boarding members here and to have like, a lot of people can read that document. I hope that makes sense.

**Julieta:** Yeah, that's great. Thank you.

**Joshua:** Awesome.
