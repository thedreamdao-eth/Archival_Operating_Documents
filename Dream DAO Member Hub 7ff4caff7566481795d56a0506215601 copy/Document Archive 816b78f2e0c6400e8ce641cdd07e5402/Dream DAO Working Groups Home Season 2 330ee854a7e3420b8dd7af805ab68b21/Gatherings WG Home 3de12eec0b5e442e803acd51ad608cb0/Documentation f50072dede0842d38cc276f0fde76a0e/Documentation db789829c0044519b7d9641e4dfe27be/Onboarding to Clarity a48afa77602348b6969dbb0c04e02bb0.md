## **Short Guide üöÄ**

**1) To start use the following link to hace access to clarity:** [https://app.clarity.so/invite-link/adxCO59u06](https://app.clarity.so/invite-link/adxCO59u06) then join the Dream DAO base.

**2)** Go through the ‚Äú**Fill out your profile‚Äù** section on this link: [https://app.clarity.so/wiki/pages/298f333d-a0d9-41f9-9375-6468c1c992f0](https://app.clarity.so/wiki/pages/298f333d-a0d9-41f9-9375-6468c1c992f0) and follow the instructions mentioned.

- Link your [MetaMask Wallet](https://metamask.io/) (once you click link, the MetaMask extension will automatically open up and allow you to link your wallet with Clarity)
- Add an email address - optional (this will allow you to receive notifications)
- Set a custom username for your wallet - optional (if you don't have an ENS domain it would be awesome to custom a username so people can recognize you easily)
- Set a password - optional (you do not need to set up a password, however, if you add a password then you can use your username and password to login instead of your email or wallet)

**3)** You are done setting up your Clarity account! Follow the next steps to auto-assign your roles:

- Go to your left sidebar and click in settings
- Then go to members and look for your name
- Click on "select roles" and assign the Gatherings WG role.

**4)** Toggle on the Gatherings WG 

**5)** That's all (for now)!
