Dream DAO will be flying out 10 Builders to Bogotá, Colombia for Devcon Bogotá, October 9th-14th. 

- **Application Form:** [https://8dgledvy.paperform.co](https://8dgledvy.paperform.co/)

**Information:** 

**We will be selecting up to 10 Builders to join us for this trip.**

- We will be prioritizing NON-US citizens (who are legally allowed to travel to Bogotá, Colombia).
- We will be allowing Builders who are 15, 16, or 17 years old if their parents sign this form.

**Other info about the trip:**

- You will be staying in an Airbnb near the convention center in the Soledad neighborhood, which is recommended by the Devcon team for safety and convenience [here](https://devcon.org/en/bogota/).
    - We encourage you to read the full safety briefing from Devcon [here](https://devcon.org/en/bogota/).
- Your flight and hotel cost will be covered by Dream DAO (Dream DAO will book your flight for you).
- CU / Dream DAO will cover one group dinner - food expenses otherwise will not be covered.
- You will check out of the hotel in the AM of October 14th (the default is for you to have a flight out that evening).
- If you would like to stay longer—by getting to Bogotá earlier and/or leaving later—you need to find and pay for your own lodging (Dream DAO will still cover a departure and return flight though).
- Saf and Carl will be your main points of contact during this trip (they will be organized a detailed agenda). They have both passed a formal background check by Dream DAO.
