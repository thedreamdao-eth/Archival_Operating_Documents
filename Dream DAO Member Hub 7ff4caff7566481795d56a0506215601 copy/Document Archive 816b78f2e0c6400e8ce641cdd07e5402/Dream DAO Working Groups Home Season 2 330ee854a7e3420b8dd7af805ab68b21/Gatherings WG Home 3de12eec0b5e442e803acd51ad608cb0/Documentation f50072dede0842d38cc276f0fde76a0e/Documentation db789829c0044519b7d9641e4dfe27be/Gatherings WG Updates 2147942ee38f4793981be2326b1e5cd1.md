ðŸš€ General Updates

</aside>

- We've had 5 weekly meetings so far in Season 2.
- We have carefully reviewed more than 6 web3 conferences/events that will take place between September - November.
- We have defined the research steps to be followed for future web3 events in other seasons.

ðŸ’« Web3 Events/Conferences Updates

</aside>

- After a long research and discussion the WG proposes only to send **up to 10 builders to Devcon BogotÃ¡**, which will take place from August 11th to 14th as we consider that it is the only event that meets the minimum requirements proposed in our Key Results and in function to Dream DAO's mission during Season 2.
- Currently (thanks to Madison and those who helped) we already confirmed have 10 tickets for Devcon BogotÃ¡.
- We have identified the two chaperones that will be joining the builders on this trip.
- We have already drafted the application process for the builders which you can view using this link [https://bb1hgyct.paperform.co/](https://bb1hgyct.paperform.co/) (improvements will be made during the week).
- We are in the process of creating an information package for builders and parents/guardians to give their consent to apply for the adventure.

The timeline to be followed will be as follows (open for feedback):

- From **August 12th to August 17th** corrections will be made to the application form as well as the creation of the information package for later review at our weekly meeting which will be held on August 18th.
- From **August 19th to 23rd** the application for Devcon Bogota will be open to all Builders.
- In case there are more than 10 applications (let's hope so!) there will be an election process for the DAO members to choose and vote for the builders from **August 24rd to August 29th**.
- **Date to be determined** - the 10 builders will be announced so we can continue with the documentation/process/guide/etc and start the Key Result 3.

ðŸš¨ Other Updates - they are important too!

</aside>

- Joshua and Saf will have to identify a new schedule for the weekly meetings because it will be impossible for Joshua to attend them due to his evening schedule at college.
- We will start creating a document that guides/help builders to do a Learning Artifact about their experience at Devcon BogotÃ¡ and other trips.
