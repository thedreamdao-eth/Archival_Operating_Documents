# Gatherings WG Objectives

<aside>
üí° On a high level, working groups operate based on the **key results** that they create. Key results can be thought of as the deliverables the working group will create for a season. For example, create a merit system, onboard 15 new Builders, etc. They should be tangible and measurable. Once the key results are created, working groups spend the season working towards those key results.

Considering the overview above, many of our key results should be framed around the question, **‚ÄúHow can we help to continuously decentralize and sustain the DAO, such that it can thrive for years to come?‚Äù**

## Overview

Starting in Season 2, we want to start bringing lots of builders to conferences and start hosting in-person events and online conferences (that involve more than just voting members). Right now, a lot of this work is being done by Gary but as we begin this and scale having a working group would be incredibly valuable. 

## Objective

<aside>
üí° To create seamless travel, speakership and learning experiences at IRL regen web3 events around the world

</aside>

## Activities

- Maintain a calendar of relevant web3 events
- Support members to apply / participate in web3 conferences
- Design and promote Dream DAO events and meet-ups
- Handle all aspects of IRL event planning and logistics
- Administer POAPs for Dream DAO events
- Work closely with Partnerships WG to get sponsors & cohosts
- Create swag for members to rock at events

## Key Results for Season 2

- **1. Identify Events**
    1. Use [https://ethereum.org/en/community/events/](https://ethereum.org/en/community/events/)
    2. Find all events between September-November
    3. Lightly do a filter of Dream DAO friendly ones
    4. Create a database for all those events in that time frame, which-
        1. Align to the Dream DAO mission
        2. Are accessible to builders and champions
        3. Offer an opportunity to learn + connect for Dream DAO to grow (something which can be further ideated with the Partnerships WG)
        4. Require minimal but necessary documentation requirements (in terms of visa and such)
    5. We assign members of our working group to work around finding detail in the events and how they fit well in the four sub points mentioned in the last point **(this can be a bounty, I need to talk to Madison for this)**
    6. Finalize the **two chosen events** and present it to the DAO Council
- **2. Create an application process that is easy to complete but allows Builders to make informed decisions about the events they choose to attend.**
    
    **Awareness:**
    
    1. Ensure people have a decent understanding about what events are in the Dream DAO‚Äôs list to be at - what the events are about + when and where they are happening.
    2. Spreading awareness within the DAO for the five chosen events (as per 1.6)
    
    Successful completion of this Key Result would be getting **at least 10 applicants** to each of the two events. 
    
- **3. Help with documentation**
    1. Confirm that Builder applicants are aware of the documentation/process that is involved in order to travel to a conference. 
    2. Ensure any chaperones that are attending have completed a background check. 
    3. Verify that all attending Builders have completed the required documentation in advance of the trip. 
    
    Key Result: no one who is accepted to attend an event is unable to make it due to having incomplete documentation.
    
- **4. Send the DreamerZ off**
    1. After fulfilling key results 1-3 we can proudly say that DreamerZ can attend the event
    2. Check all the things that are happening there (attendees are comfortable and are attending the conferences, enjoying, chilling, making new connections, etc)
    
    Key Result: no one who is at the event is missing something and not take full advantage of the opportunity!
    
- **5. Share the DreamerZ‚Äôs experiences and discuss what‚Äôs ahead**
    1. Identify different avenues for sharing our learning, and enjoying experiences
    2. Take time to reflect on our travel on an individual and a tribal basis.
    3. Support Builders with their Learning Artifacts and have deadlines to share what builders did + enjoyed ASAP
    
    Key Result: Have the Learning Artifacts of the builders who attended the event ready no later than 3 weeks after the event concluded.
