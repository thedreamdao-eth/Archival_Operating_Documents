ðŸ’¡ While the focus of this event is to deliberate on government functions, the future of the industry and how this will transform businesses. This one is a bit more on the point of social transformation related to government we are looking for on Dream DAO.

- Build and foster connections

*** Questions and Comments:**

We could ask if there are open volunteer slots where we can collaborate for the event, if the team agrees.  And also if we want to purchase tickets to this event the closing date to buy them at a lower price, is close to close.
