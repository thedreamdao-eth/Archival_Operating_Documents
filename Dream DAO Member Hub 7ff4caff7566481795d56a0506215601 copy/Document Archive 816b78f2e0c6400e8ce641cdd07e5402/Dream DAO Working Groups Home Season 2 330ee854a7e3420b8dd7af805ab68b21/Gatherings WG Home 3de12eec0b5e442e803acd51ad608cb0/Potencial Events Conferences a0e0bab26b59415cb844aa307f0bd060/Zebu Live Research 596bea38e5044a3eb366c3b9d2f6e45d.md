ðŸ’¡ Although Zebu-Live, is not specialized on Web3 x Social impact, This event is especially suitable for Dream DAO builders as the conference touches on various areas in Web3 space such as DeFi, NFTs, Gaming, DAOs, etc. Builder will experience lots of learning throughout the event. (Not very sure yet) but the beauty of this conference is that itâ€™s not focused on coding-related, haha, which is perfect for Dream DAO builders
