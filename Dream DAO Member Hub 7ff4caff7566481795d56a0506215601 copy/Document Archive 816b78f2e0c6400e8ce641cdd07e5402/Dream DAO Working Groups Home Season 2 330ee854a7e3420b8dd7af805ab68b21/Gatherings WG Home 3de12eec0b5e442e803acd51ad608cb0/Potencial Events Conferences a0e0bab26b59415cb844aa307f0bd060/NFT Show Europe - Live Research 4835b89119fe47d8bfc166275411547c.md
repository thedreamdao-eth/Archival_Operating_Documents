<aside>
💡 Although NFT Show Europe is an event especially focused on the artistic area of web3, maybe it is not the social impact focus that we foucs at DreamDAO. Being a specialized area event, I would think that the event could be embroidered from a more advanced point of knowledge to web3, rather than introducing builders to this new ecosystem.

### **Dream DAO as a Hole**

- The topics and speakers that are going to play are quite interesting and can be quite appealing to some specific builders who are interested in the topic.
