The story of the Dream DAO starts with [Civics Unplugged](http://www.civicsunplugged.org), a 501(c)(3) social enterprise that empowers the leaders of Gen Z with the training, funding, and network they need to build a brighter future for humanity.

Twice a year, we run a Fellowship program that trains 500 exceptional high school-aged leaders around the world to be civic innovators. Since November 1st, 2020, we have invested over $100,000 in Fellowship graduates.

These young leaders have [created](https://www.civicsunplugged.org/projects) and [contributed to](https://www.civicsunplugged.org/strategies) projects that have already positively impacted hundreds of thousands of people. Their missions range from sex education in Brazil, democracy reform in Florida, climate tech education in NYC, voter access around the US, diversity and inclusion training around the globe, and more.

While we have had success supporting young people who are working to better their communities and the world in valuable ways, we recognize that young people won't be able to build paradigm-shifting projects necessary to effectively address today's global crises without proper training to innovate.

In an increasingly digital world, technology is the cornerstone of innovation. So how can we empower Gen Z to leverage its power for good?

As we have seen time and time again, new technology can unlock radically better possibilities for what the world can look like.

While blockchain and cryptocurrency have received a massive influx of cultural attention over the past year thanks to [DeFi](https://ethereum.org/en/defi/), [meme coins](https://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/why-are-meme-tokens-so-popular-in-2021/#:~:text=Meme%20coins%20are%20essentially%20cryptocurrencies,it%20is%20a%20successful%20crypto.), and [profile picture NFTs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bragging-rights-twitter-previews-verification-badge-for-nft-profile-pics), they are revolutionary, world-changing technologies that present hope for a future that is more resilient, collaborative, and equitable.

Early web3 social impact projects and the first DAOs to keep thousands of members engaged hint at the enormous potential of web3 to change the world.

**But how can we ensure the power of web3 is harnessed to change the world for the better?**

It's unclear what the legacy of blockchain, cryptocurrency, DAOs, and the extraordinary wealth they have generated will be by 2030.

Will the web3 space be known for having supercharged humanity's ability to address our greatest challenges?

Or will it be known for having largely neglected real-world problems and drastically steepened socioeconomic divides during this [make-or-break decade](https://www.rethinkx.com/humanity)?

In order for web3 space to realize its potential to build a better world, a lot more must be done to cultivate the web3 x social impact ecosystemâ€”so that young civic innovators who seek to leverage web3 get the support and community they need to build a brighter future for humanity.

## That's where the Dream DAO comes in.

**The Dream DAO is a new, intergenerational, global, and interdisciplinary community that invests in the future of the web3 x social impact ecosystem, by providing diverse Gen Zers around the globe with the training, funding, and community they need to leverage the power of web3 to secure a brighter future for humanity.**
