Notes: This grant is 60k, but it has required KPIs that will cost us money. When using this money- we shouldn’t be just thinking about how to complete those KPIs at cost- we should try to do them below cost so we can make a “profit” and use the money to fund our operations. Operations are our biggest cost by far and grants for operations are very hard to secure. 

If we hit the following KPIs by August 2021, we will get ANOTHER 60k from Celo: 

1) Have created: 
→1 accessible onboarding document and 1 accessible onboarding video created which serves to persuade
→3 inspiring Celo ecosystem builders/leaders interviews
→5 Learning Together sessions with Celo

2) 20 trips funded and taken by Dream DAO Builders, and each trip produced a “knowledge artifact”

3) 3 “Regen Ragers” hosted- Madison is going to try to work with Celo to change this to Builders hosting meetups in their hometowns
