Question/Topic,What it is
"What is CU? ","Civics Unplugged is a 501c3 social enterprise whose mission is to empower the leaders of Generation Z to build a brighter future for humanity.

We are re-imagining civic education and sparking a global civic renewal by building a community of young leaders who are committed to realizing their potential, and supporting the flourishing of their communities and the world around them.

Civics Unplugged is led by graduates of the CU Fellowship, an intensive three-month leadership program that trains thousands of high schoolers each year in the fundamentals of personal development, systems thinking, and civic literacy."
The Civics Unplugged Community,"Our community is made up of 1,500+ Gen Zers, representing all 50 U.S. States, as well as 47 countries around the globe. Spanning North and South America, Africa, Asia, and Europe, 74% of our community identifies as women, 70% identify as BIPOC, and 22% are part of an active U.S. Military family.

"Why is CU Launching an NFT? ","A SkywalkerZ NFT is someone’s entry pass into the Dream DAO community. Through a decentralized philanthropic model, we are revolutionizing the way humanity invests in changemakers, initiatives, and its collective future.

If successful, we will have enabled thousands of extraordinarily talented young people to devote their full attention to building public goods that will level up all sectors of society. "
"What do you mean by ""youth-led""?","The secret sauce of Civics Unplugged's youth empowerment system is our commitment to operationalizing our motto ""The Kids Will Lead"" in everything we do. Kids govern our community, co-run our Fellowship, come up with the big ideas we invest significant resources in, and co-lead every aspect of CU's evolution."
"What does ""build a brighter future for humanity"" mean?","Climate change, racial injustice, and other issues that plague our world can only be solved if we train radically empathetic, community minded and systems oriented leaders who represent an answer to the global leadership crisis. We're building the future by creating leaders who are equipped to build it, and then empowering them to do so. "
