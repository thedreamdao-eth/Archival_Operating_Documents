# What do you mean by "youth-led"?

What it is: The secret sauce of Civics Unplugged's youth empowerment system is our commitment to operationalizing our motto "The Kids Will Lead" in everything we do. Kids govern our community, co-run our Fellowship, come up with the big ideas we invest significant resources in, and co-lead every aspect of CU's evolution.
