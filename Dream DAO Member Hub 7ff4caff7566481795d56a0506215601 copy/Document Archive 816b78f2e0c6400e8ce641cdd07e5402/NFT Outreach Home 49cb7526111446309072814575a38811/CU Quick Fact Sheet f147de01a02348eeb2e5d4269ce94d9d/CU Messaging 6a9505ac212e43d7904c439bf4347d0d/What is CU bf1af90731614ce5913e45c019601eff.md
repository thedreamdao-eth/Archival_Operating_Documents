# What is CU?

What it is: Civics Unplugged is a 501c3 social enterprise whose mission is to empower the leaders of Generation Z to build a brighter future for humanity.

We are re-imagining civic education and sparking a global civic renewal by building a community of young leaders who are committed to realizing their potential, and supporting the flourishing of their communities and the world around them.

Civics Unplugged is led by graduates of the CU Fellowship, an intensive three-month leadership program that trains thousands of high schoolers each year in the fundamentals of personal development, systems thinking, and civic literacy.
