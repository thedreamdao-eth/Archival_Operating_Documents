DISCLAIMER SCREEN

1. As we explain in the [Dream DAO whitepaper](https://www.notion.so/The-Dream-DAO-Community-4d4475e8905f4d2c95c1504e9b8b17d8?pvs=21), there are two broad pathways to membership in the Dream DAO community. If you are not a member of Generation Z, your pathway into the community is to become a "Dream DAO Champion," a role that will be held by those committing funds, connections, opportunities, guidance, and other resources to supercharge the growth and impact of the Gen Z "Dream DAO Builders" in our community.
2. Filling out this interest form is a very important part of the process by which the Civics Unplugged team will decide who will be a Founding Dream DAO Champion.
3. There is no need to write more than three to five sentences per field. We just want to get a sense of who you are.
4. Please include your social media handles when possible (and personal website where relevant), it helps us get a sense of who you are.
5. It's important to join the [Dream DAO Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/eeRPzQD9) immediately after submitting the interest form and open your DMs beyond ‘friends only'. We send notifications via email and Discord DM if we need additional information or if you've been approved. 
6. The review process takes approximately 5 to 7 days, in some cases it may take longer. Please allow at least one week for us to review your submission.

Need to ask:

- Discord Username (ex: username#1234): *

Click your username in the bottom left corner of Discord to copy it. It is highly recommended you paste this in and do not type it yourself.
