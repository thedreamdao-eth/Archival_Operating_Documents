***Framework for DAO Tooling - Key Components and Features to Consider***

- üèõ **Governance** - capabilities to establish roles for key members, keep a history of past decisions, formalize documentation all in one platform
- ‚úÖ **Voting** - capability to conduct votes on governance and other proposals, either using wallet verification or permissions based on governance roles
- üìÉ **Documentation** - tooling that allows for permissioned access for members to view things such as meeting minutes, recaps of discussions, policies and procedures, and other pieces that are published within the DAO for members
- üìè **Assignment and Workflow** - capability to post missions or tasks to the community and the ability for DAO members to be assigned or volunteer to complete.  A positive feature is being able to reward the assignee upon completion of the task or mission.  Will contribute to the ability to understand contribution / make it less qualitative or manually tracked
- üîë **Access and Validation** - tooling that integrates with membership and access into various DAO roles, generated off of on-chain activity and ownership of DAO issued NFTs / tokens etc.  Most helpful to be able to have a control to keep track, even better if automated to take action once wallet activity occurs. Also gating access to member-only content / benefits.
- üíµ **Treasury** - tooling to provide transparency to the Treasury and monitor activity.  This allows for metrics around fundraising such as NFT sales, outside contributions, and other aspects.  Positives for any features that help optimize and hedge treasury positions to best grow but protect DAO assets\
- **Content** - Publishing content; Drafting + curating content; Both public and DAO-only consumption; Curating/saving bookmarkable content from the outside
- **CRM** - Mapping out who we know; Donor prioritization + assignment

As a group, we should be doing research on tools that may do one or many of the features above.  On the surface, having all in one platform may seem ideal, but its best to strike a balance between convenience and utility/efficacy of tools (i.e. if an all-in-one solution has a voting tool, but it doesn‚Äôt fit with how we have structured voting, best to get a standalone solution that fits our goals)

***When you research different tools, here is a helpful list of questions you should be answering so we can standardize our results and be able to assess these as a group:***

1. What is this tool and what is its marketed purpose?
2. What capability that Dream DAO needs (listed above) is this tool used for (if more than one please list)?
3. Does it align well with what we are trying to achieve at the DreamDAO?  If so, in what key ways? (give examples if possible)
4. Is this solution going to replace existing capability (such as interacting on slack instead of discord)?  If so why consider it?  Or will it be adding something net new to our toolbox that we do not already have?
5. What are the strengths of this tool (and does it align with what we need)?
6. What are the weaknesses (if any apparent)?
7. Any other commentary?
