As we approach Season 2 of the Dream DAO, launch our Explorers Program, and plan for the future of the DAO, we plan to do a second drop of SkywalkerZ to capitalize on excitement around our work and support the future of the DAO. 

*This document explains the design and strategy for the second drop. Please note that this approach is a first draft and input is very welcome! This first draft was created by the attendees of the initial DAO-wide jam session: Gary, Madhav, and Madison.*

## Overview

---

### Objective

The money raised from SkywalkerZ Batch #2 will fund DAO operations. Externally, we will brand it as supporting our mission of supporting Gen Z in using web3 for good. We have proven out the concept and built out our DAO, and we need more resources to further that mission. 

We could also list different things the money might be used for: 

- Paying contributors
- Sending Builders to conferences
- Funding Builders’ projects

### Number of SkywalkerZ

For the initial batch of SkywalkerZ, we did not have a clear plan or marketing strategy. As a result, the main buyers were close friends of CU and its founders. For the second batch, we need to create a clear strategy that sets us up for success. 

Many NFT projects set a pre-determined number of NFTs to be sold. The utility of setting a pre-determined number is that scarcity drives FOMO and success. However, we can utilize a different form of scarcity: **time ⏳**. The second batch of SkywalkerZ will only be available to mint for one week, with a cap of 500 SkywalkerZ being sold (which would raise ~$150,000).

This 1-week minting timeframe without a 500 cap on minting amount makes sense because the marketing will be one big push (people forced to do it all at the same time because the deadline is so short), for an entire week, people’s feed and inboxes will be filled with SkywalkerZ.

### Price

The price of the second batch will be the same as the first: 0.1 ETH. This number is not too expensive but shows commitment to the cause. Additionally, when hundreds of SkywalkerZ are purchased 0.1 ETH adds up quickly and provides substantial funding. 

### Membership

With the launch of this second batch, we will open up 20 Champion spots and 20 Builder spots. This number of memberships makes sense because: 

- At the time of the launch, many of our most engaged Builders will be busy with the Explorers program
- By the time of the launch we will have our foundational systems created such as governance and community building

## Marketing

---

The second batch of SkywalkerZ will have a much better, widespread, and focused marketing strategy. 

### Promo Kit

We will create a promo kit that has templates for tweets, instagram posts, emails, and more. There will also be flyers for people to promote with. 

### Partners

We will have significantly more partners for this second batch, including...

- The Coinbase NFT platform (they will also promote on their social media)
- Organizations hosting Builders for internships
- Organizations we have formed friendship and partnerships with throughout Season 1 (leaders from Gitcoin, Celo, Harmony, NEAR, etc)

### Strategies

- For everyone who mints a SkywalkerZ, we will encourage them to post their SkywalkerZ and say why they minted, and encourage 3 other people to mint by tagging them on Twitter. Whoever participates in this will receive a POAP.
- We will clearly outline the benefits of holding a SkywalkerZ, even if you are not a member:
    - Learning Together access
    - Access to a bunch of community Discord channels
    - Ability to join our Intros club (this would be new)
    - Opportunity to apply to become a Champion
