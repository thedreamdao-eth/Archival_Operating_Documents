## Why?

To create a web3 onboarding process that **directly integrates social impact applications into its curriculum.** 

- Current web3 onboarding resources are aimed towards the financial aspect
- Successful proof-of-concepts that we can model ourselves after are:
    - [Kernel](https://kernel.community/en/learn/) takes a philosophical/moral lens
    - Gitcoin takes a collaboration/public-goods lens
- We can take a social impact-based lens?
    - What makes us unique from Future Foundation?

## How?

- Maybe first outline the problems and show that how blockchain could solve them . its probably the best way to make one interested into the opportunities web3 has to offer.
    - Why do people cook books and lead to looses of the normal people .
    - How can we solve the trust issue with the banks .
    - The possibilities of an immutable ledger that cant be hacked or changed?
- Integrate successful social impact case studies that Ale is working on!
