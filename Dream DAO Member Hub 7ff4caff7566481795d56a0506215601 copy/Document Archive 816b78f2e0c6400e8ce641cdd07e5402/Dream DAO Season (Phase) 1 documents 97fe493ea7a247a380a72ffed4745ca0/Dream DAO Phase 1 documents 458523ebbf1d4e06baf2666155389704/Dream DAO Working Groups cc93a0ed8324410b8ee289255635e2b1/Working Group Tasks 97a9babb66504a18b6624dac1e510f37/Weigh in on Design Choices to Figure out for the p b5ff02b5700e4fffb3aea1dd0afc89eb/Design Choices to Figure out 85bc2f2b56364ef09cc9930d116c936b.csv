Design choice/question,Tentative thoughts as a group,Asynchronous Thoughts/Ideas
Selection Process / criteria,"All Dream DAO builders?

Who is selecting? 

How does the merit system play into this?

Is there voting?

Are we factoring in DEI in this?",
How can we educate parents?,They may be confused about web3,
Relationship to rest of DAO learning,"Way more hands on learning (project building)

More independent learning: maybe each Explorer needs to do a DEEP dive on a question that the web3 world should have insight into.
→ a default question could be: what is one problem not being solved in social impact world; and how could web3 support it? (and questions like this)

→ Build weekends?

→ Small Juntos
",
How does the Leadership Blueprint / personal development fit in?,"Will help people figure out their You-Shaped hole in web3

Some inspiration: https://www.notion.so/9fdefed3197d4044972c64d4698210fc?pvs=21",
Nature of the internships,"→ in summer - 2-3 months?

→ explorer gets to “own” a tangible set of key results that they spend the summer driving to achieving
→ web3 x social impact related (need to flesh out criteria)
→ Does this have to do with the independent research question?",
Stipend size + distribution schedule,"→ How do the internship host sites help fund the Explorers program?

→ Who else is funding the Explorers program?

→ The stipend must be good enough to justify working nearly full time during summer

- - - 

Laws around crypto payment (and other payment) should be looked into",
What is the capstone/exit criteria? (Ethan),"→ How can we make sure that the explorers are learning? 

→ Should there be requirements surrounding builders to prove their learning?
",
How do other DAOs fit into this?,Maybe Explorers need to do 1 or more bounties in other DAOs,
How mentors fit in,"→ 1:1 mentorship
→ We’d probably open up mentorship applications to beyond our Champion community?

→ should the mentor be someone related to the internship host site?

→ is there multiple mentors?",
How many explorers?,,
Relationship + responsibilities of Explorers to rest of DAO / web3,"→ Share their research in consumable ways

→ Host recurring meetings that the rest of the DAO can come to that enable other members to hear what explorers are learning?

→ How do non-Explorer builders relate to Explorers during the Explorers program?

→ How do Explorer program alumni’s roles change after they graduate?
    → How do alumni support the next program? At least giving detailed feedback
- Maybe we could encourage them to share their learnings with others.",
What do Juntos do / role of Junto?,→ Helping Explorers with goal setting,
Gamification,→ Can Juntos be competitive in some friendly way?,
Relationship of independent learning to internship?,"Ideally it’s related. Ideally the internship experience helps answer the research question.

Maybe the research can help explorers land the internship",
Length + intensity of program,"initially thought 6 months might be good, but might be too long especially since we need more time to plan the program AND we are already doing a lot of foundational learning through basic DAO operations

So maybe it’s more like 3.5 months (internship included)?
→ Beginning of May to mid August?
→ what happens before internship?
→ 2-2.5 month internship?

First phase of internship in may might be less time (7-10 hrs a week), but during internship it’s like full time work.",
