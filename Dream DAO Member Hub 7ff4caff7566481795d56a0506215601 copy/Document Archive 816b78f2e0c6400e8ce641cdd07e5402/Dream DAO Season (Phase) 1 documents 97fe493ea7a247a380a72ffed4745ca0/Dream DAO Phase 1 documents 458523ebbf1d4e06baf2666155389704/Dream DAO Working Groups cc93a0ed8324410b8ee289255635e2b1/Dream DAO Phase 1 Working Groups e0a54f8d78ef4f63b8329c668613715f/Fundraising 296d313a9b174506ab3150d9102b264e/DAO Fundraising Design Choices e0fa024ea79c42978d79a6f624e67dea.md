# DAO Fundraising Design Choices

<aside>
🌞 Hello! Below we will get input from Fundraising Working Group members on all sorts of questions related to fundraising (including how the wg functions).

The table is populated with questions we brainstormed together during the first WG meeting. Please feel free to add questions at the bottom (and please preface the question with your name i.e. “Gary: What color is the sky?”

Click the ➕ button at the top right of the table to add a new column and name it your name e.g. “Gary” to opine on each question.

If you like someone else’s answer, please add to the bottom of the cell with their answer, and add “<Your Name>: <your comment>” e.g. “Gary: +1” or “Gary: Love this idea. Would also like to add that...“ 

After everyone who wants to weigh in has weighed in, Lars + Gary will synthesize in advance of the second Fundraising WG meeting.

**If you have any questions about what to do in this doc, please put them in the [governance discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/896096170621947974/932070642260512818)**.
