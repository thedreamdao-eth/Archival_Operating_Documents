## General thoughts/ideas/best practices

---

- Gary: I think we really need to emphasize that engaging on social media is a valid and valuable way to contribute to the DAO.
    - How do we reward consistent contributors? Is there a badge we can create for people that engage at a certain consistency over the course of multiple months?
