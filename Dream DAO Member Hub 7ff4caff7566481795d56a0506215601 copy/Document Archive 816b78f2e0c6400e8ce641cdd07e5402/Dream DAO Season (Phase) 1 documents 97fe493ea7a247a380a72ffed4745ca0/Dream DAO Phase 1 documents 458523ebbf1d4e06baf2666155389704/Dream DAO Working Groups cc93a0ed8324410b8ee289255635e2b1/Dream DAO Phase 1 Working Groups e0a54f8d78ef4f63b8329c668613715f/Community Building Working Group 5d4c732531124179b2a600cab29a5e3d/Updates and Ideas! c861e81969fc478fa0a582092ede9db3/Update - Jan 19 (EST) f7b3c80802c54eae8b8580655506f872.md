- Working group leads created
- Database for the group established
- Setup a poll for deciding on the time for the meeting
    - Though there will be 2 meetings in the week, members are needed to attend AT LEAST ONE which suits their commitments and time zones
    - However if you happen to be an outlier (just like me) you can attend as many as you wish!
- Got two leads on Notes
    - To Charlotte and Jae-Hee: weâ€™d need help on keeping our database up-to-date with the updates like the one I made today <3
