how do you view the DAO’s mission and vision? (Try answering in not more than 5 sentences, well initially you can just ramble your thoughts and then skim through them for the answer)

**Your response:** 

## **Design new member onboarding with contributors in mind**

<aside>
💡 If you have been in web3 for quite some time, what will be an advice to your-newbie self which was introduced to web3 back then?

If you have been in web3 recently (let’s say 1-4 months), what challenges do you face in understanding what happens here?

</aside>

**Your response:** 

## **Facilitate 1:1 connections, especially early on**

<aside>
💡 Think about your role as an active member at the DAO, what things you find worth completing by most members? (like joining a call at a suitable time, or introducing themselves, etc.)

**Your response:** 

## **Invest in education and resources**

<aside>
💡 For the Dream DAO, we currently have-
     → a notes directory
     → a whitepages document
     → a contribution log
     → a nutshell document
Now delve into your experiences in Web3, availability of which resources can or would have helped you accelerate your learning journey?

</aside>

**Your response:** 

## **Accommodate for different levels of knowledge and experience**

<aside>
💡 Our goal for successful onboarding-
     → A process that is inclusive of people coming in with different amounts of knowledge and experience

Dissecting it as making room for —
      → different paths of contribution (thoughts?)
      → engagement, based on each individuals’ —
            → skills
            → interests
            → availability

How do we make different paths of contribution clear+accessible to our members? (ex. a page for ways to plug in, from answering design questions to running study group sessions)

How do we measure/identify an individuals’ skills, interests and availability in limited time?

</aside>

**Your response:** 

## **Preempt scalability challenges, especially pertaining to quality of work and “offboarding”**

<aside>
💡 Think about instances where offboarding, or structure, or both are necessary
      → For example, for CU LT#2, we had made the session available to public, a section of which later started demanding POAPs
