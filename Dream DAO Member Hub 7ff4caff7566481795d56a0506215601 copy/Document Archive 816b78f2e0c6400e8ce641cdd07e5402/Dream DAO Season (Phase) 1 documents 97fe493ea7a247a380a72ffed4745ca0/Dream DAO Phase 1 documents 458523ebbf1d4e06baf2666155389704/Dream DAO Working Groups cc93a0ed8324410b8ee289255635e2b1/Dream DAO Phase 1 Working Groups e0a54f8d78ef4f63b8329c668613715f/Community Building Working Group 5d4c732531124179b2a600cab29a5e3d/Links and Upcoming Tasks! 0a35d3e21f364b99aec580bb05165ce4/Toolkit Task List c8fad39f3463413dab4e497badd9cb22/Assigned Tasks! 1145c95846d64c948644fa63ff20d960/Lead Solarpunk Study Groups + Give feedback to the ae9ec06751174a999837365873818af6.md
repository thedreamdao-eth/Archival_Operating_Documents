# Lead Solarpunk Study Groups + Give feedback to the curriculum

Name of leads: Oliver
Support: Madhav

After we decide some bits of the curriculum in the curriculum development working group and Arman and Ash complete that task of meeting people of the dao 1:1, I will make a channel or separate thread where we could hold discourse on that resource, talk about our idea and have bi-weekly flexible meetups. 

It will be different from learning together in that we will be sharing our thoughts and ideas at any time we like and making changes to the resources if needed for the explorer’s program. The members of the study group should be committed to giving some time as it will work both as the testing ground for the material of the explorer's program and help bring a healthy culture of discussions and debate. 

Members will be encouraged to share their idea more and be flexible with discussions.

Gary’s questions:

- what resources are you discussing?
    - the ones that are decided in the curriculum development working group for the explorers program
        - is this the collection of resources for beginners (which hasn’t been compiled yet)?
            - It wont be like we will be having a goal for educating them but we want to set up a feedback loop for what we decide as being part of the explorer's program.
- is this what study groups used to be? what is happening to the study group that is currently runnning?
    - are you talking about the one TIM formed?
        - i guess
            - to be honest it's kinda dead now. I and Jae-Hee are the only ones messaging for people to chime in but no one really does
- how often are these meetings?
    - Maybe bi weekly, don't want people that they are overspending time on the DAO.
- how many groups are there?
