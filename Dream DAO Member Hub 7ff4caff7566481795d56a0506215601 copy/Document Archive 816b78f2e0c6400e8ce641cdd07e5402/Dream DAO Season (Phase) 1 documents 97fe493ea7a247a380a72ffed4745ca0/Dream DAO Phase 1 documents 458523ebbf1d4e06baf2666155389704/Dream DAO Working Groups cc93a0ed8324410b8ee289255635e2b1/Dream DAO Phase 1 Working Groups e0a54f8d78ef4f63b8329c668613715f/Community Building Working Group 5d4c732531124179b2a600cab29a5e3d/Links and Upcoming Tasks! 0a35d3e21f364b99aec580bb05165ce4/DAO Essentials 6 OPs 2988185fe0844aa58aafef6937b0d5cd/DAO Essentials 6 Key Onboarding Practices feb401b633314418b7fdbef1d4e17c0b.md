# DAO Essentials: 6 Key Onboarding Practices

**PS: If anything is not clear in the doc, pls ping @Karl(he)#2965 or @garysheng#5729 for queries :)**

# Importance of Onboarding

There are two types of members in a DAO:

1. New Members
2. Contributors

New members often become contributors after they contribute their time ‚Äòconsciously‚Äô to the DAO.

Let‚Äôs get it simple, onboarding is like providing the training and the connections to the stakeholders in an organisation. It‚Äôs like job training in the Corporate world. Except in DAO space we need to balance amidst a multitude of knowledge and skill levels, at almost the same level of willingness.

## The Question

How do we handle the overwhelming interest and willingness for good?

- It needs an understanding of
    1. The new member onboarding experience
    2. The relationship between new member onboarding and contributor onboarding

The document is based on inferring from the onboarding tactics used by DAOs with strong social and cultural components.

## Establish a clear mission and vision for the DAO

Those onboarding to the DAO should very clearly understand what the DAO is trying to accomplish and how they can fit in under the context of that goal. If the DAO were a human, then its mission would be its purpose of life! 

A clear purpose filters out people who can plug in, and who can‚Äôt. It thus reduces our time to go by the rule of thumb (aka trying and testing all the time in our lives out lol)

<aside>
üí° **Guiding question:** 
From your reading of-

- [Dream DAO In A Nutshell üåû](https://www.notion.so/Dream-DAO-In-A-Nutshell-59aa3a822b754482a99cbf787cb9d729?pvs=21)

how do you view the DAO‚Äôs mission and vision? (Try answering in not more than 5 sentences, well initially you can just ramble your thoughts and then skim through them for the answer)

</aside>

## **Design new member onboarding with contributors in mind**

Almost all contributors would have onboarded as a new member. There are a lot of people interested in stepping up and contributing, but they are not sure how and where‚Äïit‚Äôs a problem of both education and fit. Transparency helps to remove roadblocks for those who are eager to contribute.

Counting on this transparency, it manifests as-

1. Making ways to contribute- clear to all members
2. Communicating expectations for contribution
3. Contributing in low-stakes way

Quoting a few lines-

> *Additionally, many DAOs have seen that active, engaged contributors who end up in formal contributor roles are often those who spend time in working groups or particular areas of the DAO for a period of time beforehand, just without a formal contributor role. These are people who have identified their niche¬†within¬†the DAO after they join and have built a reputation as someone who knows what‚Äôs going on and can be a reliable contributor already. The path to becoming a highly involved contributor can and should be inclusive of those who are pseudonymous.*

What do you think the last underlined sentence means in our context?

üí° If you have been in web3 for quite some time, what will be an advice to your-newbie self which was introduced to web3 back then?

If you have been in web3 recently (let‚Äôs say 1-4 months), what challenges do you face in understanding what happens here + learning abt web3?
Rash: Understanding the terminology.  Time is a general problem cuz high school and college apps.
Madhav: Lack of clarity in expectations. 
Dariel: With Rashmika on this one. 
Adarsh: Plethora of notes, which to choose?
Arman: I don‚Äôt have the time, or seem to not have the time. Overwhelming amount of discord messages. We see lots of work happening in pretty less amount of time, with hardly bits of it, known by most of the builders.

## **Facilitate 1:1 connections, especially early on**

1:1 refers to new folks pairing with team members/contributors of the DAO for a conversation. They help ensure that new members are aligned with the DAO‚Äôs purpose and create a stickiness factor for member retention and engagement. Conducting a 1:1 call with each new member is manual and difficult to efficiently scale, but it‚Äôs a worthy investment into the community.¬†**It allows context and culture to disseminate past the core contributors to other active members of the DAO.**¬†This can evolve into a peer-to-peer process over time as more members understand what‚Äôs going on.

There can be different dimensions of these 1:1 calls:

- *Mentor/buddy system*: Each new member is paired with a currently active member of the community. (We are currently doing this at the Intros Club!)
- *Cohort-based onboarding*: Each new cohort is a part of a ‚Äúclass‚Äù and accomplishes projects or tasks together as a form of bonding (This can be an option in the coming phases)
- *Task checklists*: Each new member must complete a small list of tasks (eg. introducing themselves, joining a community call, completing a bounty, and/or messaging a core contributor) (directly helps people being onboarded with a basic understanding of work here and of Web3)

<aside>
üí° Think about your role as an active member at the DAO, what things you find worth completing by most members? (like joining a call at a suitable time, or introducing themselves, etc.)

Reward System: Incentivises the need to know what‚Äôs happening in the DAO + get the work done according to what they love and what they are/can be good at (cc: Rashmika, Gary)
Rashmika: most underrated way- Chats, even if it doesn‚Äôt make sense, as if like I am not a robot 
Arman: CHATS, yes Rashmika!
Madhav: Collaborating on shared goals‚Äîlike research on L2 rollups +  recently engaged in twitter thread, jamming on ideas, it felt really cool‚Äî coz we get to connect with each other. With a shared perspective‚Äî review things by getting ti viewed by people not involved.
Rashmika: We need background info for this kinda work.
Adarsh: Start appreciating people, feedback systems
      ‚Üí HeyTaco Bot, Words based appreciation, Twitter Mentions/posts/likes
Arman: Events like Gaming nights

</aside>

## **Invest in education and resources**

Clarity is crucial for community engagement. Having the whitepapers, design docs and documentation accessible to the members at the right time makes it easier for them to plug in. These resources are very useful when provided in tandem with new member programming.

Making things transparent is a social incentive in itself!

<aside>
üí° For the Dream DAO, we currently have-
     ‚Üí a notes directory
     ‚Üí a whitepages document
     ‚Üí a contribution log
     ‚Üí a nutshell document
Now delve into your experiences in Web3, availability of which resources can or would have helped you accelerate your learning journey?

Madhav: GitCoin- Basic Homepage that led to everything. I think we need a whole page that has got the links + get the people aware abt it + abt how to use that
Arman: Agree on this! Odyssey DAO intro to web3
Adarsh:  I can send a link in #community-building

</aside>

## **Accommodate for different levels of knowledge and experience**

Centralisation occurs when there are a few who have the power and the awareness to do something, right?

Decentralisation is the existence of DAOs, and that can‚Äôt happen without respecting the diversity of-

- Contribution levels
- Knowledge levels (aka experience in Web3)
- Comfort levels (aka availability)

possessed by the members in a DAO.

<aside>
üí° Our goal for successful onboarding-
     ‚Üí A process that is inclusive of people coming in with different amounts of knowledge and experience

Dissecting it as making room for ‚Äî
      ‚Üí different paths of contribution (thoughts?)
      ‚Üí engagement, based on each individuals‚Äô ‚Äî
            ‚Üí skills
            ‚Üí interests
            ‚Üí availability

How do we make different paths of contribution clear+accessible to our members? (ex. a page for ways to plug in, from answering design questions to running study group sessions)
Rashmika: This should get better when the phase 2 rolls out with the EP, cuz by then we will have a mentoring system + more clarity on how we learn about + plug into the intersection of Web3 + Social Impact
Arman: Culture + Connections + COntribution ; having different paths of collaboration

How do we measure/identify an individuals‚Äô skills, interests and availability in limited time?

</aside>

## **Preempt scalability challenges, especially pertaining to quality of work and ‚Äúoffboarding‚Äù**

Meaning of offboarding: the process that leads to the formal separation between a member and an organisation through resignation, termination, or retirement. It encompasses all the decisions and processes that take place when an member leaves.

To summarise this onboarding practice in a nutshell:

> *When there are many members who are working on different projects and initiatives, who should make sure the quality of work meets the standard of the DAO‚Äôs mission and ethos?*
> 

Flexibility and permissionlessness must be guided by some form of structure to ensure internal alignment and operational efficiency. **Structure is especially important in instances when members don‚Äôt follow community guidelines or aren‚Äôt aligned with the DAO‚Äôs mission and operations.**

We often rely on this structure to offboard members in the above mentioned instances. According to the DAOs researched, it‚Äôs easier to offboard people when guardrails are created and implemented early on.

How doe sit look like and stuff.
