## Working Group General Discussions ðŸ¥³

(Saf) A weekly hangout/reflection/mental health check-in session - can be led by anyone thatâ€™s interested (from the community WG or otherwise), just an opportunity to talk about how youâ€™re feeling and non-Dream DAO related stuff

(Arman) This is a great way to connect! We can have QOTDs on a routine basis and storytelling nights once in a week or two!

(Saf) ^ Love this!
