How this is different than our Twitter,Gary,"I think there should be posts that are UNIQUE to our Instagram, so there is incentive to post them there."

"Dream Journal Graphic ","Madison ",Could repurpose some parts of the Dream Journal to turn into a graphic that is easy to share on both Instagram + Twitter
WTF is going in the dao,Amanda,does everyone has access to the 'wtf is going on in dream dao'? the email that jae have been sending? maybe we could turn into a newsletter/insta post (reels maybe) or twitter thread for everyone even people outside the dao to keep up
