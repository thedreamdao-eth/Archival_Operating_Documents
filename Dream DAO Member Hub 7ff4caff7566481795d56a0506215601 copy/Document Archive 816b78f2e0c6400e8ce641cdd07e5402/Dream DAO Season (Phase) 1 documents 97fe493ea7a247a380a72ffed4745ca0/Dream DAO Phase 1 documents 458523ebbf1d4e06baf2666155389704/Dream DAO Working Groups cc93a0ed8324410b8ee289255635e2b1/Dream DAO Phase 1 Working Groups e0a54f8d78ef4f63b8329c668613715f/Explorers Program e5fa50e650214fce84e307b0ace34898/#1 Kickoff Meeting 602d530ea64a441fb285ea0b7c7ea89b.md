    üö® **Gary sent in our discord this message:** I want us to noodle on the question of the timeline of the explorers program
    - we could launch in something like april and do a longer program that is less intense (5-6 months)
    - we could do a more intensive 2.5 month program that launches in summer that people can do DEEPLY during a great internship.

### üß† Brainstorm over the key results

1. **How can we reach Phase 1 Goals?** 
- **Goal:** Developing a Catalog of Effective Educational Programs to Take Inspiration from
    
    Responses:
    
    - **we should look into web3 education programs like...**
        - crypto, culture, and society ones
        - Kernel
        - Consensys Solidity Bootcamp
    - **we should look into non-web3 education programs like...**
        - CU Fellowship (leadership blueprint)
        - GCY Academy
        - Ivy House
        - OnDeck
        - Dorm Room Fund style

- **dimensions of the programs we should study**
    - How do they deliver the content
    - How did they create community
    - From learning to transformation
    - Selection process (how do we keep community even if not selected)
    - Mentorship
    - Program deliverables/capstone
    - Hands-on learning (projects etc)
- Someone should take lead on creating a catalog of a dozen+ programs
- individuals with experience can write down what they know about each program
- Can our Explorers Program directly integrate other programs? COLLABS are key
- we can interview alumni from the programs

- **Goal:** Identify the tech tools that are relevant for the Explorers Program
    
    Responses:
    
    - What kinds of tools do we need?
        - these relate to the needs / objectives of the program
        - regardless, we need to have a hub for the content / members / roadmap, etc

- **Goal:** Potential Internship Hosts + How to contact/bring them to this project
    
    Responses:
    
    - We should create an easy way for the whole Dream DAO community to suggest / put in potential hosts and note that they have a contact there
    - We should create email templates so people can easily do outreach to recruit internship spots
    - We should think through criteria for internships‚Äîwe must have a high standard for the internships
    - How are we matching?
    - Explorers should probably be able to find their dream internship site

- **Goal:** Design Choices (length, session formats, mentorship system)
    
    Responses: [](Design%20Choices%20to%20Figure%20out%20e955e01b50574b188d104ce58a6fdcaa.md) 
    

- **Goal:** Whitepages + Application
    
    Responses:
    
    - Once we feel good about the design choices, we will do this
    - This documentation should help other program developers create their programs
    - Reflections on how the pilot program went should go in this documentation
