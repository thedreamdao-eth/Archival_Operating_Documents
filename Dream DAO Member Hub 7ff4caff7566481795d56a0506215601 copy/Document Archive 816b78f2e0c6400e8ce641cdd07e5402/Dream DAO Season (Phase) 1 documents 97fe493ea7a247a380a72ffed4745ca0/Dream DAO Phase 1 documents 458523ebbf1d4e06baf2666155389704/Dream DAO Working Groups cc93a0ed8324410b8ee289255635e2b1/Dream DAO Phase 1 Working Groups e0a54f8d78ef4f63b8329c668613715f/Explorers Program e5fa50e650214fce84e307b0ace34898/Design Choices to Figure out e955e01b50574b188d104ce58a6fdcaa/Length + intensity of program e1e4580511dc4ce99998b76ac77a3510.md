# Length + intensity of program

Tentative thoughts as a group: initially thought 6 months might be good, but might be too long especially since we need more time to plan the program AND we are already doing a lot of foundational learning through basic DAO operations

So maybe it’s more like 3.5 months (internship included)?
→ Beginning of May to mid August?
→ what happens before internship?
→ 2-2.5 month internship?

First phase of internship in may might be less time (7-10 hrs a week), but during internship it’s like full time work.
