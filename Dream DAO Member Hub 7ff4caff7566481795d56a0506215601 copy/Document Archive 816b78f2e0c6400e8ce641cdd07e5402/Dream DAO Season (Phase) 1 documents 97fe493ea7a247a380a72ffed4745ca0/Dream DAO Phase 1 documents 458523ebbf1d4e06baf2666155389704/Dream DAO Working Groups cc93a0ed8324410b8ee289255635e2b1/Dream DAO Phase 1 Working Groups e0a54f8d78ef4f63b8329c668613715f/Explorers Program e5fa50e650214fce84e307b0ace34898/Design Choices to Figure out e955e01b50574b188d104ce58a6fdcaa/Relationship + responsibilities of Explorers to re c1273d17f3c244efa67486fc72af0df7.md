# Relationship + responsibilities of Explorers to rest of DAO / web3

Tentative thoughts as a group: → Share their research in consumable ways

→ Host recurring meetings that the rest of the DAO can come to that enable other members to hear what explorers are learning?

→ How do non-Explorer builders relate to Explorers during the Explorers program?

→ How do Explorer program alumni’s roles change after they graduate?
    → How do alumni support the next program? At least giving detailed feedback
- Maybe we could encourage them to share their learnings with others.
