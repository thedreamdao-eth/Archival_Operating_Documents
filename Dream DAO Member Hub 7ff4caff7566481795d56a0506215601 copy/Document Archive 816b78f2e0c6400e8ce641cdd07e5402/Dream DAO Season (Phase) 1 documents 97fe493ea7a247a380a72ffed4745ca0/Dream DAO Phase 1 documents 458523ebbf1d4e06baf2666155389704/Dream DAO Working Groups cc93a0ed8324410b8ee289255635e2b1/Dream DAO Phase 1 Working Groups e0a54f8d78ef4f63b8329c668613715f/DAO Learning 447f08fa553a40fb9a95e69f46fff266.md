## Working Group Ideas

---

**Jason:** Learn & Earn - Can we leverage web2 technologies or existing platforms to fund explorers education? Goal not to be a carrot at the end of a stick but more as providing their basic needs so they can devote their time to their interests/learnings
i.e. Can we host our curriculum on youtube and push for monetization of the channel and funnel all profits back to the students?

**Jae-Hee:** I love this idea!! Also helps democratize web3 education across non-web3 platforms/access points.

**Jae-Hee:** Perhaps even integrate mini-lessons into social media-compatible mediums? Just a thought.

**Charlotte:** I like this idea; I think it would also bring people into the community.

**Madhav**: What if we introduce new web3 decentralized platforms to students by hosting our resources and teachings there. When someone uses something they feel more connected to it and it would help us show that web3 isn't just speculation but the new internet is being built right now. 

**Jason:** Thesis based curriculum modeled after grad school style. Initial essential classes followed by a build your own curriculum to help pursue the end goal of a thesis

**Jae-Hee:** Wondering if the thesis could be centered around that idea of web3 x social impact in particular? 

**Jason:** Regenerative curriculum - As web3 continually gains tractions and rapidly expands the curriculum can grow stale or narrow in scope. As explorers move through this program can we have them contribute or expand the curriculum? 

**Jae-Hee:** We’re on the same brainwave! I mentioned something like this in the Dream DAO Whitepaper! :D

I.e. Discussions or learnings are recorded and if useful can be added to curriculum. If we go with a thesis can we have the explorer create a learnings doc and a presentation of it that can be added to the curriculum as well?

**Madhav:**  No kidding but I was thinking of the same thing. Most of the explorers won't stick to just what we help them learn but as they are explorer’s they will venture and find new stuff on their own which could defiantly help us grow too.

**Jae-Hee:** To bolster the social impact dimension + ground our learning in real-world issues, weave in some elements of ethics, history, economics, sociology?

**Oliver:** I definitely think weaving in these things is important. I think it benefits us by 1) making real-world connections to web3 and 2) expanding people's current passions in relation to web3. Web3 has a lot of complexity so connecting it to other learning areas could give people a boost. 

**Allison:** Yes! I agree, adding on the aspect of topics/issues that the Explorers’ are interested in leveraging web3 to help them advance toward social impact will definitely give them plenty of insight! 

**Charlotte:** I really think this is important.  We need people in program that understand the context and implications of web3 on a large scale.

**Safder:** Is it fair to have assignments/homework etc? Is it a good idea to assign grades (or Pass/Fail or Credit/D/F) and require participants to meet a certain standard to “graduate” from the program? 

**Safder:** Maybe even a final “capstone project” where Explorers divide into groups to build something under the guidance of a Champion? 

**Allison:** I would say that the “capstone project” under the guidance of a Champion would be more beneficial. I don’t think homework would be a good idea, especially since I personally think that it would drain their motivation of actually learning the ins and outs of web3 and view the program as “passing the test” etc. 

**Charlotte:** I agree that “homework” may do more harm than good.  The capstone project and braindrops outlined in the whitepaper seem like ways to stay accountable and involved.

**Madhav:** I think the Homework word would put a mental burden on the mind of the explorer. A capstone project is a way to go to show how one has learned over the course of the program as Gary outlined in the whitepaper and the idea of Bi-weekly Briandrop)also in the white paper) could work as a testing space where explorers could learn about their weakness and strenght.
