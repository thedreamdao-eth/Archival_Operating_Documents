Why applying?: I've been a part of Dream DAO since the beggining of our journey. I've loved seeing this community grow and flower into the family it is today. I'd like to be a bigger part of this by becoming an explorer. The untapped potential of web3 is what attracted me to this space in the first place. I've seen people do some really cool and amazing, impact-creating stuff in my short time here and would love to explore it more
