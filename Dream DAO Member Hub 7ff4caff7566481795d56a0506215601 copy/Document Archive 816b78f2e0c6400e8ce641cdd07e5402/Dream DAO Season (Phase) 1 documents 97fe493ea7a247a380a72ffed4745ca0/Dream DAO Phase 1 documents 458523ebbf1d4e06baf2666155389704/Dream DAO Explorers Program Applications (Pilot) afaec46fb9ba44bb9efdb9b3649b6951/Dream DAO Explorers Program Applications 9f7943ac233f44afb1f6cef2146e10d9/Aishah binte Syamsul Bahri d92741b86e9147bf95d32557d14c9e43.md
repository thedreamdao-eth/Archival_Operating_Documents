# Aishah binte Syamsul Bahri

Demonstrated commitment: Usually in dream dao, I would attend learning together session. with guest speakers and help out in various working groups.  

I have experience being in a community working group, looking at conflict resolution systems, how to engage community through events etc. I do either note taking or twitter recaps for documentation WG. Under governance I've worked with champions with the task compensation system and also been aiding with starting a dream dao blog post for their mirror account.

I also have been networking with other individuals in dream dao and to me is also a great learning avenue 
Anything else: The timezone can be a really huge constrain. I live in utc +8

And to end off, I'm always open to learn new areas in web3 space! 

Thank you! 
Ideal host sites: If possible I would really love to contribute with SheFi as it is a women based community focusing on defi and education. I truly love that The SheFi community is anchored in the values of openness, kindness, diversity, inclusion, equity, curiosity. Which is a community I wish to be part of!! 
What you can contribute?: Outside of the space, I have been in various leadership roles; the most current would be the executive committee of entrepreneurship, managing projects, and the founder of a club in my school where we focus on developing and teaching sustainable fashion. 

In addition, I'm currently a year two student pursuing a diploma in accountancy and finance

My skills mainly lies in Project Management, interpersonal skills, and leadership 

I can mainly contribute my time and the constant spirit to learn and do! 
Why applying?: Being a dream dao explorer was not an easy decision to make at all. The lack of confidence in the web3 space and huge commitments outside played a huge factor of hindrance for me. Sure enough, I still found myself filling out the application form again. 

One of the biggest reasons why I'm excited to join the explorer's program is the opportunity to learn and understand how other DAOs operate. So far, I've only had the pleasure of being involved in dream dao, and as truly amazing dream dao is, it's time to explore the various Daos and utilitise the knowledge and skills I've gained from being in Dream Dao to other Daos.

Being frank, the whole Web3 space is still developing, I'm excited to see how much we can achieve and help humanity.
