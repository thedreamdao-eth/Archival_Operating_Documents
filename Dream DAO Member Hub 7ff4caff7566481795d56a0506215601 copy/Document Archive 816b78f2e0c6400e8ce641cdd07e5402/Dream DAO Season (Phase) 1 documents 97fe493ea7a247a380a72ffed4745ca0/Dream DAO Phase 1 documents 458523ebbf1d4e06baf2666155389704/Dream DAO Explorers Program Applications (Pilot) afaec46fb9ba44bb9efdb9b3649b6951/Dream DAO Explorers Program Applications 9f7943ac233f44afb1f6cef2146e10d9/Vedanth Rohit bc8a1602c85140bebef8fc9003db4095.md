Arpeggi Labs- as a musician myself, I love having a platform like arpeggi where i can make my own music and sell it!

Creator Cabin!!!! I love the idea of taking web3 irl with the summer camp like vibe!
What you can contribute?: Efficient with Google products+ Notion+ Canva
Otherways I could contribute are with social media work and admin work like support and mod too!
Why applying?: It's the main reason I became a Dream DAO builder! When I was reading through the Dream Paper I remember spotting the explorer's program and was like it would be really to be a part of such a program that connects you to other organizations in order to gain exposure! In the beginning, I was very skeptical of web3 even though I had a limited amount of knowledge about it, but now after living in this spce for the past 6 months, I've really started to see the kind of change it can bring to our continually breaking systems.
