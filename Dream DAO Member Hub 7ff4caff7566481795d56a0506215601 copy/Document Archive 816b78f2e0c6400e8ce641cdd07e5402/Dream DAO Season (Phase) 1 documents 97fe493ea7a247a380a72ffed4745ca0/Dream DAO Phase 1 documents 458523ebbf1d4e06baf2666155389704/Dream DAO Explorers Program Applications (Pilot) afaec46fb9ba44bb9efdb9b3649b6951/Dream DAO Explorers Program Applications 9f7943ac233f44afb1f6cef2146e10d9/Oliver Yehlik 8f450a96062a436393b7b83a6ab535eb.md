# Oliver Yehlik

Demonstrated commitment: - Attending 20 Learning Together sessions
- Organizing and participating in the Solarpunk Study Group
- Speaking on Twitter spaces such as SunGens, Gitcoin, Future Foundation
- Hosting and participating in The Rendezvous event with George PÃ³r on increasing aliveness for movements with web3 tools
- Publishing my own writing on Mirror

- Active in Community Building and DAO Learning working groups
Ideal host sites: I would like to contribute to All for Climate DAO, the SunGens, and any imagination activism work related to Solarpunk Academy/Tools for the Regen Renaissance/Moral Imaginations.
What you can contribute?: One skill I have is connecting my contributions with my own sense of purpose and values. Bringing this purpose to my projects helps me stay intrinsically motivated. I also strive to form connections with others, my experiences, and my learning in order to be fully present and inform my work from a wider lens.
Why applying?: I think what excites me most about web3 are the "unknown unknowns" and the people seeking them out. As such a recent and expansive tool, web3 has many undiscovered implications for how humans interact with each other and the world around us. By continually reimagining the frames we use to navigate the space, we can explore what these unknowns might be and begin to make sense of them. As a Dream DAO Explorer, I can continue contributing to the intersections that interest me within the context of "being on the edge of what is possible/known."
