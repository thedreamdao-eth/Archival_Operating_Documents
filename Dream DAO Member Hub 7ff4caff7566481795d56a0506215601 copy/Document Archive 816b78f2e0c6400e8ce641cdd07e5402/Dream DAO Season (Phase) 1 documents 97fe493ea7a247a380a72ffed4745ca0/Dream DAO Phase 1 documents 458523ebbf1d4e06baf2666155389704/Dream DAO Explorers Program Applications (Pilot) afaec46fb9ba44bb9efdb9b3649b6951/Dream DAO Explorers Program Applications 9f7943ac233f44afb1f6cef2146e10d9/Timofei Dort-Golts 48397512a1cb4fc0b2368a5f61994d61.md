# Timofei Dort-Golts

Demonstrated commitment: I have shown my commitment by:

1. Bringing value to Dream DAO through successful coordination of the Governance WG and Leading the Blog Initiative - persistent roles I have, while also contributing to it by completing one-off tasks like searching for partners, POAP delivery, and manual creation.

2. Evangelizing the web3 space and Dream DAO among the CU Fellows during the Bonfires (to spark interest).

3. Exploring the outer web3:
- By talking to LT hosts like Elliott and George (technoshaman) to get some more knowledge about their projects, thoughts, and opinions on the web3 space;
- By getting engaged in communities like MetaAngels, MisfitRobots, SunGens, and Code Green
- By helping the web3verse community grow big and help even more aspiring solidity devs!
- By trying to be more active on Twitter and engage in interesting conversations to potentially help the Dream DAO grow!
- By participating in the Crypto Newbies podcast talking about the Dream DAO

Anything else: Would be amazing if there will be some guidance by the org's team initially, so I can bring more value to the org faster!

Why applying?: I am determined to build a career in web3 since I started to understand it's potential effect on achieving my dreams and helping my loved ones and myself have a sustainable living!

I understand that the impact of the Explorers Program on my future career is immense due to the real work experience, future employment potential (if the internship host will like me as an intern), and work experience in the web3-native org for my web3 resume as a cherry on top!

I think that the best way to learn is through action and diving head on in the epicenter of what interests me! (Well, thanks to Dream DAO it became my favorite way to learn, too!) 
Because of my experience in the Governance WG and Dream DAO as a whole, I'm certain that even though I may not have a formal educaton to work on something, I have a lot of experience (related to the skills and experiences I've listed answeing to the question above + some other programs) to make up for it.
But more importantly, I'm able and willing to learn what I don't yet know through adapting, taking action & initiative, asking honest questions, and not being afraid to search for advice! 

That's why I know that the Explorers Program is right for me and will help me achieve my Dreams!
