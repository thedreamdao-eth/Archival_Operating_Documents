Timofei Dort-Golts,"I have shown my commitment by:

1. Bringing value to Dream DAO through successful coordination of the Governance WG and Leading the Blog Initiative - persistent roles I have, while also contributing to it by completing one-off tasks like searching for partners, POAP delivery, and manual creation.

2. Evangelizing the web3 space and Dream DAO among the CU Fellows during the Bonfires (to spark interest).

3. Exploring the outer web3:
- By talking to LT hosts like Elliott and George (technoshaman) to get some more knowledge about their projects, thoughts, and opinions on the web3 space;
- By getting engaged in communities like MetaAngels, MisfitRobots, SunGens, and Code Green
- By helping the web3verse community grow big and help even more aspiring solidity devs!
- By trying to be more active on Twitter and engage in interesting conversations to potentially help the Dream DAO grow!
- By participating in the Crypto Newbies podcast talking about the Dream DAO
","I am determined to build a career in web3 since I started to understand it's potential effect on achieving my dreams and helping my loved ones and myself have a sustainable living!

I understand that the impact of the Explorers Program on my future career is immense due to the real work experience, future employment potential (if the internship host will like me as an intern), and work experience in the web3-native org for my web3 resume as a cherry on top!

I think that the best way to learn is through action and diving head on in the epicenter of what interests me! (Well, thanks to Dream DAO it became my favorite way to learn, too!) 
Because of my experience in the Governance WG and Dream DAO as a whole, I'm certain that even though I may not have a formal educaton to work on something, I have a lot of experience (related to the skills and experiences I've listed answeing to the question above + some other programs) to make up for it.
But more importantly, I'm able and willing to learn what I don't yet know through adapting, taking action & initiative, asking honest questions, and not being afraid to search for advice! 

That's why I know that the Explorers Program is right for me and will help me achieve my Dreams!","I have skills and experience in:
- Team Management (Dream DAO Governance WG )
- Project Management (Dream DAO BLog + Many different project management competitions / personal initiatives)
- Community Building (Dream DAO)
- Initiative taking (I can propose / take lead on projects that have some potential for the organization)
- Product QAing + advices (From being a Game Design Advisor in Read to Lead)

My most valualbe skills are:
- Leadership
- Adaptivity
- Resilience
- Public speaking & Presenting / Pitching

Vedanth Rohit,"Yup! I've been very active within the Dream DAO community, have been part of a number of proposals and projects as well","I've been a part of Dream DAO since the beggining of our journey. I've loved seeing this community grow and flower into the family it is today. I'd like to be a bigger part of this by becoming an explorer. The untapped potential of web3 is what attracted me to this space in the first place. I've seen people do some really cool and amazing, impact-creating stuff in my short time here and would love to explore it more","Writing skills

Amanda Garcia Maritan,"I have been in the DAO Learning working group as a contributor and co-leading with Allison, as well as attending LT sessions, and helping with Twitter recap threads and notes inside the Documentation WG. On my own, I do read the notes and threads from LT sessions I missed + watch the recordings, as well as read articles and news surrounding the web3 space. I will also take part as a Dream DAO blogger during the coming weeks, sharing my experience in DD until now.
","In 2019 I took a vocational course run by psychologists that uses Holland’s personality theory. After 9 months of studies, we concluded that my personality fits the Enterprising Artistic type. However, besides fitting (theoretically) the entrepreneurship area, I have never been interested in this side until getting into web3. Since I came to the DAO and discovered the coordination, management, and operations side of a web3 org I have become more open and interested in exploring this career pathway as long as it happens inside the web3 space. I want to become a Dream DAO explorer not only to have a deeper knowledge about web3, and for being a fan of hands-on-working experience as a learning method, but also to experience through an internship the operations side of a web3 x social impact org, whilst in a Gap Year preparing for college applications, and help me understand and re-discover this important decision (career pathway) I might have to re-take until the end of the year. 

When it comes to what excites me the most about web 3 are the opportunities. When it comes to abroad opportunities, as a Brazilian, everything is limited (resources, opportunities, money) or too much (requirements, bureaucracy, experience), so is very hard to achieve this goal of taking part in international projects/organizations/opportunities. Web3 just makes all of this easier, welcoming, and allows us to learn while we take action; is much more accessible. I feel like this is the ‘’allowing those that are very interested and have potential but can’t fill standardized requirements when it comes to web2’’. Everyone is learning together and contributing, and there’s space for all kinds of interests and skills. I simply adore this. 
","I believe I can contribute with my written communication skills, creativity, and attention to detail when it comes to soft skills. I do write a lot (essays, dissertations, articles, and creative writing), this can be very supportive when it comes to orgs’ communications roles/areas + I have been in the theater (as an actress and creator) and I improved a lot my teamworking and interpersonal skills, as well as problem-solving and creativity. I do know how to deal with documentation and meetings. I have been developing project proposal + pitching skills in my GCYA experience. I’m organized and resilient, eager for new experiences, and an easy learner. My curiosity and love for challenges allow me to do stuff I never actually learned about before because it incentives me to look forward to the new and necessary knowledge needed to accomplish the task by myself.
","Celo Foundation, for being aligned with my values and ideas when it comes to social issues, especially the prosperity approach they have. As a passionate person about sociology studies, I have been debating, researching, and studying a lot when it comes to developing not just financial, but also life prosperity, when it comes to certain communities, from the social sciences point of view. I would love to contribute to Celo’s mission as well as take a step in how they use the web3 space to act in such a broad and difficult issue which is the lack of financial prosperity for most of us in our capitalist world.

FWB (friends with benefits) launched the FWB Fellowship to support artistic creators and thinkers in web3, I would be very interested in interning inside the operations (working group) of the fellowship.
",,"I would really enjoy interning in the management/operations side of an organization, or even in communications. I am also open to research, I am not tech-savvy, but I do like to learn and explore different topics related to the environment, social causes, and future thinking.",
Shreya Devaram,"I have demonstrated a commitment to learning and contributing to the web3 x social impact space through my contributions at Dream DAO. I've demonstrated a commitment to learning not only by attending several Learning Together sessions, but also spreading the knowledge I learned by taking notes and writting Twitter recap threads for some LT sessions. I've also supplemented my learning by looking into other resources such as Odyssey DAO. Other ways that I've contributed to Dream DAO include: Running the Member of the Day Initiative, co-writing an election design doc + setting up the election committee, working on a community health action plan, working on a partnership with Evita DAO, writing blogs for the Dream DAO blog, providing feedback on ideas and proposals, and I'm going to be joining the Dream DAO Journal team soon. ","Being a Dream DAO explorer would allow me to get real world experience in web3 by directly contributing to organizations in the space. Hands on and project-based learning is the best way to learn something, because reading notes can only do so much. I would also like to see how I can apply what I've learned in the Dream DAO over the past few months to help another organization in some way. I also like the idea of creating a learning artifact as a way to teach people about what you learned from the internship experience, because it helps us stay accountable to continually learning new things. There also isn't anything like the explorers program available anywhere else, so it would be a great privilege to be able to participate in it. A lot of things excite me about web3! The regen mindset, solarpunk, lunarpunk, greenpilling stuff, public goods creation, getting to work with people who are really passionate about web3, the incredible DAOs in the social impact space, and just how new and accessible the space is. I can go on and on about how much I'm passionate about web3! However, the thing that excites me about web3 the most is getting to see the collective power of hard working and passionate individuals in creating social impact. ","Some skills that I have that can be helpful to a web3 organization are discord management (handling support team tickets and moderation), writing/content creation (writing blog posts on Mirror/Substack and content creation for Twitter + social media management), and community building (hosting hangouts and finding ways to cultivate community on Discord and Twitter). Some other ways that I could contribute to a web3 organization is by helping to write proposals, hosting sessions for beginners in web3 or contributing to guides that focus on learning about web3, joining working groups and working as a contributor for their projects, creating public goods, podcast creation, and I can help out with partnerships. ","One regen web3 organization that I'd like to contribute to is Gitcoin. Gitcoin is at the forefront of working towards creating a digital public infrastructure for tomorrow theough funding projects, teaching people about crypto and web3, and building a community of people from around the world that are passionate about regen, public goods creation, and web3 in general! It's one of the first web3 organizations that truly opened my eyes to all of the innovation that can spring from investing in regens and hard working + passionate people in web3. Additionally, I also started reading the Greenpilled book by Kevin Owocki and it's such an insightful read! All of these reasons and more are why I would absolutely love to work at Gitcoin. Additionally, I'm also interested in Odyssey DAO, Buildspace, Protein, and Evita DAO. ",,"I will have school until June 14th, so I'll be able to only work afterschool for the majority of June. The afternoon and evening is the best time for me to work during the Summer. ",
Madhav Goyal,"I have been contributing to Dream DAO since its start in governance, partnerships, daily tasks, and onboarding new people to it.Dream Dao has been central to my web3 experience.

I am a part of the gitcoin dao and helping folks in taking notes and publishing the ideas to reach more people. I am a gitcoin library scholar and looking forward to contributing to it more.

Working on building a catalogue of open web3 resources to board people to the world of blockchain through regen crypto ideas.  regen.today 

Since joining the Dream dao web3 has been occupying the biggest part of my mental space and been captivated by the ways i could add value to the ecosystem, I have been reading books, listening to podcasts and talking to folks in web3 for some time and it has been one of the most regarding activities I have done. ","Dream DAO introduced me to the concept of regenerative cryptonomics and what would a solarpunk future could like when web3 is leveraged as a force for good, its the vision of the of the Dream dao coupled with other inspiring people that excites me about being  a builder helping build the decentralized future. 
Web3 is all about optimism that we can change the world for good and make more fair world and I bought this idea a while ago. I want to learn new skills and make some real world impact with my work which can be unlocked by explorers program and the opportunity it would provide to builders like me. I want to explore web3 world and still having my roots in the dream dao because its like a fuel for me which energizes me with good and regen vibes. 
I want to build something that adds value to Humanity even though it might not be that big but still have a positive impact and web3 just seems the right tool and community for that. ","I  am a python programmer and have good experience with machine learning and data science libraries like Tensorflow, Pytorch , Sklearn , Pandas etc. 
I have a general understanding of solidity and am learning by building dapps. 
Asking good questions and bringing in diverse opinions is one of my superpowers, the wisdom I have gained after reading more than a 100 books is useful for systems thinking.

When I was reading through the Dream Paper I remember spotting the explorer's program and was like it would be really to be a part of such a program that connects you to other organizations in order to gain exposure! In the beginning, I was very skeptical of web3 even though I had a limited amount of knowledge about it, but now after living in this spce for the past 6 months, I've really started to see the kind of change it can bring to our continually breaking systems.","Efficient with Google products+ Notion+ Canva

"Aishah binte Syamsul Bahri ","Usually in dream dao, I would attend learning together session. with guest speakers and help out in various working groups.  

I have experience being in a community working group, looking at conflict resolution systems, how to engage community through events etc. I do either note taking or twitter recaps for documentation WG. Under governance I've worked with champions with the task compensation system and also been aiding with starting a dream dao blog post for their mirror account.

I also have been networking with other individuals in dream dao and to me is also a great learning avenue ","Being a dream dao explorer was not an easy decision to make at all. The lack of confidence in the web3 space and huge commitments outside played a huge factor of hindrance for me. Sure enough, I still found myself filling out the application form again. 

One of the biggest reasons why I'm excited to join the explorer's program is the opportunity to learn and understand how other DAOs operate. So far, I've only had the pleasure of being involved in dream dao, and as truly amazing dream dao is, it's time to explore the various Daos and utilitise the knowledge and skills I've gained from being in Dream Dao to other Daos.

Being frank, the whole Web3 space is still developing, I'm excited to see how much we can achieve and help humanity. 
","Outside of the space, I have been in various leadership roles; the most current would be the executive committee of entrepreneurship, managing projects, and the founder of a club in my school where we focus on developing and teaching sustainable fashion.

As such a recent and expansive tool, web3 has many undiscovered implications for how humans interact with each other and the world around us. By continually reimagining the frames we use to navigate the space, we can explore what these unknowns might be and begin to make sense of them. As a Dream DAO Explorer, I can continue contributing to the intersections that interest me within the context of ""being on the edge of what is possible/known.""","One skill I have is connecting my contributions with my own sense of purpose and values. Bringing this purpose to my projects helps me stay intrinsically motivated. I also strive to form connections with others, my experiences, and my learning in order to be fully present and inform my work from a wider lens.","I would like to contribute to All for Climate DAO, the SunGens, and any imagination activism work related to Solarpunk Academy/Tools for the Regen Renaissance/Moral Imaginations.",,,
Ash Kranti,"Web3 has become a key part of my life since I started in the ecosystem with Dream DAO back in December 2021. At the time, I was recovering from severe burnout in traditional nonprofit organizing and looking for something fresh to energize me. I started by observing the DAO and creating thank-you notes for our Learning Together sessions, and have rapidly expanded towards developing plans for wellness in the DAO, co-writing grant applications, authoring over 5 successful proposals, and forging a major partnership with Mems, an NFT project. Outside of Dream DAO, I’ve contributed to Protein and participated in educational courses, including the Astro Girls mentorship program and Crypto College (by Late Checkout). Independently, I've built a Twitter following on my core philosophies of ""existing in public"" and ""solving for joy."" Most recently, through my connections on Twitter and eloquent writing skills, I was considered as a top candidate for an assistant position with Jackson Dame before their break from publicity. This summer, I plan to continue exploring all things people and relationships in web3. While web3 may be ""trustless"" financially, DAOs are a huge human experiment that I continue to explore daily.","The generosity and care I’ve experienced in web3 have reinvigorated my sense of hope, taking me from one of my worst periods of burnout to living my best life. Through the Explorers Program, I hope to grow my network in the space and emphasize the human experience in the ever-evolving tech that built the industry. Continuing to connect with people who regenerate me is my biggest priority; I'm eager to soak up information and experiences wherever I go.","Coordination and storytelling are my two superpowers when it comes to web3; I've connnected with folks accross the space with ease and develop narratives outside of web3 with GSA Network and Civics Unplugged. Additionally, I have experience in communications and product roles; I worked as Community Liaison at a startup (SHE.community), managing our services and connections for over a month last year and United Northwest Side, a local community organization where I've coordinated parts of our endorsement process and social media communications for over a year. I'd like to work on onboarding and accessibility wherever I go, but I'm open to variety of roles. ",I'm interested in working with Regen Network; the way they've revolutionized climate coordination astonishes me. I'd love to upgrade their storytelling and support them in making regenerative finance accessible to all.,,"In case you're interested, I've attached answers to a few questions from previous job applications that specifically struck me. Thank your for your consideration!

What’s your experience with asynchronous communication and remote work? 
A majority of my work and volunteer experience has been remote with the exception of a small retail boutique, which I've worked at for over a year, and a summer stint at Culver's. Throughout my experience, I've used a variety of asynchronous communication platforms, including Slack and Discord. I communicate asynchronously as if I was conversing with someone in real-time, reading messages aloud to ensure I'm being personable and authentic. I credit most of my success to the code-switching skills I learned as a child growing up in a traumatic household, primarily appealing to someone's humanity and emotion. That said, I've been able to successfully handle a variety of asynchronous communication, from extremely casual to crucially professional over the years.

What are your personal values?
Dependability: I grew up in an uncertain household, where someone’s mood change was dangerous. I want to be consistently present and loving; I want to be someone people can count on, even if we may disagree or drift in different directions.

Authenticity: I carry myself with infectious radiance, fueled by the people who have raised and mentored me to be proud of myself despite all the challenges. I unabashedly share my learning journeys, from struggling with work-family balance to messing up derivatives.

Compassion: Compassion has become a buzzword in recent years, but to me it’s always meant caring for others as if they were your own chosen family. I aspire to give everyone, including myself, space to make mistakes and grow without shame or fear. I always assume positive intent until proven otherwise, and look for the reasons behind someone’s behavior before pointing fingers.",
