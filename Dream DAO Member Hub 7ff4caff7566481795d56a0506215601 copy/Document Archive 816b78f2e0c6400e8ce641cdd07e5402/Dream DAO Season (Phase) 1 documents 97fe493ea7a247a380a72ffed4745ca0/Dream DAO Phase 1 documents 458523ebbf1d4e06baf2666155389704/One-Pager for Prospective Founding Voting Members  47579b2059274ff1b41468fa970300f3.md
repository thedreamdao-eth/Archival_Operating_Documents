## Overview

The Dream DAO is a new intergenerational, global, and interdisciplinary community that **invests in the future of the web3 x social impact ecosystem, by providing Gen Zers with the training, funding, and community they need to leverage the power of web3 to secure a brighter future for humanity.**

Phase 1 of the Dream DAO kicks off in mid-December 2021. During Phase 1, the founding voting members will decide on foundational design choices about the Dream DAO's voting system, educational programming, and more.

Before Phase 1 kicks off, the founding voting members must be selected by the Civics Unplugged leadership team. There will be ~50 founding voting members: ~25 Champions (established older leaders) and ~25 Builders (motivated 15-20 year olds).

**This document‚Äîwhich complements the "[Dream DAO Community](https://www.notion.so/The-Dream-DAO-Community-4d4475e8905f4d2c95c1504e9b8b17d8?pvs=21)" page in the Dream DAO whitepaper‚Äîoutlines what you need to know to decide if you want to become a founding voting member of the Dream DAO.**

Every single founding voting member is essential to the Dream DAO's success because

- They will set the foundational culture of the Dream DAO
- They will shape foundational decisions related to governance and programming
- They will help select the new members to onboard by Phase 2
- Many of them will be the first leaders of the DAO

## Types of supporters of the Dream DAO for Phase 1

In order to understand what a Dream DAO voting member is, it's important to compare the archetype, role, and benefits of voting members in comparison to other kinds of Dream DAO supporters:

|  | Archetype | Role in DAO's success | Access/benefits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Non-member | Someone who follows Dream DAO on Twitter, but hasn't donated / bought a SkywalkerZ | They might engage with us on social media, and tell their friends about the DAO | Public channels on Discord |
| Non-voting member | ‚Üí 20+ years old
‚Üí Excited about Dream DAO mission enough to buy a SkywalkerZ
‚Üí Doesn't have time to be a voting member / wasn't selected to become a voting member for Phase 1 | They might engage with us on social media, tell their friends about the DAO, make introductions, and so on. But they don't have the responsibility to do so. | ‚Üí SkywalkerZ holder-only (member-only) channels on Discord, but not the voting-member only channels
‚Üí Access to most Dream DAO events
‚Üí Can still weigh in on decisions, they just won't have a vote |
| Voting member
(DreamerZ) | Excited about Dream DAO mission enough to buy a SkywalkerZ and devote 1-2 hours a week to the Dream DAO (either as a Builder or Champion).

## **What will happen in Phase 1**

**During Phase 1, the founding voting members will decide on foundational design choices about the Dream DAO's voting system, educational programming, and more. Leaders will emerge, who will steward various DAO workstreams for Phase 2.**

**Here is a detailed breakdown:**

- Development of the [Dream DAO Explorers Program](https://www.notion.so/Dream-DAO-Programs-Grants-22344032d285469ca317031b7bc4d49f?pvs=21)
- Recruiting of seed funders of the DAO (mostly though relationships cultivated by the CU team, but also through some introductions by founding voting members)
- Lots of learning + building in public
    - First official press writeups and blog posts published about the DAO
- Alpha testing of Merit-Based Voting System
- Recurring DAO design jams + other virtual meetups
    - One example jam topic: how can we use NFTs to fund Explorers program / other learning journeys of Builders?
- Probably a few IRL events for members who can travel to NYC

***And importantly, during Phase 1, members will get helped finding their "You-Shaped Holes" in the DAO ‚ú®**¬†(aka their places in the DAO where their strengths and passions meet the DAOs needs).*

This is VERY important. Everyone has different resources and superpowers. And from our experience building community in Civics Unplugged at large, community members almost always need help finding out how to use them in a way that is beneficial for the community and themselves

### **By the end of Phase 1**

**These things must happen in order to exit Phase 1 and enter Phase 2:**

- $250,000 in the DAO Treasury (currently at ~$125,000)
- First Dream DAO Explorers Selected
- Dream DAO Explorers Program has been built out, ready to launch in Phase 2
- Determine what first Dream DAO Committees / leadership positions should exist
- Determine the relative weight of voting power assigned to people who completed various merit-worthy work
- Core contributors identified, with first Dream DAO Committees assembled via election
- Dream DAO Constitution ratified

### **How contributions will be tracked**

**In order for the CU team and for the Dream DAO community at large to understand who to empower as leaders of the community, major contributions to the DAO will be tracked as part of a merit system.**

Early on in Phase 1, the community will decide what is deemed [merit-worthy work](https://www.notion.so/The-Dream-DAO-Merit-System-d0625913c50d442b83c182ded4c94e24?pvs=21). We will track successful completion of merit-worthy work using some kind of software/system that is not yet chosen. The contributions tracked will help the community decide who to elect to leadership positions in the lead up to Phase 2, and how much each person's vote will be weighed.
