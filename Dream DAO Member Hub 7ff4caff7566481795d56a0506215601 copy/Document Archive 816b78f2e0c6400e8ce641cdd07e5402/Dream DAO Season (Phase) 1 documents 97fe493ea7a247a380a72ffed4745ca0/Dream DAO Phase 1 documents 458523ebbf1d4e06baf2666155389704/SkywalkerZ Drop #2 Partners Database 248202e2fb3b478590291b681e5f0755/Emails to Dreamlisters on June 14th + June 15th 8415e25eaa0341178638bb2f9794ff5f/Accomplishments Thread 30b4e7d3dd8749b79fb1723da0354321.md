we launched Dream DAO Season 1 in January 2022— and we have even surprised ourselves with everything we have accomplished. 

our mission is to empower Gen Z to explore and build the future of regen web3, and in Season 1 we did this by:

- 🤝 onboarded 40 diverse young leaders (15-20 years old) to regen web3—we are majority non-white, majority young women, and are about 50-50 split between US and international members
- 💫 matched 10 of our young members to internships at leading regen web3 orgs (e.g. Celo, Gitcoin, Wonderverse, etc)
- 📚 hosted 29 learning sessions where impact-oriented web3 leaders like @owocki + @tismejanie + @technoshaman to host a discussion on their area of expertise

we are concluding Season 2 with greater conviction in the need to invest in Gen Z to build regen web3 than ever before. our goals include:

- ✈️ sponsor 40 trips for Gen Zers to travel to web3 conferences around the world in places like NYC and Paris
- 🗣️ host another 30 learning sessions with leaders of regen web3
- 💚 onboard dozens more Gen Z leaders into the community and matching 20+ with contributor roles at leading regen web3 orgs
