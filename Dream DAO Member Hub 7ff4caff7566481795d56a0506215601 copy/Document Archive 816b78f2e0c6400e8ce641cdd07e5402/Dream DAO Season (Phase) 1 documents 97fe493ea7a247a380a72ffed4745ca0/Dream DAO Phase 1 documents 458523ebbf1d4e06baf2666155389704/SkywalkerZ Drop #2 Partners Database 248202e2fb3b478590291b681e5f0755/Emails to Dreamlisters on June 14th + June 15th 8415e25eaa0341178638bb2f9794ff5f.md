Hello Dreamlisters,

Today is the day!

You can now mint SkywalkerZ NFTs (up to 10) on our minting site: [https://getskywalkerz.com](https://getskywalkerz.com/)

As a reminder, 100% of the sale of our official membership NFT collection will go directly to furthering our mission of empowering Gen Z to explore and contribute to the impact-oriented side of web3

**Do not post your SkywalkerZ mint until tomorrow because we want it to be a surprise when we announce!**

Tomorrow, after we post our announcement tweet, we we invite you to post a quote tweet or reply to that tweet‚Äîthis is easily the best way for us to get the word out about the collection and our mission.

If you do this and tag 3 people who should mint in your post, we‚Äôll send you a POAP üåû

Love,

Madison
