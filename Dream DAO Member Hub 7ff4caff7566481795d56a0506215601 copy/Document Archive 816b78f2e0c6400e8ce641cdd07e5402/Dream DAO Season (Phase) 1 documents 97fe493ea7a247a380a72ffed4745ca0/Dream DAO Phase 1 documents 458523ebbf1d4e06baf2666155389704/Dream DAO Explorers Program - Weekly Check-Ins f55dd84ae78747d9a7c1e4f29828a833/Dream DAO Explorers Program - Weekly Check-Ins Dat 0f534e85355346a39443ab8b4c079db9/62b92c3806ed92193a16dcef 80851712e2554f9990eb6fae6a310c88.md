Additional comment: I need guidance on how to be useful in ambigous scenarios. Protein, like many other DAOs/early-stage orgs, is somewhat disorganized. I'm not getting tasks with clear acceptance criteria, but instead vague blurbs on what they need. How do I effectively execute with limited info?
Commitment Check: ✅ Finding grants to help out on
✅ Sifting through different grants to find the most applicable.
NO: Having a 1:1 with a Protein member

Name: Ethan Wei
Temperature Check: A bit unsure, but determined to figure it out.
Top Goal 4 Coming Week: 1. Finish a grant application and give to other members for feedback/editing.
2. Find next steps for the Product team projects and contribute.
3. Get feedback on how I'm performing as an intern and where I can be more useful.
Weekly shoutout: Shout out to the homies that went to the Junto for giving me a good sounding board for ideas!
What Else Did You Do?: I did some independent research on the DAO and Protein as a whole, trying to get a sense of what they have done.
What do you need help on?: I need help on understanding what Protein is because I need all the information I can get to formulate a grant draft.

What did you learn?: It's hard to over-communicate, so always err on the side of more communcation.

A bit unsure, but determined to figure it out.
