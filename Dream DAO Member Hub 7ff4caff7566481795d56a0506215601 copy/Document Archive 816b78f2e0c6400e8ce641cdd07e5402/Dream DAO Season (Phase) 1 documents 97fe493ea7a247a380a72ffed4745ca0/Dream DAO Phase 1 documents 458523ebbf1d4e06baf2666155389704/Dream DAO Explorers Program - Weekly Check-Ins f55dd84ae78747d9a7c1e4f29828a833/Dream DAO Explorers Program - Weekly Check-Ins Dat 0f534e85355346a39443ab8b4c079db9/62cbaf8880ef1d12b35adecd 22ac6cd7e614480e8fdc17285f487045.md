Name: Ethan Wei
Temperature Check: I feel energized to continue working. I've found my footing in the DAO, and am looking forward to continuing my contributions as much as possible. 
Top Goal 4 Coming Week: 1. Finish the draft for the B-Corp article with the edits made.
2. Have a deck outline ready for the Protein hackathon sponsors (basically, all the text ready and hand it off to someone else for design). 
3. Find new projects to work on and contribute to.
Weekly shoutout: William Rowe has again been a deciding factor in clarifying things for me.
What Else Did You Do?: I didn't do much besides the tasks I committed to.
What do you need help on?: How to balance autonomy with ambiguity; I feel like I know what I'm doing but sometimes I should be asking for help.
