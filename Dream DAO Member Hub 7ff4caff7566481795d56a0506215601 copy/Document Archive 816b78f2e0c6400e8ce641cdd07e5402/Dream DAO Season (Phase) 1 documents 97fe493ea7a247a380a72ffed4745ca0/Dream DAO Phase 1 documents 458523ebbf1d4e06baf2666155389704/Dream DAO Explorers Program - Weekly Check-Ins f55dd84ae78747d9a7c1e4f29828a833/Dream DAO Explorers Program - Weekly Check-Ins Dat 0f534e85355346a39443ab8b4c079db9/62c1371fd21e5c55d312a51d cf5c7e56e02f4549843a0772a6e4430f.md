Additional comment: Would love to host more Junto and Explorers programs sesh  cause I have seen that not many explorers are turning up to juntos and very less interaction is there on the topic
Commitment Check: ✅learning more about the scouting process
✅referral list update
✅build the koop system
✅ Research more refi projects
Name: Madhav Goyal
Temperature Check: I feel more optimistic than ever!
Top Goal 4 Coming Week: ☑️Tag along with Ollumi to pitch meetings
☑️ do my first unguided write up
☑️publish my learning artifact which is at the intersection of refi and my experience working in it
Weekly shoutout: Ollumi for letting me tag along to meetings!
What Else Did You Do?: working on thinking about more synergies between different regen networks and organizations. I have been noticing how many good people are in this space and how many cool ideas are flowing through which could be turned into something even more meaningful.
What do you need help on?: The Problem I outlined in the last 2 forms seems a bit resolved now cause I have realized that I like refi and researching things more. I am good with data and python which might be useful for becoming a blockchain analyst which is really less right now

What did you learn?: Refi is the best space to be in the world if you want to make a postive impact!

I feel more optimistic than ever!
