Temperature Check: Appreciative
Top Goal 4 Coming Week: 1. Discern what my next steps are for creating a proposal at All for Climate DAO
2. Follow up with Phoebe and define the role that fits me for Solarpunk Foundations
3. Reflect on my own growth areas and strengths that I can bring into my work
Weekly shoutout: Pauline for helping with onboarding and identifying next steps!
What Else Did You Do?: Attended Consensus 2022 from Wednesday to Sunday! I discussed many things solarpunk, had wonderful in-person connections, and learned so much. 
What do you need help on?: I need help from the All for Climate locomotives as I learn how the DAO operates as well as their system for creating proposals and tracking contributions. 
Created time: June 13, 2022 8:52 PM
What did you learn?: I will need to consistently create space for reflecting on my own passions and the ways I feel I can uniquely contribute to my host sites. While I can rely on the support of my host sites, I am responsible for communicating my own needs.
