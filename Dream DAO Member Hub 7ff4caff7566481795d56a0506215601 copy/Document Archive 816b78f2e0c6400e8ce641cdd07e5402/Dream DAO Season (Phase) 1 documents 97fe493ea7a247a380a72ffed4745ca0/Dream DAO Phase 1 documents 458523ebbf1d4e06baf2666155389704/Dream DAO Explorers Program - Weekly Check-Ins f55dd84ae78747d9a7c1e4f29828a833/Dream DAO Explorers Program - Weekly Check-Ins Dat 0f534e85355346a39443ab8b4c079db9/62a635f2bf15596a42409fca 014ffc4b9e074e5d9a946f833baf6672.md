Top Goal 4 Coming Week: 1. Finding at least 2 places to plug into and make recurrent contributions
2. Have at least one 1:1 with a core team member that I just met
3. Set OKRs and KPIs for my time at Protein
4. Get feedback on my work performance and where they need my help most
Weekly shoutout: Saf is the GOAT! We had a good postmortem after the meeting because of my difficulties scheduling synchronous meetings while I'm here in Philly, and he gave me some advice for staying proactive since he has his difficulties as well. 
What Else Did You Do?: I felt like I made a good first impression on the team! We had a good first conversation and I'm excited to work with everyone. 
What do you need help on?: I'm okay for the most part, but I want to get some more clarity on what I can help with and what steps I have left before being fully onboarded.

What did you learn?: Even if you're mostly muted, unmute or turn on camera when you're laughing. It makes the meeting more human.
