What Else Did You Do?: I made my first time sheet and invoice! I also spent a lot of time in 1:1. meetings setting goals for the rest of my internship.
What do you need help on?: I think I need to plan out my time better! I've had a lot going on these past couple of weeks and things have been slipping through, which isn't ideal.
