Top Goal 4 Coming Week: - update spreadsheet with the new ideas

- read more articles 
Weekly shoutout: Nirvaan for all the support!
What Else Did You Do?: I really enjoyed reading the articles to understand more about ReFi and Celo/Climate Collective, as well as figure it out what should have in our Excel spreadsheet that controls the ReFi map.
What do you need help on?: I think I am just struggling a little with understanding the more technical side of ReFi from the articles, I spend a lot of time reading and trying to understand. I will see if I can find resources in different formats like videos.
