Snap for Week Of: August 1, 2022 12:00 AM (UTC)
Additional comment: I'm canoeing/camping until Thursday, so I'll be off-grid until then. I really don't have any capacity these next few weeks, but will be returning to my learning journey towards the end of the month
Commitment Check: ✅ Support RedemptionDAO WGs, Discord, and ops generally

My focus this week was almost all on RedemptionDAO and family commitments. I delayed work on my learning artifact and next steps on the regen human library until I could give them the needed attention.
Name: Oliver Yehlik
Temperature Check: In need of a nap, but hopeful and excited
Top Goal 4 Coming Week: - Go be solarpunk, off-grid in northern Minnesota
Weekly shoutout: Ash Kranti, for the needed encouragement to go touch grass and take a nap
What Else Did You Do?: ✅ Facilitate onboarding strategy call and give insights for RD
✅ Create the Coordinators Hub and work on action items
✅ Recap conversation on Regenerative Community Land Trusts
What do you need help on?: Processing so much new information and input over these last 2 weeks. I'll need to work on connecting with others without pressure to "get to the work."
Created time: August 7, 2022 10:35 PM
What did you learn?: I connected deeply with the concept of withdrawal and "returning to the central conversation." I've gotten a lot of insight into the needs of facilitation in web3, especially as it relates to a human library.
