Commitment Check: - Getting up early to make the most of the day! âœ…
- Have meetings with the Marketing & Comms team and with Ori and Juan to help them in some Admin tasks they proposed to me âœ…
- Do not be afraid to speak because as there are many people I do not find the time to do it (this is more focused on the "All Hands Meeting" and "Swarms Comms Meeting") ðŸ‘€
- Review the builders' profiles in the forum to verify that they have updated their profile âœ…
- Meet more people! âœ…
