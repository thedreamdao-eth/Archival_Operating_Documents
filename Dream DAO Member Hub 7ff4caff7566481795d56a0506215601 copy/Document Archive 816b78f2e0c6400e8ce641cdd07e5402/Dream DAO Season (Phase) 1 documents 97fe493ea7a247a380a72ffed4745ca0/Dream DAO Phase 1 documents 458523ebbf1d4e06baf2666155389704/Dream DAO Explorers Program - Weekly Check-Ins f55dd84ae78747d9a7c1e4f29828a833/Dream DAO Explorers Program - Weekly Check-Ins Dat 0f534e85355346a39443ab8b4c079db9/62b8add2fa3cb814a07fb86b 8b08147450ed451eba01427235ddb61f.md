Commitment Check: Did not do much work this week because of NFT NYC

Name: Timofei Dort-Golts
Temperature Check: Worst in the beginning, but am regaining hope and energy since this weekend
Top Goal 4 Coming Week: Have 2 meetings (Tue, Thu)
Start working on the operations with Joe 
Continue building the strategy
Weekly shoutout: Hmm, I think QZ is an experienced traveler. Mads is also inspiring is she gets to work in different places and see different web3 peeps. That's really cool and I have to find a way to get accustomed to working not only from home ( as it's harder to concentrate sometimes).
What Else Did You Do?: Populated the table some more for the GoblinTown research
What do you need help on?: same two things as in the previous form
Created time: June 26, 2022 4:04 PM
What did you learn?: Not, related to SunGens necessarily, but I really want to change locations more. This is really pleasurable to work from different places.
