### **What Is It:**

- While the ~80 Dream DAO founding voting members are constantly learning web3 x social impact together via our twice-a-week, the Dream DAO Explorers Program is more than just learning what the web3 x social impact space already knows. The Explorers program will support a 10-person cohort of 15-20 year old Dream DAO members as they explore the web3 x social impact ecosystem. They will receive funding to explore, mentorship as they publish an independent study report, and will be placed in a paid three-month summer internship at a growing web3 x social impact organization.
- The Dream DAO Explorers Program is the flagship leadership program of the Dream DAO. The Dream DAO is a new intergenerational, global, and interdisciplinary community that invests in the future of web3 x social impact, by providing Gen Zers with the training, funding, and community they need to leverage the power of web3 to secure a brighter future for humanity.
- The pilot program will be four months, from May - August 2022. Itâ€™s in the summer so that the Explorers can dedicate 25-40 hours a week on their research and internship.
- There will be 10ish explorers - depending on...
    - number of applicants
    - quality of applicants
    - number of internship host sites
    - diversity and inclusion factors
- Only Dream DAO Builders can apply

### Value of the Program to the Web3 x Social Impact

The groundbreaking research and internship experiences of the Explorers will benefit the collective intelligence of the Dream DAO community and the broader web3 x social impact space, and inspire more Gen Zers to contribute to being and building the future of web3 x social impact.

There is a need in web3 for the type of collective knowledge that is going to be gained and documented via the Explorers Program. Web3 x social impact is so nascent and underutilized despite its incredible possibility, and we need as many brilliant and innovative minds as possible tackling its biggest barriers/ using web3 for good. Civic-minded young people are uniquely suited to help answer a lot of these questions because of their bandwidth and desire to leverage tools for the purpose of making the world better.

The Explorers themselves will also push web3 x social impact forward by contributing to growing web3 x social impact projects during their internships.

### Scalability and Roadmap:

- The program will likely happen twice a year. Once in the Summer, and once in the Winter.
- The Winter program will likely cater more to Gap Year students.
- Each program cohort will likely grow as well. If there are 12 Explorers for the pilot program, itâ€™s not unreasonable to assume there could be 20+, if there is enough talent + internship spots to fill.
- The web3 x social impact space is nascent, but itâ€™s growing rapidly and should quickly have more internship spots for more Explorers

### Budget

- $5,000 per Explorer; so $50,000 for 10 Explorers.
