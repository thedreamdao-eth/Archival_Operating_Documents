# SkywalkerZ Drop #2 Partners Database

<aside>
üåÑ We will spend May and early June coordinating with partners for our drop on June 12th - June 18th. At the least, partners should promote SkywalkerZ at the start of the week (12th) and end of the week (18th).

For the promo kit, see [here](../../../Evergreen%20Documents%20976d2984e99f4146b4283457a2303a7c/Evergreen%20Documents%20Database%20db1ccc6322ae474dba4b59d6b687d080/SkywalkerZ%20Strategy%20Hub%20f782c8df3cb44800a4907d056c661a3c.md).

## Before we launch, we need to...

- [ ]  Create POAPs for partners who promote (I would suggest sending them merch too)
- [ ]  Create POAPs for this challenge: ‚ÄúFor everyone who mints a SkywalkerZ, we will encourage them to post their SkywalkerZ and say why they minted, and encourage 3 other people to mint by tagging them on Twitter. Whoever participates in this will receive a POAP.‚Äù
