# Toms for NFTs

Toms became famous for donating a pair of shoes for every shoe sold. A big part of why people bought toms over similar looking brands is the story they bought with the shoe.

What if we reserved one skywalker nft for a kid every time a donor purchased a skywalker. 

A kid grantee of the dream DAO can receive a grant in the form of eth (worth the current floor price of skywalkerz) or get a skywalker itself.

Grantees are chosen by members of the Dream DAO.

This system incentivizes buyers to hold their skywalker and gives them a doubly good philanthropic narrative:

1. Their purchase is essentially a donation to cu (a charity)
2. Their purchase increases the price of the skywalkerz collection — which increases the wealth of skywalker holders - many of whom will be kids

This system also promotes financial education for kids, especially those who have skin in the game via having a skywalker.

Keep in mind that if we do this - it’s almost equivalent to us being able to print grant money out of thin air - giving a kid an nft is not going to lower the value of a buyers nft - especially if donating nfts to kids is baked into the premise of the nft collection in the first place

I’ve been asking around nft veterans and have heard nothing like this done - newspapers love talking about novel stuff - and investors really value novel nft models
