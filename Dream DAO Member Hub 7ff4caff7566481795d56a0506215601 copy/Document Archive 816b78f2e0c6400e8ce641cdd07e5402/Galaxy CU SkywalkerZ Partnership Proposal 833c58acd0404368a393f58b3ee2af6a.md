<aside>
üí° **Mike Novogratz** and **Civics Unplugged** are all invested in supporting those who are building the future. At Civics Unplugged, we have been re-shaping the non-profit paradigm and leveraging new technologies to empower young leaders across the globe. Our branding, missions, and theory of change are extremely aligned. 

Together, we can launch the SkywalkerZ NFT, and create a new way to move massive amounts of funding to world-changing individuals and projects. **We are proposing a partnership with Mike and Galaxy Gives on the launch of the SkywalkerZ NFT and the development of the DreamDAO, which will hold and distribute the funds raised in a democratic fashion.**

## üîç About CU's NFT Launch

---

Civics Unplugged will launch a collection of NFTs, called SkywalkerZ. These NFTs exist to raise massive amounts of funds for our next generation's most promising and talented changemakers and revolutionize philanthropy in the process. 

For the past month, we've been working alongside a designer to create a collection of astronaut-themed NFTs. The first collection will contain 2,030 characters, each with six randomized attributes that are generated upon minting. The 2,030 number was chosen to represent CU's 2030 mission. 

We are planning to sell the NFTs at 0.1 ETH. **Through this sale, we expect to raise a massive philanthropic fund dedicated to investing directly in young changemakers who are leveraging new technology to build a brighter future across the globe.**

Once a user mints an NFT, they will also have governance tokens dropped into their wallet. These governance tokens will allow them to participate in the Dream DAO, where the fund will be held and distributed.

Each quarter (or more frequently), the Civics Unplugged Gen Z Community will do the hard work of reviewing hundreds of their peers' project applications, and send those with the highest potential to the DAO. Token holders will then have the opportunity to vote, and allocate funds to these projects.

This Philanthropic Model:

- Allows the donor community to have a direct influence on where their funds are allocated.
- Creates a new precedent for how the crypto community invests in social change.
- Changes the lives of some of the most promising kids around the world.
    - We are investing in people first. These young leaders have the potential to change the world.
- Creates a new paradigm for how to turn communities of practice into movements.
