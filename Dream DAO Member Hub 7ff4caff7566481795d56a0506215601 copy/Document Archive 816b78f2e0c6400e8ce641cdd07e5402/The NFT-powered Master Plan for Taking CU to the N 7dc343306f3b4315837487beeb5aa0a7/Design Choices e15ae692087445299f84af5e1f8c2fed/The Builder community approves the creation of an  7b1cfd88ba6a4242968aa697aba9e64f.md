# The Builder community approves the creation of an NFT Superhero Journey for sale

Notes: The Builder community will establish and carry out a process of approving which NFT Superhero Journey's get created for auction to Champions.

This ensures that the Builder community is incentivized to help Journey creators craft compelling journeys and also ensures that Builders feel like the process of who was picked was fair (no nepotism).

This also will increase Builder engagement because it helps them feel like they are a key part of Civics 2030, the movement-building video game.
