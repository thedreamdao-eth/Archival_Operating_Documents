# CU crafts a big welcome event for Champions after the public NFT sale

Notes: CU was already planning on doing a fundraiser (which got pushed back) - this could be the greatest use of an event budgetâ€”invite Champions to meet each other and get excited about the future.

It should be extremely exciting for this founding group of champions to meet each other and be like "WOW. CU really has good taste in who they bring into their movement building operation. I want to invest in this movement so I get a lot of new connections / social clout / etc in return."

(Small design choice for the event - to get entry into it you have to use your Ethereum wallet to prove you have the NFT)
Achieves what objectives: #1: Build a community of Champions committed to investing in Builders (../Design%20Objectives%207df326d2b4e64a7c919c23f26e93dc55/#1%20Build%20a%20community%20of%20Champions%20committed%20to%20inv%20b11b2f142f704ec588b3bc67f8c4ccdf.md)
