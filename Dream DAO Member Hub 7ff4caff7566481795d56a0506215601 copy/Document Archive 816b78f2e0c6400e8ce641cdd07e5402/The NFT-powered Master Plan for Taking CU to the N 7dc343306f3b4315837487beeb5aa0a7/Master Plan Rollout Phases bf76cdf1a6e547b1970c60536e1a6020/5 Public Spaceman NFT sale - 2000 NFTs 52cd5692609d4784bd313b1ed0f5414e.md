# 5. Public Spaceman NFT sale - 2000 NFTs

Notes: We should probably use the industry standard NFT minting process where people find instructions about how to mint 1 or more (maybe up to 5 or 10) random NFTs of a collection, and go to a website at a given time. It builds a lot of hype.

We don't necessarily need to feel bad about not selling all of them at once.
