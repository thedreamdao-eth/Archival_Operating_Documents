Host a celebratory event for early members of the DAO,"Think: Core Club Part 2

During our first Core Club meeting in 2019, the CU founding team brought together dozens of people who might be interested in supporting the founding chapter of CU.

2+ years later, we are ready to launch CU's next chapter, this time with a community of funder-type people.

Imagine NFT holders each inviting 1-5 friends who might be interested in joining the funder's collaborative.

Imagine us leaving the event with 50 new Champions.

We already wanted to do an event with Alexis. This could be a great use of our event budget."
"Kick off process of getting kids to design their ""Civic Super[Hero's Journey""","We will want to create a Civic Gym series (or recurring workshop) that helps kids design their Civics 2030 Plans to level up as leaders and accelerate human flourishing.

Don't know if all this will be ready by the end of the Fall '21 Fellowship, but we can bake this in directly to the Spring '22 Fellowship."
"Kick off the Recurring NFT Civic Superhero Journey ""Drops""","Basically, we want Champions to compete (in a friendly way) over who has bragging rights about seeding some young civic superhero's future. "
Who knows??,"If all this goes well, we could do so many things with this community/movement.

Things like a Netflix show become truly possible with the sufficient amount of hype around the movement + actual young superheroes being created in real time.

If the Civics 2030 DAO really develops a big endowment, we could even create a Launch Year program.

A couple years from now, we could actually be giving 5-6 figure grants to youth led orgs that actually didn't crash and burn too. As the community matures, it makes sense to keep funding the same people who continually prove themselves. "
