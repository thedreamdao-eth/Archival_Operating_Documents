# Who knows??

Notes: If all this goes well, we could do so many things with this community/movement.

Things like a Netflix show become truly possible with the sufficient amount of hype around the movement + actual young superheroes being created in real time.

If the Civics 2030 DAO really develops a big endowment, we could even create a Launch Year program.

A couple years from now, we could actually be giving 5-6 figure grants to youth led orgs that actually didn't crash and burn too. As the community matures, it makes sense to keep funding the same people who continually prove themselves.
