# Host a celebratory event for early members of the DAO

Notes: Think: Core Club Part 2

During our first Core Club meeting in 2019, the CU founding team brought together dozens of people who might be interested in supporting the founding chapter of CU.

2+ years later, we are ready to launch CU's next chapter, this time with a community of funder-type people.

Imagine NFT holders each inviting 1-5 friends who might be interested in joining the funder's collaborative.

Imagine us leaving the event with 50 new Champions.

We already wanted to do an event with Alexis. This could be a great use of our event budget.
