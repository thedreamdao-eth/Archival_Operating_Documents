# Kick off process of getting kids to design their "Civic Super[Hero's Journey"

Notes: We will want to create a Civic Gym series (or recurring workshop) that helps kids design their Civics 2030 Plans to level up as leaders and accelerate human flourishing.

Don't know if all this will be ready by the end of the Fall '21 Fellowship, but we can bake this in directly to the Spring '22 Fellowship.
