# Fellowship engagement during the program needs a lot of work

How Master Plan Fixes This: Kids are not motivated to do their Leadership Blueprint and complete their pledge (because they don't see how it connects to achieving their goals).

This master plan would change that.

If we move forward with this plan, we will want to really emphasize to Fellows during the Fellowship the benefits of taking their plan-development + personal narrative crafting seriously.
