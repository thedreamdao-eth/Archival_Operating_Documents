Question,Working answer
Why do we want to hand curate and recruit the first Spaceman NFT holders?,To give Civics 2030 / the NFT collection a strong sense of credibility in the eyes of people who are not familiar with CU.
Spaceman customization for Champions?,"Is it purely random what NFT a champion gets? Or do we customize for the champion?

Gary:
→ I think the public NFT sale should yield random Spacemen, but I don't know if the first Champions should get random ones. The first ones need to look really dope for people to be like ""damn what is that picture? let me ask this person why they made it their profile pic"""
Why can't other orgs implement this strategy as effectively as CU?,"CU has many competitive advantages:
→ Blockchain/Crypto expert network / in-house fluency in the space
→ Talent of team to do many things (storytelling, 1:1 convincing people to join things, ability to execute complex projects in a timely fashion)
→ Brand of CU (Space, youthful, forward thinking)"
Is this pitched as an NFT sale?,"To the first donors that are already connected to CU, it's not pitched this way:
→ We aren’t selling NFTs, we are forging a community of Champions whose membership is verified via NFT (and whose purchase price is the cost of the community membership).

But to the people buying from hearing about us through hype media, this can be more directly pitched as an NFT asset whose value will grow over time (and opportunity to be part of a dope community)"
Is this just pitched to Crypto People?,"No. We are building a community of Champions, some of whom may be unfamiliar or even resistant to crypto.

For those that are, we can help them set up an Ethereum wallet and allow them to wire us the membership cost through traditional means.

That said, we expect that implementing NFTs and a DAO into our movement building strategy will attract many crypto-enthusiasts."
How do we hype the crypto community about funding youth led projects?,"For some people, they will love the fact that they can relieve their tax burden by donating to CU (via joining as a Champion).

For others, they will love the fact that we are a blockchain-forward nonprofit doing really cool stuff. Very unique."
"How much do we use ""DAO"" language (versus ""community"" language without the jargon)?","Depends on the audience.

For crypto enthusiasts, we definitely want to lean in on the DAO language.

For many people, it may turn them off and confuse them."
Is there a limit to how many Spaceman NFTs someone can buy?,"Yes.

Maybe 10?

It doesn't seem right that people with a bunch of money can take up all the Champion slots."
What are the tax implications for someone who sells their Spaceman?,"Especially if they declared their initial purchase as a charitable donation.

→ Is the initial purchase a donation, and the resale a taxable event?

Also, what happens if someone sells their Spaceman? Are they still able to be a part of the community? "
What is the price of an NFT?,".1 ETH to get foot in the door with big donors, who can get sucked into the CUniverse and fall in love and eventually donate a lot more over time"
How do we reach out to Crypto Whales?,
Who can we partner with?,"UniSwap?
Giving Block?
EnDAOment?"
