# Is this pitched as an NFT sale?

Working answer: To the first donors that are already connected to CU, it's not pitched this way:
→ We aren’t selling NFTs, we are forging a community of Champions whose membership is verified via NFT (and whose purchase price is the cost of the community membership).

But to the people buying from hearing about us through hype media, this can be more directly pitched as an NFT asset whose value will grow over time (and opportunity to be part of a dope community)
