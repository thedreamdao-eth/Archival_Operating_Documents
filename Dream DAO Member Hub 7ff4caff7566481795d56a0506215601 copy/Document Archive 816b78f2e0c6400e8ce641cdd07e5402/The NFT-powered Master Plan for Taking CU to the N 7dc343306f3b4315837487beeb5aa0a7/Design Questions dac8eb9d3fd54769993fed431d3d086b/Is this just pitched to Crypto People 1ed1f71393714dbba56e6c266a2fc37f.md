Working answer: No. We are building a community of Champions, some of whom may be unfamiliar or even resistant to crypto.

For those that are, we can help them set up an Ethereum wallet and allow them to wire us the membership cost through traditional means.

That said, we expect that implementing NFTs and a DAO into our movement building strategy will attract many crypto-enthusiasts.
