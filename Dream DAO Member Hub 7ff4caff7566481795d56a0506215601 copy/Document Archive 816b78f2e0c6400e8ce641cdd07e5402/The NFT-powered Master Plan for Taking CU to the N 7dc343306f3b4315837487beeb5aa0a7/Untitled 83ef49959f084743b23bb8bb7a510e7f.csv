Shortcoming,How Master Plan Fixes This
Fellowship admissions strategy has stagnated (hard to recruit kids),Kids want to be part of something COOL and LUCRATIVE (and supercharging of their futures). This master plan makes being part of the CU fellowship 10x more directly tied to all of this.
Fellowship engagement during the program needs a lot of work,"Kids are not motivated to do their Leadership Blueprint and complete their pledge (because they don't see how it connects to achieving their goals).

This master plan would change that.

If we move forward with this plan, we will want to really emphasize to Fellows during the Fellowship the benefits of taking their plan-development + personal narrative crafting seriously."
Builder engagement is LOW (and people don't take the pledge + Leadership Blueprint seriously),"Builders are right now not hugely incentivized to contribute regularly to each other's flourishing.

If in order for you to get a chance to get funding from the members of the Civics 2030 DAO, you need it to be approved by Fellow builder, you will show up to more events and contribute more to the community."
Fundraising for CU is not getting much easier over time,"Right now, our strategy for raising funds is building 1:1 relationships with donors. We have yet to create a community (or movement) of donor-types that are fighting over who can signal more about their contributions to CU."
CU does not get much media attention,This would TOTALLY change that.
CU not being that differentiated from other youth empowerment orgs,This would TOTALLY change that.
CU is seen as rising way above the banality of day to day politics / civics,"When we are associated with stuff like crypto instantly less political looking.
And people would associate us with the FUTURE- not just a party (think like elon musk)."
