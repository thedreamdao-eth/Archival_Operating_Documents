Phase,Notes,By when?
1. Design all the Spaceman NFTs + Mapping Out the Narrative (and finalizing this whole Master Plan Rollout),"Graphic design needs to be on point. Needs to be top notch across all profile picture NFT collections being sold.

Will be a decent amount of trial and error and rounds of feedback by Team + Builders. 

- - -

Narrative has to be KILLER.","September 10, 2021"
1.5. Intro this idea to Builder community,The Steering Committee and beyond would like to be informed on major strategic decisions related to CU's future.,"September 17, 2021"
2. Create the Smartcontracts / Systems to Sell NFTs in The Optimal Way,"Gary is getting familiar with this whole world, but it will be good to get an expert to consult with us.","September 17, 2021"
3. Recruit FOUNDING MEMBERS of the Civics 2030 DAO,"We want to get really high profile people onboard. I think we want to get a 30 luminaries + philanthropists on board before we open up the funder's collaborative to more people.

30 is a special number because of 2030.

It will feel really special to be part of this tiny group.","October 1, 2021"
"4. ""Cats out of the bag"" media blitz","We will work with media connects we have to publish insanely hype building writeups about the funder's collaborative being built around Civics 2030.

The article will link to instructions on how to mint a Spaceman NFT (and join this movement). 

After hearing that Jacqueline and Mike Novogratz, Andrey Yang, and dozens more impressive people are onboard with our vision and part of the collaborative, so many status seeking people will sign up for the waitlist.","October 15, 2021"
5. Public Spaceman NFT sale - 2000 NFTs,"We should probably use the industry standard NFT minting process where people find instructions about how to mint 1 or more (maybe up to 5 or 10) random NFTs of a collection, and go to a website at a given time. It builds a lot of hype.

We don't necessarily need to feel bad about not selling all of them at once.","November 1, 2021"
