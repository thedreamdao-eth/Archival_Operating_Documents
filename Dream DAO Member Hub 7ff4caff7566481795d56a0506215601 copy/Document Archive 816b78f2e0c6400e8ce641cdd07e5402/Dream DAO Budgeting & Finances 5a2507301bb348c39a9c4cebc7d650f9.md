## Monthly Accounting Instructions

- Keep a **running tally** of any multisig expenses and traditional expenses using a simple spreadsheet
    
    ![Untitled](Dream%20DAO%20Budgeting%20&%20Finances%205a2507301bb348c39a9c4cebc7d650f9/Untitled.png)
    
- Pull transactions from the **multisig wallets** at the beginning of each month
    1. This should take about 15 minutes, a few days into the start of the new month
    2. Go to the DAOâ€™s [multisig accounts](Dream%20DAO%20Budgeting%20&%20Finances%205a2507301bb348c39a9c4cebc7d650f9.md) on Zerion and **download the CSV files** showing the transaction history
        
        ![Screen Shot 2022-09-09 at 6.22.56 AM.png](Dream%20DAO%20Budgeting%20&%20Finances%205a2507301bb348c39a9c4cebc7d650f9/Screen_Shot_2022-09-09_at_6.22.56_AM.png)
        
    3. Open the first CSV file on your computer and **copy all of the cells** below the header row
        
        ![Untitled](Dream%20DAO%20Budgeting%20&%20Finances%205a2507301bb348c39a9c4cebc7d650f9/Untitled%201.png)
        
    4. Go to the Dream DAO budget spreadsheet (go to the appropriate `_multsig` or `_skywalkerz` tab) and **paste special the new values** in below the header row
        
        ![Untitled](Dream%20DAO%20Budgeting%20&%20Finances%205a2507301bb348c39a9c4cebc7d650f9/Untitled%202.png)
        
    5. The **spreadsheet should update** to reflect the latest transactions. Confirm that everything looks OK and the data still makes sense under the header columns.
        
        ![Untitled](Dream%20DAO%20Budgeting%20&%20Finances%205a2507301bb348c39a9c4cebc7d650f9/Untitled%203.png)
        
    6. **Repeat the same steps** for the other multisig.
    7. Go to the spreadsheet tab called `ONCHAIN` and **confirm the new monthâ€™s data** is showing up correctly
        
        ![Untitled](Dream%20DAO%20Budgeting%20&%20Finances%205a2507301bb348c39a9c4cebc7d650f9/Untitled%204.png)
        
    8. If you run into any issues, confirm that you downloaded the CSV from Zerion with the base currency selected as USD. Also check that the spreadsheetâ€™s `named ranges` are still correct.
    
- Reconcile **actual vs budgeted** expenses
    1. Once the multisig is updated, go to the `BUDGET` spreadsheet and scroll over to the month that just ended
        
        ![Untitled](Dream%20DAO%20Budgeting%20&%20Finances%205a2507301bb348c39a9c4cebc7d650f9/Untitled%205.png)
        
    2. Conduct a **review of all expenses** by looking at the payouts spreadsheet and/or Zerion history and typing in the appropriate values
        1. Note that Paypal / Justworks expenses will show up here 0xCB4B447977ed888b140C9a2F5CdFf3f862fFDf07
        2. Confirm with the Coordination Wizard that expenses are categorized correctly
