## The Overview

---

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Civics Unplugged, and our partners, are committed to empowering those who will build the future. In the coming weeks, we will launch a philanthropic DAO that will give members the power to allocate funding to young leaders around the world without bureaucratic.

</aside>

On October 11th, 2021, [Civics Unplugged](http://www.civicsunplugged.org) will release a set of 2,030 unique astronaut NFTs, priced at 0.1 ETH per NFT. **Through this sale, we expect to raise a massive philanthropic fund dedicated to investing directly in young changemakers who are leveraging blockchain technology to build a brighter future across the globe.**

The Fund will be managed by the soon-to-be-established Dream DAO, which SkywalkerZ NFT holders help govern. Every NFT holder interested in joining the DAO can vote on the distribution of Dream DAO funds, and invest in a group of young people to pursue their aspirations to change the world.

Civics Unplugged is a 501(c)(3) social enterprise whose mission is to empower the leaders of Gen Z to build a brighter future for humanity. CU partners with and is backed by National Geographic, The Smithsonian, Andrew Yang, Mike Novogratz, Audrey Tang, and more.

Minting will take place at [getskywalkerz.com](http://getskywalkerz.com).

If you're reading this document, it's because we want to invite you to invest in one or more SkywalkerZ, join our Dream DAO as a founding member, and spark a wave of support for our launch on October 11th.

Depending on your bandwidth, we'd also love to jam with you on how we grow this movement to sustain for years to come.

### Why We Exist

---

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ We are revolutionizing the way humanity invests in changemakers, initiatives, and its collective future. If successful, we will have enabled thousands of extraordinarily talented young people to devote their full attention to building public goods that will level up all sectors of society.

</aside>

If the past few years have shown us anything, it's that the breakdown of societal systems in one place impedes the potential for humans to flourish everywhere. To reverse our downward spiral, we must invest in young leaders who are eager to collaborate to support the flourishing of their communities and the world around them.

While many different interventions are needed to reverse the downward spiral, we at Civics Unplugged are confident that investing directly into youth around the world is essential to how we as a global community can radically increase the health and resilience of our collective future.

These youth have the creativity, energy, and passion to build a brighter future. In today's age, they can leverage collective intelligence, access resources, and make waves using just a mobile phone.

**They only have one major roadblock â€” funding.** 

Since we've launched Civics Unplugged, we've seen foundations struggle with long timelines, unclear funding priorities, centralized decision making structures, and niche KPIs. Their funding methods were not aligned with our new approach to human development at Civics Unplugged. 

That's why we decided to pool our own capital and invest directly in youth led projects within Civics Unplugged. **Over the past year, we've moved over $100,000 directly to Gen Z and impacted over hundreds of thousands of people. This strategy has put us on the path to be the largest youth-empowerment movement on the planet.** 

Instead of taking this success back to the Foundations, we are doubling down on our approach, and launching a new way to continue to fund the future. What we are building will allow a new community of funders to invest directly in young people using decentralized technology for good. It is a new, liberating philanthropic system that mirrors the values and principles of the space it is fueled by.

***It will give young people the freedom to build the future of their dreams by removing the financial barriers associated with pursuing world-changing ideas.***
