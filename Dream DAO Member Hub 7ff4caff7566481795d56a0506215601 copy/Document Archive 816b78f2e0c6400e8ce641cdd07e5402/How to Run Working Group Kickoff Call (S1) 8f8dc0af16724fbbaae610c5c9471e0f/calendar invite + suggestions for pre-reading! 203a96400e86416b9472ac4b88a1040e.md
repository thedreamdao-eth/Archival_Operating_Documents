# calendar invite + suggestions for pre-reading!

Calendar Invite Tips: 

**Tips: Do NOT put the name of your meeting, tap save, then re click it and tap the pencil to edit it, it will confuse you and mishaps will happen (This is the reason why I sent mine wrong incorrectly the first time)** 

‚Üí insert your WG name + meeting #

‚Üí set it in event

‚Üí set the time (based on your time zone/location!) ‚Üí it will automatically convert time zones to those living elsewhere!

‚Üí put the working group member‚Äôs emails in the ‚Äúadd guests section‚Äù ‚Üí this will allow the emails to be sent in the correct mode
