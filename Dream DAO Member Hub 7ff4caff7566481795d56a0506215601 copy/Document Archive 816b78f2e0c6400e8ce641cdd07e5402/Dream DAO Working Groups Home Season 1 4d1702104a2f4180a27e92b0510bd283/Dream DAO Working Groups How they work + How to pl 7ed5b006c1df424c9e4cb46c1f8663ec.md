# Dream DAO Working Groups: How they work + How to plug in

<aside>
üåû Based on Phase 1 Plug-In surveys, Dream DAO Founding Voting Members (DreamerZ) have been assigned working groups.

What are working groups? How do they work? And how can DreamerZ effectively contribute to them? This document explains.

**(all of this is subject to change)**

## What Are Working Groups

Working Groups are the small group collectives of DreamerZ that are focused on particular workstream that is related to achieving our collective Dream DAO mission.

The CU Team sorted people into working groups based on their interests and bandwidth (as indicated by the Plug In Survey).

DreamerZ can serve on multiple working groups, but don‚Äôt serve on more than 2 if you only have a couple hours a week you can dedicate to Dream DAO.

You can change your working group if you changed your mind about where you want to plug into.

You can see the Working Groups and who is assigned to each group [here](../Dream%20DAO%20Working%20Groups%20Home%20Season%201%204d1702104a2f4180a27e92b0510bd283.md).

Working Groups will eventually be led by Leads - which will be elected mid Phase 1. 

## How We Will Get Things Done

- **Gary** proposes Phase 1 key results for each group
    - He will then share it with each working group, and people can propose changes to it.
- People volunteer to be the one **interim coordinator** for their working group
    - This is just the person who will schedule the initial brainstorm + take notes + other admin stuff - everyone will be empowered to contribute ideas and execute on tasks
- Each Working Group, with a lot of input from **Gary**, identifies:
    1. The key results for the working group for Phase 1
    2. What ought to be done (at least initially) to achieve these results
- There will be a working group open task board that where people can pick which tasks they want to take lead on or support. The table will have tasks/descriptions and people put their name by which ones they want. As people work on the task, they will update the status from ‚Äúnot started‚Äù to ‚Äúin progress‚Äù, and eventually ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù. This is good for tracking and assigning tasks, and makes it easy to add them to the contribution log.
    - The results of each Working Group jam will be uploaded to this task board
- **Madison** will check in at least 2 times a week in each working group to make sure things are moving forward and people who are stuck on their task get help
- **Madison** will transfer tasks completed to the [Dream DAO Contributions Log](../Dream%20DAO%20Contributions%20Log%2079aa8266fcc44da3bb60c648c01cd522.md) after
- Once we‚Äôve seen who has the bandwidth and capability to perform working group-related tasks, we will be ready to elect Working Group Leads (**not just coordinators**)
    - Interim coordinators is almost entirely an administrative role, while Group Leads are both administrative and startegic: they will be expected to ideate on tasks, manage the working group, and support other group memebrs in their advancemnet in the DAO.
