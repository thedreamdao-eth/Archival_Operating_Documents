Design choice/question,Tentative thoughts as a group (led by Gary),Asynchronous Thoughts/Ideas
What do Juntos do / role of Junto?,"→ Helping Explorers with goal setting

→ Juntos will be groups of 7 if there are 15 people, led by a Champion","Madison: Would be cool for them to do hackathons and/or have convos about their independent learning 

Ale: role of belonging, community, sense making and knowing everyone else is also figuring it out"
Gamification,"→ Can Juntos be competitive in some friendly way?
    → Yes. Let’s figure out what metrics we want to track.

→ What metrics do we track?
    → Number of learning together sessions held
    → Learning Together attendee total
    → what else?","Ethan: We can also consider doing something around milestones/points? For example, publishing x articles or completing x task could unlock more opportunities.

Madison: Hackathons would be great "
Relationship + responsibilities of Explorers to rest of DAO / web3,"→ Share their research in consumable ways

→ Host recurring meetings that the rest of the DAO can come to that enable other members to hear what explorers are learning?
      → i think we should start weekly Open Jam Session - Explorers can plug into these and share some insights

→ How do non-Explorer builders relate to Explorers during the Explorers program?
      → Explorers could host Learning Together sessions?


→ How do Explorer program alumni’s roles change after they graduate?
    I think it’s a good question to ask what happens when Builders get too old PERIOD. And is the Builder role a temporary role? Do some people roll off if they are inactive? Do some people become Champions?

→ How do alumni support the next program?
     → They will give detailed feedback on what to improve
     → Some will be Explorers Program Junto Guides
     → They will share their learnings with others.","Madison: Re: Builder role status, maybe we should do it like doctors have to do, like some action at a certain frequency to renew your license or in this case membership. Also for the role alumni play, I wonder if they should be the primary ones running the program (with the help of the rest of the DAO)
Ale: I like the idea of running the program, having a very active role on iterating and growing the topics and experiences. Although I wonder how will they be ‘rewarded’ and if we do really need like 20 people to run a program. Also they could be guides, providing workshops, meet some cool explorers. What differentiates a builder from a Champion, when do Builders become champions if commitment and value shows they should transition. "
How mentors fit in,"→ 1:1 mentorship

→ We’d probably open up mentorship applications to beyond our Champion community?
    → Depends on what the role of the mentor is

→ should the mentor be someone related to the internship host site?

→ is there multiple mentors?","Madison: I think people should be able to reach out to their dream mentor. Also, should prob meet weekly if the program is 3 months since so much will be going on. Otherwise, bi-weekly would be good +1 Madhav

I like the idea of mentors within DreamDAO and also making sure the Explorer has a point person in the internship that they can reach out to in a mentor capacity to guide the experience as one that is fulfilling. Champion mentorship remains throughout the program. Ale"
Nature of the internships,"→ in summer - 2.5 months?

→ explorer gets to “own” a tangible set of key results that they spend the summer driving to achieving
→ web3 x social impact related (need to flesh out criteria)
→ Does this have to do with the independent research question?
   Ideally","Madison: Need to make sure the internships are meaningful  + Ale - aligned with their goals and interests, ideally they own a specific project, product, feature or research of the organization
Madhav: How do we incentivize the explorers to feel more engaged and appreciated ?—Ale: the mentor ensures this + a bi-weekly call with 4-5 explorers and a DreamDAO member to share experiences, questions, etc about internship"
Relationship of independent learning to internship?,"Ideally it’s related. Ideally the internship experience helps answer the research question.

Maybe the research can help explorers land the internship","Madison: Yep, I think its both. Explorers can show the internship site what they have learned so far and explain why the internship will help them learn more +1 Ale. "
How do other DAOs fit into this?,"Maybe Explorers need to do 1 or more bounties in other DAOs
→ I think so","Madison: We need to make sure this actually adds a lot of value- I don’t see a clear reason to involve other DAOs right now "
Stipend size + distribution schedule,"→ How do the internship host sites help fund the Explorers program?
    → Donating to the Dream DAO?

→ Who else is funding the Explorers program?

→ The stipend must be good enough to justify working nearly full time during summer

- - - 

Laws around crypto payment (and other payment) should be looked into","Ethan: Personally, I think stipend is more of a luxury than a necessity. I would wait off until after we get the initial cohort and have a sense of the budget before setting a size. 

Madison: I think it needs to be at least 1k to make the program accessible for people who would otherwise need to be working during the summer for personal financial reasons. If that is not possible, maybe it is need-based? Like people request funding? 

Ale: Definitely agree on stipend, even with passion it is often that students specially those on financial aid  do need the stipend. I wonder though if this can be covered by partner org in some extend or we can do some maths around the cost of the course vs stipend for internship, maybe there is a solution by playing around these?
Madhav : Stipends I think would be a good way to show appreciation that people do care that they are doing something good. Appreciation means a lot ."
Length + intensity of program,"initially thought 6 months might be good, but might be too long especially since we need more time to plan the program AND we are already doing a lot of foundational learning through basic DAO operations

So maybe it’s more like 3.5 months (internship included)?
→ Beginning of May to mid August?
→ what happens before internship?
→ 2-2.5 month internship?

First phase of internship in may might be less time (7-10 hrs a week), but during internship it’s like full time work.","Thoughts change - 6 months could show the rigour and the possibilities of the program - Madhav

Ethan: It would be good to either have a longer program or two short ones. For example, exploring for 3 months and then building something for another 3 could be a good method.

Madison: I like the idea of 3.5 months because you are completely immersed in it. I think this will allow people to get so much more out of the program because they won’t have to juggle school/extracurriculars. That said, I also think that the internship needs to come after they have learned  some. Maybe the first half of program is learning, and second half of program is internship to apply that learning.  
Ale: I like the idea of a shorter program, so people are fully focused and committed. How about learning - internship (still has sessions with DreamDAO in some way)-building. I was thinking about learning starting on the last month or 2 of the school year but would this be hard with finals?"
Relationship to rest of DAO learning,"Way more hands on learning (project building)

More independent learning: maybe each Explorer needs to do a DEEP dive on a question that the web3 world should have insight into.
→ a default question could be: what is one problem not being solved in social impact world; and how could web3 support it? (and questions like this)

→ Build weekends?
    → this is a great idea!

→ Small Juntos
","Maybe the explorers could host a session based on the insight they had or a project they are building - Madhav +1 -Madison
Ale: This space is so early there is still so much opportunity for explorers to learn and create valuable content just like Kernel guild tracks evolve and grow over time"
How can we educate parents?,They may be confused about web3,"Ethan: Send the Dream DAO one-pager and maybe host a parent info session if there’s enough demand? We can also create an “Intro to Web3” resource or direct them to existing ones from OdysseyDAO or CCS. +1 -Madison +1 Ale definitely parent info session where parents can see the actual faces of us, champions, etc instead of NFT representations they would not understand. "
How many explorers?,10-15 - need to keep it small so we get it right (and know what to refine + automate in future),"I think 10 would be a good number because it could help them form strong bonds as Dunbar's number comes into play  - Madhav

Ethan: I think this comes with interest as well. We have a lot of builders, and if the builders are all dedicated + have the bandwidth, I see no reason to reject them. +1 -Madison +1 Ale I think even 20-25 builders could make a super-strong cohort"
How does the Leadership Blueprint / personal development fit in?,"Will help people figure out their You-Shaped hole in web3

Some inspiration: https://www.notion.so/9fdefed3197d4044972c64d4698210fc?pvs=21","Leadership Blueprint if done with enough rigour could really help a person grow and know their strengths and passions. - Madhav +1 -Madison

Will help them throughout their career beyond web3 learning, help set goals, find where their talents lie, skills to develop and even what kind of role they want to have within projects so they can thrive on this. Similar to Kernel, it is an internal as much as external exploration of knowledge. "
Selection Process / criteria,"All Dream DAO builders?
→ I think so

Who is selecting? 
→ Rank choice voting, with people with most merit points listed first

How does the merit system play into this?
→ See above

Is there voting?
→ See above

Are we factoring in DEI in this?
→ I think so. Need people from multiple continents. Definitely US representation. Definitely BIPOC representation. ","Are the first ones chosen by Cu people or the DAO Memebers as we are working on seting up avoting system - Madhav

Madison: People should also be able to answer a set of questions that let them demonstrate their interest/commitment to more or less campaign for the spot (but there should be restrictions around this). Another question is how will we do voting if we don’t want a specific cap/we want everyone interested to be a part of it? 

Agree on application to show interest and commitment, If builders can be explorers, are builders also voting? Ale"
What is the capstone/exit criteria? (Ethan),"→ How can we make sure that the explorers are learning?

→ Should there be requirements surrounding explorers to prove their learning?
","Bi-weekly near to maybe 700 words reflection post might be a good way we could encourage them to learn in public? - Madhav

Madison: I think they should be able to create a capstone that answers the question they entered the program with. It could also be cool to let them pick what type of capstone (research paper, video, presentation, etc)  +2 Ale,Madhav"
