- Maybe first outline the problems and show how blockchain could solve them. it's probably the best way to make one interested into the opportunities web3 has to offer.
    - Why do people cook books and lead to losses of the normal people?
    - How can we solve the trust issue with the banks?
    - The possibilities of an immutable ledger that can't be hacked or changed?
- Begin discussing the framework for a website (probably a notion website or webflow)?
- Sync the creation of this website with the first running of the Explorer’s program — as a collective Explorer’s program.
- Create a step-by-step 6-8 week study plan that people can follow
    - and to organize our resources in a cumulative manner
- Integrate successful social impact case studies that Ale is working on!
