# What you need to do-

1. Three Tasks have been created in the task list [here](../../../Working%20Group%20Tasks%2076ca256d9d004fff83323d621d18337e.md)
2. Kindly input your work in **the page of the same task**, that is, just hover on the cell and click on ‘open’
3. A thread **in the Community Building Channel has been created** for jamming in asynch ofc!

also a SHOUTOUT TO SAF, JAE HEE, ASH, KARL for these ideas!

## The Ideas

### 1️⃣[Having Office Hours in the Dream DAO weekly](../../../Working%20Group%20Tasks%2076ca256d9d004fff83323d621d18337e/Chalk%20out%20the%20plan%20to%20Have%20Office%20Hours%20in%20the%20Dre%20906efa75af40468bbd383c0a09e9a6b1.md)

(I leave it to you to define office hours, it is basically sessions for answering questions for the DAO by the public in general :))))

**MORE OF A FORMAL ACTIVITY, not necessarily fun, should go under community building not fun events

### 2️⃣[Homework together for the Builders](../../../Working%20Group%20Tasks%2076ca256d9d004fff83323d621d18337e/Chalk%20out%20the%20plan%20for%20Homework%20Together%20for%20the%20B%20f2248319e4c84e96931497ee8ad5b4ff.md)/[DreamerZ work-togethers](../../../Working%20Group%20Tasks%2076ca256d9d004fff83323d621d18337e/DreamerZ%20Work%20togethers%209a92dc4135ea48acad14b152c4159fed.md)

**Do a show and tell after a few minutes showing what you’ve done

**again, it’s not necessarily fun but it is productive 

**not very many ppl show up to these —> can’t rly be changed based on DAO activity but this can still be open for the opportunity as it is more focused on productivity

**Again, this is too related to the DAO and isn’t nessesarily fun, ppl would most likely skip, better to prioritize unrelated, more fun events

### 3️⃣ Talent Show

(a place to know each other’s talents - performing arts)

TAKES PLACE: once at the end of each month

PLATFORM: Zoom (discord’s buggy)

HOW DOES IT WORK: 
- an specific number of acts is presented to the public (live) - interested members should apply one week prior to the show to organize the show better and avoid having long intermissions between acts like happened in the Fall ‘21 graduation ceremony.

WHAT IT WOULD ACCOMPLISH: help DAO members try something new/express themselves, helping to connect w other members through new experiences and the inside jokes that develop from it

### 4️⃣ Gaming Night

TAKES PLACE:

PLATFORM: a game that’s free and accessible—EX: Roblox, Minecraft, 

***for games with server that aren’t as inclusive for all locations, we can separate those gaming nights by location

GAMING PLATFORM: zoom, gaming platform (Ex: Roblox website)

HOW DOES IT WORK: potential gamers join via zoom, and someone can either screen share (if it’s a group game) or the ppl on the zoom can see each other through their other device (or gaming platform). Gaming will continue for as long as needed or until timing is late

ACCOMPLISHES..: Gamers will be able to bond with previous experiences instead of new ones (AKA Gaming knowledge)
