# Working Group Updates

Date: April 22, 2022

# What have we achieved till date?

1. Hosted 9+ Solarpunk Study Group Calls with an average attendance of 4.6 people (almost close to 5 but still not it)
2. 23 Learning Togethers with an average attendance of 13 (indicates we either need to work on timings, or reach out to more Builders/Champions or get more +1s into a call!
3. Seven amazing Dream Journal updates released since the beginning
4. 22 People have had intros using the [Intros.ai](http://Intros.ai) platform, but, intros by more than 40 people have been held and/or scheduled outside this initiative!
    1. Despite a highly positive feedback mechanism, there is a very low scheduling(60%) + feedback rate (21%) (just for the automated platform)
    2. The stats and the emerging role of 1:1s in the Dream DAO signify that this process needs to be less automated and more encouraged. **But how do we move to get more people meet each other and connect?**
5. Dream DAO Community Events with a very low attendance rate.
    1. Major reasons
        1. Lack of time (people have certain commitments)
        2. Lack of context for events
        3. Lack of outreach within and outside the voting community
        4. Lack of involvement for non-voting community @the Dream DAO

# What’s coming?

1. Discuss about DAO Culture for the current and coming seasons
Need 2 folx to cohost a meeting with me for the coming first week of May on having a JamOut on DAO culture for season 2.  For that we need to discuss-
    1. Builder Principles
    2. Champion Principles
    3. Non-voting Community Involvement
    4. Does anything define our direct our culture?
    5. How do we associate ‘connections’ in different prespectives @The Dream DAO
2. Releasing the Second Version of the Community Health Survey before the end of Season 1- The DAO Pulse Check (as shared by @Carl Cervonne here- [https://www.notion.so/cerv1/DAO-Pulse-Checks-8dba984f46d44d6393851276e5cff2d6](https://www.notion.so/DAO-Pulse-Checks-8dba984f46d44d6393851276e5cff2d6?pvs=21))
    1. Jam async on this, get an initial idea of what questions need to be put in (by the end of next week, May1st)
    2. Understand the target audience (by the end of next week, May1st)
    3. Work on reaching out to people to fill the survey (by May 8th)
3. Plugging more Builders, Friends and Champions in
Having more 1:1s + Junto like discussions + Spontaneous hangouts, how do we get ahead with this?
4. Resuming the Discussion on Pluralistic Contributions
5. Hosting JamOuts
JamOuts are a mix of a hangout and a jam upon certain concern.
6. Come up with a second draft of list of events we can plan out for Season 2
