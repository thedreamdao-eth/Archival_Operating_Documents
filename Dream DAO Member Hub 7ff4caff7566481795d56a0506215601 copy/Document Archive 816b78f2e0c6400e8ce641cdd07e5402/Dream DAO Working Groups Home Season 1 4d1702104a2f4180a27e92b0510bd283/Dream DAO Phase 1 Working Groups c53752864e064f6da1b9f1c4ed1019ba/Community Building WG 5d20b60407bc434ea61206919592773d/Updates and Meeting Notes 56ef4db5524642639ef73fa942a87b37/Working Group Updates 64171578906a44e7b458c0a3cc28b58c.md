Hi @Community Building WG ,
while we are having our call on <t:1645894800:F>, here are a few updates I have for yâ€™all-

:one:The Work on following Tasks commences/continues/will start this week-

> Member of the Day FeatureCommunity Health SurveyDeveloping V1 of the Merit Badge SystemIntroducing Fun Events/Work Togethers for Phase 1 (Currently 3 in Ideation)The DREAM JournalDeveloping the Intros Club + TestimonialsCo-Creation of the Solarpunk Vision DocumentContinuing with the Solarpunk Study GroupDeveloping a Micro-Plugin Kit for helping less engaged members plug in + onboarding!The Dream DAO UserflowImprove on HODLer Participation (More inputs after the call we have!)
> 

:two:As I am unable to edit the lead column in the official task list of the DAO, **I am creating threads for all but #3rd Task above**, tagging each of the assignees in those threads.
(Donâ€™t worry about cluttering the space or smth, **join the threads where you are tagged** :joy:, you can always peep into some or the other thread without joining it!)
(But remember, you can participate in those discussions if the work on your part is done/ going good :grin:)

:three:**Lastly,**
Iâ€™d encourage all of **the assignees to have a call to discuss their work**. I know this is a lot of work for me, but such an arrangement keeps work decentralised and easier to manage for the assignees.

â†’ If this is effective by the first week of March, we can either do away with the calls as a group or use them as spaces to brainstorm for new tasks/ answering questions. This would mitigate the problem with time zones!

(BUT AS OF NOW, PLEASE TRY JOINING THE CALL WE HAVE on <t:1645894800:F>)

Thanks a lot for your patience and react with a :heartpulse: once you read this message!

Hit me with questions if any!
