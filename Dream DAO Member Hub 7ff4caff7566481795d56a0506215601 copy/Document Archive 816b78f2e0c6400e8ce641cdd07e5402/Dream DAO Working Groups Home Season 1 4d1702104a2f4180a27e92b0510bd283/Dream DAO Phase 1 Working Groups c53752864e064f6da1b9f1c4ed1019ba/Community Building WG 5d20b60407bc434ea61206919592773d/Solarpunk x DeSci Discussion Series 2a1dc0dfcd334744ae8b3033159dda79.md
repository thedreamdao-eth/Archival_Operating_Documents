# Solarpunk x DeSci Discussion Series

# Rationale

We often have had our Solarpunk discussions revolving around the philosophy of regeneration, trust and the grey area between prudence and optimism. Getting a chance to find the intersection between the future and what makes the future a reality may not give us the solutions to achieve it on a short term basis but will leave us with stirring questions and ideas that the community can leverage to an unbelievable extent
