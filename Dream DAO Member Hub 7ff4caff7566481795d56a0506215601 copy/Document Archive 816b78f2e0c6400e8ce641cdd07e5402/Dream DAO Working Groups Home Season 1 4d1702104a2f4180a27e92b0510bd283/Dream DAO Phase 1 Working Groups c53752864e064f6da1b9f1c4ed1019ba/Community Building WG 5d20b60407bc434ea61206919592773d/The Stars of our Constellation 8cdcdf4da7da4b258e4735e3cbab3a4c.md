# The shift in perspectives

Looking back upon the baby steps we took together, weâ€™ve grown so much, and often this growth may not what we plan to live up to, but end up loving the direction where it leads us to. There are 3 major changes + reflections that have steered us to rethink our standing on Community Building-

1. Creation of new working groups for the new season- IRL Events working groups help us meet the targets similar to old goals #1 and #5
2. Importance of clarityâ†’
    1. Clarity (more of increasing awareness) in terms of opportunities we have for people to plug in
    2. Clarity in helping people plugging in by having avenues like follow ups and bounty boards, etc.

 and outreach within the DreamerZ community

1. Potential Breadth of events on the basis of discussion, length, role access and time zone
    1. 

# New Systemic Goals + KPIs for the working group

Just like the stars that make a constellation, the systemic goals below are, HUGE,

the sub-goals we would ideate in the Dream Jamouts are like the atoms of Hydrogen that power these huge goals, and make a dream Constellation

# Conversation

- Best LTs were the ones where we collaborated + Discussed things more. If we ensure better of-
    1. Discussion (like treks at CU)
    2. Outreach
    3. Clarity
    
- Getting clarity of responsibility and more personalisation to contribution
    - Getting a foundation of what contribution means at the Dream DAO and Web3 space in general is a first step towards personalised, meaningful and strong contribution to the entire Web3 Space
    - Initially in the learning together sessions, there was a need of more Web3 basics discussions (both async as well as in-sync)
    - Having a system that manages learning about Web3
- Junto Guides should be builders
    
    â†’ get experience in managing micro communities
    
    â†’ create a safe space to approach each other of different roles
    
- Create a mentorship system before season 2
    
    Helps setting the foundation for a seamless onboarding by the seasonâ€™s beginning
