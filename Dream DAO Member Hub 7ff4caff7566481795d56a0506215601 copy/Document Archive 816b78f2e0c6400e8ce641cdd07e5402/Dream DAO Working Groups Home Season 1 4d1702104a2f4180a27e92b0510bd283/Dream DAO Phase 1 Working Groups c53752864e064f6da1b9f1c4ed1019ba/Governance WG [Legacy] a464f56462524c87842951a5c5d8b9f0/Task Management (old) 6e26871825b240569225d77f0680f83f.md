# Task Management (old)

**Following the governance meeting on April 15:**

[Updated Compensation Proposal](Task%20Management%20(old)%206e26871825b240569225d77f0680f83f/Updated%20Compensation%20Proposal%20699d32b31c704f8b94b322e90bb4a460.md)

Overall Goals: 

We want to create a compensation system that is transparent, fair, and quantitative. We also want to emphasize flexibility as our DAO priorities shift quickly. We tried to gamify some aspects of it while also leaving plenty of incentives for people to take on tasks. 

## Task Management

- utilize clarity to keep track of task completion and payouts
- Example of a Task layout below

![Untitled](Task%20Management%20(old)%206e26871825b240569225d77f0680f83f/Untitled.png)

There are several key components that differ from Notion: Reviewers and Rewards. The Reviewer is the only one that can sign off on a task being completed then Clarity will log that the rewards should be paid out. (automated payouts aren’t possible yet but we’ll basically get an excel sheet at the end)

Reviewers should usually be champions, should foster more builder-champion interaction. The Lead (usually wg coordinator) can determine which contributors are working on it, priority, and due date. The reviewer can be whatever champion wants to step up or the default can be whoever the elected official ends up being. 

## Compensation System

Needs to be transparent, mostly objective

We can mint 1000 nontransferable tokens at the start of each phase w each token representing .1% of that phases compensation pool (will be a moving target 20-50k, based on total funding, so theres some element of surprise)

600 tokens go towards task based compensation

200 tokens go towards community/taco based compensation

100 tokens in giveaways/fun events

100 tokens as a buffer for wg distribution/non wg DAO tasks

Example distribution ($30k allocation, 1000 tokens)

| Category | allocation %, number of tokens | total $ allocation | note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task Based Compensation | 60%, 600 | $18k | a 5 token reward would be worth $150 |
| Community awards/Tacos | 20%, 200 | $6k |  |
| Giveaways/events | 10%, 100 | $3k |  |
| Buffer for wg | 10%, 100 | $3k |  |

Task Based Compensation

- Each working group will be given a certain amount of tokens at the beginning of each phase based on the estimated work to be done by builders for that wg.
    - wg token distribution can be based on the previous phases # of man hours spent/total contributions
    - 
- Can use Clarity to assign tasks and create bounties with this token payout structure.

Taco based compensation

- compensation will be paid out based on tacos accrued during that phase, payout will be logarithmic with a max cap, not linear

example payout (might be a bit high):

| Tacos | $ per person |
| --- | --- |
| 250+ | $250  |
| 100+ | $225 |
| 50+ | $200 |
| 25+ | $150 |

End of phase bonus compensation:

- rewards based on other types of contributions (mario party type end of game rewards)
- a subcommittee can be formed to nominate winners of each award, which can then be put to a DAO wide vote (1st place 70%, 2nd place 30%) or something not a 100-0 distribution
    - most “gms” said
    - most tacos given
    - best memes
    - most solarpunk

Buffer for wg distribution/DAO wide tasks

- a certain wg might pick up more work throughout the phase e.g. fundraising wg might get more work as Dream DAO awareness spreads
- a wg can request tokens from this pool if they are about to run out during the phase as priorities can shift quickly
- any tasks that don’t belong to a specific wg can utilize this token allocation

Questions?

Do we need a task manager? does the wg coordinator fill that role

- seems like we need someone to follow up when things aren’t getting completed
- maybe that should be the wg coordinators responsibility since coordinators are being compensated

Who decides when and how many tokens to give out?

- I think WG coordinators and champions of each wg can work together on this for each task. If there’s any reoccurring tasks like the Dream Journal, can just budget tokens based on how many tokens for that phase that wg gets.

What is the minimum contribution for a token?

- will need to be an iterative learning process to balance supply/demand of how many people want to take on tasks. one metric can just be hourly based compensation, one token per hour of work would equate to $20 per hour potentially, but might deter people from taking on larger tasks and instead take on many small low hanging fruit tasks.

Should champions be compensated?

- I think yes if they take on tasks solo, but if working in tandem w a builder the token should probably go to them. champions can also burn their token so that the distribution pool ends up being small at end of phase. Ultimately yes, but champions have many ways to redistribute their comp if they want.

Seems logical that wg coordinators be in charge of task management, deciding how many tokens a task is worth, but there will be conflict of self interest as they will be assigning themselves tasks, how do we avoid that?

- maybe we just have the reviewer (most of the time will be champions) of each task determine how many tokens are rewarded

Is there a way to check how many tokens each person has earned throughout the phase? 

- probably, but need to confirm

notes:

tokens represent contributions to the DAO within each phase, can be a resume builder, we will mint a different set of tokens in each phase

probably need an example of a small, medium, and large task that can provide a baseline to compare to when deciding how many tokens a task is worth. e.g. dream journal is a large task (5-10 tokens) or something

pros

- makes everything quantitative, transparent
- gamifies the compensation system to create incentives
- adds a surprise element (moving target for the compensation pool)
- provides incentive for people to take on more tasks, be more active in the community
- can switch to a different compensation system w each phase
- represents on chain proof of contributions to the DAO

cons

- will inevitably be somewhat controversial when deciding how many tokens each wg gets
- hard to be decentralized if a select individual or group of individuals chooses how many tokens each task is worth, although probably a more fair distribution than what we have currently
