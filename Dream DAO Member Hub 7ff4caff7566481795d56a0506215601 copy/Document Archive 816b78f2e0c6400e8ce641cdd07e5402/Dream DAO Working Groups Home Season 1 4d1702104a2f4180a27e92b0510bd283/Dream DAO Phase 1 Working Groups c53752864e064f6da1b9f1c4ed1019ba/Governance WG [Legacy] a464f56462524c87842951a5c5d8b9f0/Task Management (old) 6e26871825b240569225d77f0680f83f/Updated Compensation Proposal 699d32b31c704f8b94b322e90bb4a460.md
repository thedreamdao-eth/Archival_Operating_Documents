# Updated Compensation Proposal

```
This update follows from the governance working group discussion on April 15.
```

# Overall goals

We want to create a compensation system that is transparent, fair, and quantitative. We also want to emphasize flexibility as our DAO priorities shift quickly. We tried to gamify some aspects of it while also leaving plenty of incentives for people to take on tasks. 

# Two macro forms of compensation

1. Merit (voting power)
2. Financial (money)

***This page is focused on financial compensation only.***

# Three types of financial compensation

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è The types of compensation will probably change over the course of the DAO‚Äôs life. These represent the first three types that we‚Äôve agreed are necessary for DAO operations and motivating members for positive contributions.

</aside>

- üò∫¬†**STIPENDS - flat compensation for cohorts of Builders and Explorers**
    
    This is the simplest and most equitable form of compensation.
    
    There are several options for distributing stipends:
    
    - Lump sums - a single payment, making it very easy to administer
        - *On joining* - best if getting in was the hard part
        - *On completion* - best if you want to reward people for making it to the end
    - Regular installments (eg, monthly) - best for managing cashflow and motivating people to remain active until the end
    - Token streams (eg, [Superfluid](https://www.superfluid.finance/home)) - crypto version of regular installments whereby you get tokens streamed to your wallet every second
    
    In order to implement stipends, three questions need to be addressed:
    
    1. How big are the stipends? (eg, 0.1 ETH // 300 USDC)
    2. Who is eligible for stipends and for how long? (eg, all Builders are eligible for 4 months or until the end of the season)
        1. What happens for people who join mid-season? Is it pro-rated?
    3. What makes a person no longer eligible for a stipend? (eg, they are inactive for 1 week with no notice)
    
    Once these questions are answered, we can prepare a Snapshot proposal for **Stipends.**
    
- üí™ **CORE TEAM - time-based compensation for a small team of core contributors**
    
    This is the equivalent of full- or part-time work, based on an annual or monthly .
    
    There are two options for compensating core team members:
    
    - Regular installments (eg, every month or every two weeks) - this is how web2 employees normally receive compensation
    - Token streams (eg, [Superfluid](https://www.superfluid.finance/home)) - crypto version of regular installments whereby you get tokens streamed to your wallet every second
    
    In order to implement salaries, three questions need to be addressed:
    
    1. What are the permanent compensated roles that are required in the DAO?
        - DAO Steward
        - DAO Coordinator
        - WG Coordinators
    2. What compensation is associated with each role?
        1. Gary: see here: [https://www.notion.so/cucrew/Season-1-Situational-Assessment-and-Season-2-Pre-Launch-Checklist-9b013fe713aa4feb8c6a2a1aa0e63c10#d66a8276420c40949d413fcae346de82](../../../../../Design%20Documents%20&%20Braindumps%2096c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae/Season%201%20Situational%20Assessment%20and%20Season%202%20Pre-L%209b013fe713aa4feb8c6a2a1aa0e63c10.md)
    3. How often should the DAO review performance and compensation for core contributors?
        1. Gary: Minimum once per season before a new Season starts. Probably once in the middle too.
    
    Once these questions are answered, we can prepare a Snapshot proposal for **Core Team Compensation.**
    
- üí∏¬†**BOUNTIES - fixed amount of compensation distributed to one or more DAO members based on contribution**
    
    Bounties are a way of compensating DAO members for important contributions that go beyond normal contribution / active participation in the DAO. 
    
    Some bounties will be *evergreen bounties* and known far in advance; these can be set at the start of a season. These are well-suited for activities that are needed each season, but don‚Äôt require a permanent steward to manage / achieve continuity across seasons.
    
    The DAO can also propose *project-based bounties* in the middle of a season and offer a fixed bounty for successfully fulfilling the project‚Äôs requirements.
    
    At the start of each season, the DAO should try to allocate a total budget for both forms of bounty-based compensation. 
    
    ü§î Some fictional bounty examples (for illustration purposes only):
    
    - **Contribute to the Dream DAO blog**. Each approved entry of at least 500 words will be compensated with 20 USDC. We will award up to five bounties. Only active Builders are eligible to submit. An individual may submit multiple articles, but can only win one bounty. *This could be an evergreen bounty.*
    - **Update the Dream DAO website.** A team from will be assembled from within the DAO and can earn a bounty of 500 USDC if the website meets the desired spec. The team  must use Coordinape (or similar) to track contributions and allocate the bounty. *This could be a project-based bounty.*
    - **Submit a grant proposal to fund the DAO**. The DAO will allocate up to 1000 USDC in bounties for grant proposals this season. To qualify for the bounty, a grant proposal must be cleared for submission by the DAO‚Äôs governance committee. If grants are being worked on by teams, then members must use Coordinape (or similar) to track contributions. When a proposal is approved by the governance committee, the it will also be assigned up to three difficulty points (1 = easy proposal, 3 = difficult proposal). At the end of the season, the DAO will summarize all grant qualifying proposals and add up their associated points. Then, the total bounty of 1000 USDC will be allocated pro-rata based on difficulty points, up to a max of 100 USDC per difficulty point per grant proposal. (The max bounty for a difficult proposal is 300 USDC and the max bounty for an easy proposal is 100 USDC. If the DAO submits lots of proposals and therefore has more than 10 points, then the amount of USDC allocated per difficulty point is discounted.) *This could be an evergreen bounty.*
    
    Given that bounties require more overhead and coordination, it‚Äôs advisable to start with a small number (eg, 3-5) for the first season.

# Budgeting compensation over a season

These types of compensation can be integrated into a simple budget for the season. The following is **mock budget** assuming a `4 month` season:

| Activity | Type | Budget | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Builders | Stipend | 2.5 ETH | 0.1 ETH x 25 Builders  |
| DAO Steward | Core team | 28,000 USDC | 4 months salary allocation |
| DAO Coordinator | Core team | 4,000 USDC | 4 months part-time allocation |
| Blogging | Bounty | 400 USDC | 20 USDC per article |
| Grant proposals | Bounty | 1,000 USDC | Fixed cap, but hopefully 5+ proposals |
| Projects TBD | Bounty | 2,000 USDC | Placeholder for other bounties |
| TOTAL |  | 2.5 ETH and 35,400 USDC  |  |

# Other ways of recognizing DAO contributions

- The DAO will continue to use tacos to show community love and recognize cool contributions by members.
- The DAO will continue to give out POAPs when people show up at virtual and IRL events.
- The DAO will also develop and roll-out merit badges for DAO members. Badges are not a form of compensation, although there may be some correlation. For example, a ‚Äúwriter‚Äù badge could be given out when a Builder completes their first blog entry and an ‚Äúexpert writer‚Äù badge could be given out when a Builder completes 5 blog entries.
- The DAO will continue to track participation as a means of ensuring Builders remain active and as input for badges and other DAO opportunities (ie, core team roles, Explorers program, etc)

# üß†¬†Open Questions

**Stipends for Builders (and Explorers):**

- [ ]  How should the Stipend be paid (these are the three most popular options):
    - `50% start / 50% end`
    - `0% start / 100% end`
    - `1/X% per month (over X months)`
- [ ]  What constitutes ‚Äúactive‚Äù participation for the entirety of a season?
- [ ]  Can people join mid-way through the season? If so, is there a cut-off for latecomers?

**Compensation for Core Team:**

- [ ]  How frequently should compensation happen?
    - `Monthly`
    - `Every two weeks`
- [ ]  Are any other permanent roles needed to provide continuity across seasons?

**Bounties:**

- [ ]  Are there more examples of evergreen bounties, ie, things we want to accomplish each season but it‚Äôs important to mix up the people, eg:
    - Grant applications
    - POAPs
    - Learning together operations
    - Dream DAO blogs
    

**Meeting ideas:**

- 1. Grants / Airdrop - when Builders join to have "pocket money" for playing in web3
- 2. Stipend for Builders or progressive Grants - unlockeds over course of a season
- 3. Bounties - for big lifts or taking a key role during the season
- 4. "Salary" - for core roles that persisent across seasons (core team + WG Leads)
- Builders will be levelling up if they‚Äôre active
-
