# Election Process Overview

The election process is designed to be flexible and asynchronous out of respect for the different time zones builders are located in, and to encourage maximum engagement in line with builders’ busy schedules. The goal was to maximize the amount of election activity done with existing tools and minimize new tool adoption to reduce friction in the election process and minimize onboarding time. As such, all election activity aside from voting will take place in a Discord channel created for the purpose. To encourage all DAO members to participate and ensure they have the information they need to make an informed decision, a special edition of the Dream Journal will also be created and distributed through email that summarizes candidate statements and election updates.

The steps to voting participation, including writing the candidate statement, determining voter and candidate eligibility, voting, ensuring election integrity, and transitioning responsibility, are outlined below.

## Election Timeline

- April 2nd-April 15th: Election process design + operations (handling logistics)
- April 16th-April 29th: Solidifying voting design + operations.
- April 16th-April 22nd: Selecting people for the election committee and implementing election process
- April 30th-May 6th: Implementing voting system. The election channel will be made on April 30th, and candidates must submit their information by 11:59 PM EST on May 3 in the channel. The rest of the week will be dedicated to preparing the special election edition of the DREAM journal.
- April 25th-May 8th: Prepare for the election by sending out information about the candidates, how to vote, important dates, and etc.)
- May 9th: Official date of the election. **The ballot will be open for three days to give people time to vote.**

## Voter Eligibility

Every Dream DAO builder who holds a SkywalkerZ and has been involved in the community at any point, irrespective of the size of their contribution and recent engagement, will get one vote. This includes builders who are currently considered inactive. The ranked-choice voting process is outlined in a different document. 

**Ensuring voter engagement** 

Preventing low voter engagement and having a contingency plan in the case of low vote count is essential to ensure everyone’s voice is heard. 

Prevention:

- Send 2-3 emails about the election to builders and champions
- DM inactive builders and champions to remind them about the election
- Give out “I voted” POAPs to encourage engagement
- Create an easy to understand guide to voting (ex: how to vote on Snapshot/other voting platform)

Solution:

- Extend the deadline to vote
- Having a voters’ hangout time (basically our equivalent of a voting hotline)+ collaborating with the Dream DAO support team to answer any questions about voting

## Candidate Eligibility

To run to be the facilitator of a working group, the prospective candidate must be a SkywalkerZ hodler and have made at least one contribution to that working group. To keep the election process as smooth as possible, builders can only run to be the leader of one working group. Working group facilitators will be builders. 

## Candidate Statement

Once the election channel has been created in the Dream DAO discord, each DAO contributor who wants to be considered for the role of working group lead will submit a candidate statement. The candidate statement must be submitted within 3 days of the creation of the election channel. The candidate statement will also be made available on Snapshot so voters can read it during the actual voting process. 

**Guidelines** 

The candidate statement should cover their motivations for running to be a working group facilitator, a history of their involvement with the Dream DAO community, with a focus on their contributions to key projects they’ve worked on, and the skills and qualifications they bring to the role. The candidate statement should be no more than 250 words in length to ensure community members have time to look through all the candidates. Candidates will not be allowed to campaign for the position outside of this statement. For the duration of the election process, any candidate found violating this guideline by reaching out to people through direct messages on Discord, posting about their candidacy on Twitter, or any form of self-promotion outside of the candidate statement  will be automatically disqualified from the election. Candidates are free to learn in public and share their experience participating in the process **after** voting has concluded. 

## Ensuring Election Integrity

To enforce election guidelines, ensure transparency around the process and allow as much organized community accountability on the election as possible, during the voting process, people will cast **closed ballots.** The logistics surrounding this will be ironed out during the period when the Snapshot vote is set up. 

An election board of at least 2 neutral builders who are not running for the position and one champion advisor will be created on a volunteer basis. At least one builder or champion from each working group will be on the board, and the size can increase depending on builder interest. The responsibilities of the board will be as follows:

- monitor the Discord to ensure candidates are abiding by the rules of the election
- field questions about the election process and responses to concerns about the election from community members
- ensure all guidelines are followed during the voting process, with support from the governance working group
- work with the governance working group to draft announcements to the wider Dream DAO community if there is a problem with the election process

These responsibilities can be divided up among board members depending on the different time zones and schedules of those who volunteer to be a part of this group. 

To select the election board, a call for volunteers will be distributed through email and Discord 48 hours before the election begins, and interested community members will have 24 hours to register their interest through a typeform. The process will be first come first serve.
