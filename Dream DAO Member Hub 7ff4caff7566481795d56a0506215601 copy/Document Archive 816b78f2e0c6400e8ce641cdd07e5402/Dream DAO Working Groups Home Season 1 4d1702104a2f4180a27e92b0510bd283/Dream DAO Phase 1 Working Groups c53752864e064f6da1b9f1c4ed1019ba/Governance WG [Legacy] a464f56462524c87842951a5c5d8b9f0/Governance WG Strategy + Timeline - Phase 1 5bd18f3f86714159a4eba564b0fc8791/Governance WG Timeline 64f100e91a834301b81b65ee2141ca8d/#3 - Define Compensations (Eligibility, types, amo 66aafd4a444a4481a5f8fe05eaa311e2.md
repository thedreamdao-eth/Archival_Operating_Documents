# #3 - Define Compensations (Eligibility, types, amounts, etc)

Time Frame: May 20, 2022
Notes: After the first two steps are done, we can decide on how to utilize the WG budget. Aspects include: Eligibility (Who’s an “active member”, any persistent WG Roles other than the coordinator?)
Type (role salary / bounty per task / active member compensation)
Amount (per each compensation type) - I think it will be defines in the budget proposal already
