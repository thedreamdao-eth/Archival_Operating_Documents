# Draft Season 2 Governance OKRs

## ðŸŽ¯ Draft V1

- **Hold Phase 3 Elections (WG Leads + Persistent roles)**
    - Find a web3-native platform where nobody sees who voted - ***our first bounty***
    - **Create a doc that outlines the whole process for the elections person/committee!**
        - Make sure to include:
            - How to set up WG Lead Voting
            - How to set up Persistent Roles Voting
            - Possible issues + how to resolve them
            - Guidelines around 1:1 campaigning
- **Develop a policy for participant mobility**
    - How people move through Dream DAO
        - Builders (Alumni system)
        - Champions
    - **Clarify &** **Document the process(es)**
- **Build a Reward System**
    - Financial Compensation System (revisit the old doc and refine to fit current circumstances (current paid roles, Clarity implementation, etc))
    - **Build the Merit System**
        - Should we incorporate it in DAO Voting?
- **Further decentralize the DAO and empower working groups to run more autonomously**
    - Each working group submits OKRs and a budget to achieve them within two weeks of the new season
    - Each working group has at least three highly active contributors (including the working group lead)
    - Pulse checks mid-way and at the end of the season show an average NPS of X for the DAO and for the performance of each working group
        - Check out this resource from Bankless DAO for inspiration

    - Implement closed-ballot (anonymous) voting
    - Ensure there are more than two qualified candidates (based on merit) for each working group lead
    - Improve documentation and tooling for holding elections, so less is required from Madison. Make sure to include:
        - How to set up WG Lead Voting
        - How to set up Persistent Roles Voting
        - Possible issues + how to resolve them
        - Guidelines around 1:1 campaigning
