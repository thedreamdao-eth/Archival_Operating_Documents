# Merit System (for Compensations + Contribution checking)

<aside>
❗ This page is dedicated for designing the part of the Reward System of Dream DAO - the Merit System. Here we work on designing a system that rewards the tasks / activities we don’t need compensations for with Merit, which can possible be transferred into more feasible rewards.

- Key Points
    - Merit System ≠ Financial Reward/Compensation
        - “Lower value contributions are rewarded with Merit”
            - We need to define what task has a lower or higher value
        - What differentiates merits and bounties
        - What activities/tasks are considered for merit
        - Would there be different level of merit (e.g. tier 1, 2, or 3, etc)
            - If so, what are they and how do we define them
    - Different types of merits (badges)([https://www.notion.so/The-Dream-DAO-Merit-System-d0625913c50d442b83c182ded4c94e24#329c2dad865c4ce5a5138105381142bd](https://www.notion.so/The-Dream-DAO-Merit-System-d0625913c50d442b83c182ded4c94e24?pvs=21))*

- **Issues** Regarding Season 1’s proposal
    - Meritocracy (Activeness = voting power)
        - Does not fully align with DreamDAO’s democratic approach
    - Would the merit system really motivate and encourage people to be more active?
        - Or would builders & champions rather pursue bounties or tasks with financial compensation?
    - What does the merit system do other than awarding people a digital badge?
        - If possible, perhaps we can:
            - Always put those with many merits as priority when it comes to signing up for online/offline events and/or opportunities.

___________________________________________________________________________

- **Questions?**
    - How are we going to define activeness?

___________________________________________________________________________

- **Agenda for our next meeting**
    - Meet up with other org/daos (Gitcoin, Refi) for feedback to evaluate how valid this idea is
        - Champions (QZ, Thessy)

Notes:

- Madhav
    - Mint the Merit NFTs on Polygon( either we could mint to a wallet with zero gas for the receiver or set up link for gasless minting)
    - Monthly merit badges (according to how much they contributed to within that month)
- Carl
    - Using POAPs as Merit badges
    - Propose the merit badges to the WGs and ask what they want to reward merit for
- Madison
    - We should agree on what we use the merit system
    - agree with Madison’s idea of having certain merit badges for qualifying for certain perks.
    - Bounties should come with merit badges
- David
    - More generous of merit badges
        - Simple and straight-forward
        - Merit vs Bounties

Madhav: What about giving merit badges at the end of every month to every single wg member according to their activity and contributions in that specific month + also badges could be minted for small bounties???

## Past thoughts / ideas:

The merit system is a more activity-based system where you do something that is optional and is net positive for the community(Like giving away tacos or voting)

- A merit reward opposed to financial reward

### The value of a contribution:

- Lower value contributions are rewarded with Merit

Governance may need to consider what is high value or low value

- If someone wants to reward for attendance it’s pretty minor, but if it’s more a operational requirement that goes through governance and a committee vote with budget associated
    - There may have to be a decision to compensate financially as well
    - If someone voluntarily does a lot of work at the high end of merit they should be also compensated financially

### What is a community wide but simple activity like voting?

### What is a skills based time required project?

### What is the break point between merit and bounty like activity?

- Everything up to a very well-thought-out proposal is the upper end of the merit system and everything down to passing a proposal through is the low end of the bounty system.
- The proposal will determined how big the bounty is in the first place

### What is the spectrum of the merit system’s activities?

- Voting on a proposal vs proposing the proposal
- Attending an event vs delivering content for the event

### The spectrum of activities in voting can be accounted for by:

- A weighted average of the simple activities (i.e. merit badge that has 1/10 the value for just voting and one with more value for a proposing and getting submitted/completed)
- If there are 30 proposals if you voted 30 times it doesn’t necessarily mean you provided more value than someone who voted a couple of times but submitted proposals…

### How should we classify the different tiers of merit?

- Tiers from low value merit to high value merit
- Like from giving community love in the form of tacos to being sent voting power or unique POAPs for voluntary high-value contributions
- We can have a 2-way merit reward system that gives POAPs unique to the activity and non-transferable tokens for DAO-wide low importance governance decisions

**For our meeting on Friday we will further discuss the spectrum of activities in the merit system and how to classify them…**
