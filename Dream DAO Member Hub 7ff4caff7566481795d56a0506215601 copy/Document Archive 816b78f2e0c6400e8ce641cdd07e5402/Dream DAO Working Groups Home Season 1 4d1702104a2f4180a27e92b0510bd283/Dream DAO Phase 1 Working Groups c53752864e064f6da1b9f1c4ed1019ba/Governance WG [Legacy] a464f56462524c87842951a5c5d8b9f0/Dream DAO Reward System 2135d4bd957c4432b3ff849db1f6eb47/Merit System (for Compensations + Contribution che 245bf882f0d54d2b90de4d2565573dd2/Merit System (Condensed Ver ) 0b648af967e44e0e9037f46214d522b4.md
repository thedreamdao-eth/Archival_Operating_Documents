# Merit System (Condensed Ver.)

- Definitions
    - **Merit System** ≠ Financial Reward/Compensation
        - “Lower value contributions are rewarded with Merit”
        - Low-tech, simple way to **verify** someone’s (specific and/or general) contribution for small and large communities
    - **Merit Badges** = Boyscout-like badges that recognizes one’s achievement in DreamDAO
- **Main Functions** of the Merit System (Merit System = **Metric system that measures activity**)
    - Recognizing Active Engagement
        - By awarding badges ([https://www.notion.so/5425c776af52438ca0885c812f695b86?v=bfbd055718594c14bdbd6b3f94e7433d](https://www.notion.so/5425c776af52438ca0885c812f695b86?pvs=21))
    - Non-financial Motivation
        - Encouraging members to engage in activities to win a badge
            - (e.g.) voting, filling out a form, etc
    - **Resume** (Utility)
        - System to track and record contributions
            - Easier way to go back and verify someone’s work
        - Way to **qualify** for certain perks (Members will **more merit badges** will be at top-priority when it comes to selecting members for):
            - Conferences
            - Events
            - Opportunities
- **How it works** (Flow)
    - Be active
    - Pursue a task/activity
    - Get a merit badge
    - Build a merit resume (record of your contributions)
    - Put them to use (qualify for perks)

___________________________________________________________________________________

- Key Terms
    - Active Members = Members with many/different merit badges
    - Inactive Members = Member with little to no merit badges
    - Many merit badges & Less merit badges = By the **discretion** of WG leads
        - Establishing a baseline for the whole DAO **(data-driven)**
        - The baseline will change as we collect more data

___________________________________________________________________________________

- Platform/Tools (POAPs, etc)
    - Discord (measuring metrics) (build the merit system (simple/straight-forward)
        - Bots
    - POAPs (more complicated)
    - Github & Clarity (joint WG contributions)
    - **Using the tools we already have** (specifying its intent)
    - ***Need help here***

___________________________________________________________________________________

- Extra Ideas
    - Pilot Program
        - We will run a short pilot program for the Merit System within the WGs
        - The WGs will implement the rough-draft merit system within their WG to acknowledge its members contributions
        - We will gather data from this test run to patch flaws and evaluate how effective the current version of the merit system is.
    - **Bounties Recognition**
        - **Issue a merit badge along with a bounty** so that whoever completes a bounty has someone form of certificate to **verify that they contributed**
    
    - Levels of Merit (based off the Governance WG)
        - Base-level: Given to all members
            - e.g.) For WG, all members will receive a merit badge that **proves that they are a member (attendance) (one badge)**
        - Second-level **(two or more badges)**
            - Those who take and complete specific tasks
                - Designer, Educator, Builder, etc
        - Third-level (indisputable merit) **(Combination of having many second-level merit badges)**

___________________________________________________________________________________

- **Task for next week**
    - Test the merit badge by giving out badges to those who completed bounties
        - Understanding how difficult/simple it is to make and issue a merit badge
        - Generally testing out how it works in a real-life scenario

WG Meeting notes: 

- Merit system shoud be self-governing (like a form that builders submit once they do something meritable)
- Mid September (can we create a timeline?)
- Each wg decides and stewards
- Self-managing merit system — can people request their own and it is rewarded / not rewarded
- DALLE creates the badges
- Let's come up with the primary list of badges and see if each wg needs unique badges. I'm anticipating that there would be so many badges that they will lose value/impact
