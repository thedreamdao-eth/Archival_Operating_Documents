# Phase 2 Governance WG Strategy

Our [key results](Governance%20WG%20in%20Season%202%207538a4c8c3a8416cba1924d3b0457068.md) require **two** major systems/policies to be built by the end of Phase 2:

1. **Merit System**
2. **Active Member Policy**

These systems tend to be more time-consuming compared to the other things we have to do in Phase 2 (e.g. Improving the Election process, creating a Dream DAO Governance System explanation, etc), so they should take more of our attention and efforts = more GWG meetings.

For these two big tasks we will use the same strategy based on design docs and sync/async WG feedback, while also spending 1-2 meetings on minor issues like Election Process and Dream DAO Governance System Manual. 

This strategy will help us meet our Key Results in time and increase meeting efficiency by discussing design docs and assigning tasks instead of doing things that could be done async.
