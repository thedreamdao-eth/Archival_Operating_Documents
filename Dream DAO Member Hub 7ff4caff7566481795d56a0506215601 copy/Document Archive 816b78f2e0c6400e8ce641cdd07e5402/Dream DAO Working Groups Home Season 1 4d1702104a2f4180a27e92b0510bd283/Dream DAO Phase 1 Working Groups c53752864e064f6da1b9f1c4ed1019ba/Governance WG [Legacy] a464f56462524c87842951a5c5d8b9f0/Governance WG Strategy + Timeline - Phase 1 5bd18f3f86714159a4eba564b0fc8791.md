# Governance WG Strategy + Timeline - Phase 1

The general strategy is 3 weeks for each task with tasks **overlapping** after the 1st week. 

Hereâ€™s how it works:
**Week 1** - some wg members with experience create a design document, which will be discussed during the meeting at the end of the week. *The meeting can be up to an hour* to accommodate all of the live feedback and discussion on the doc. *At the end of this Meeting the next task is announced and volunteers with experience are chosen to start writing the next design doc.*

***Week 2 and 3 are of each task are asynchronous by the selected volunteers.***

**Week 2** - The WG finalizes the design doc asynchronously. The proposal is created and posted.

**Week 3** - Changes are being implemented through updating and solidifying the related documentation and establishing a Committee / Interim group members responsible for implementation in the DAO.

**This will help us:** 

- Meet our Key Results in time!
- Increase Meeting efficiency by discussing design docs and assigning tasks instead of doing things that can be done async.
- Ensure diverse engagement in the WG, as the next design doc task is going to be asssigned before the previous one is finished.
