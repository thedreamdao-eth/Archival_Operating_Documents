What to Learn From The Program ðŸŒ•: Juntos: small groups, led by mentor-like figures, that meet on a weekly basis to discuss what they are learning/get to know each other. We could do juntos, but have them be led by mentors that also sync 1:1 with explorers on a bi-weekly basis. In juntos, Explorers could discuss their independent learning journeys + important web3 x social impact projects.
