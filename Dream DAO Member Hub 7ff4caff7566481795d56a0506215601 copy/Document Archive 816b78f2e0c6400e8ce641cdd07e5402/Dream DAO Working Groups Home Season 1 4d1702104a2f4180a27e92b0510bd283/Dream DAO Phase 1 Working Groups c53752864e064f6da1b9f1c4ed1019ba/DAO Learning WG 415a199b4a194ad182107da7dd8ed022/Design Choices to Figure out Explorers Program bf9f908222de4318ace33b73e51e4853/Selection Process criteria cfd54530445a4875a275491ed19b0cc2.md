# Selection Process / criteria

Tentative thoughts as a group (led by Gary): All Dream DAO builders?
→ I think so

Who is selecting? 
→ Rank choice voting, with people with most merit points listed first

How does the merit system play into this?
→ See above

Is there voting?
→ See above

Are we factoring in DEI in this?
→ I think so. Need people from multiple continents. Definitely US representation. Definitely BIPOC representation. 
Asynchronous Thoughts/Ideas: Are the first ones chosen by Cu people or the DAO Memebers as we are working on seting up avoting system - Madhav

Madison: People should also be able to answer a set of questions that let them demonstrate their interest/commitment to more or less campaign for the spot (but there should be restrictions around this). Another question is how will we do voting if we don’t want a specific cap/we want everyone interested to be a part of it? 

Agree on application to show interest and commitment, If builders can be explorers, are builders also voting? Ale
