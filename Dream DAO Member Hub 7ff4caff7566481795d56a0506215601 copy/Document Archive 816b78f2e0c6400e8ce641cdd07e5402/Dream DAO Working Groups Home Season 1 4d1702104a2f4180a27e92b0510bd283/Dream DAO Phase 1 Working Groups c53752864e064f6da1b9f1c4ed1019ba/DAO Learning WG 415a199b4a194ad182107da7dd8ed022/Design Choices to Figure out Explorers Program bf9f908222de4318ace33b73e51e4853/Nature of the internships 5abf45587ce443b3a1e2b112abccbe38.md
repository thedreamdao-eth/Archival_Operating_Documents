# Nature of the internships

Tentative thoughts as a group (led by Gary): → in summer - 2.5 months?

→ explorer gets to “own” a tangible set of key results that they spend the summer driving to achieving
→ web3 x social impact related (need to flesh out criteria)
→ Does this have to do with the independent research question?
   Ideally
Asynchronous Thoughts/Ideas: Madison: Need to make sure the internships are meaningful  + Ale - aligned with their goals and interests, ideally they own a specific project, product, feature or research of the organization
Madhav: How do we incentivize the explorers to feel more engaged and appreciated ?—Ale: the mentor ensures this + a bi-weekly call with 4-5 explorers and a DreamDAO member to share experiences, questions, etc about internship
