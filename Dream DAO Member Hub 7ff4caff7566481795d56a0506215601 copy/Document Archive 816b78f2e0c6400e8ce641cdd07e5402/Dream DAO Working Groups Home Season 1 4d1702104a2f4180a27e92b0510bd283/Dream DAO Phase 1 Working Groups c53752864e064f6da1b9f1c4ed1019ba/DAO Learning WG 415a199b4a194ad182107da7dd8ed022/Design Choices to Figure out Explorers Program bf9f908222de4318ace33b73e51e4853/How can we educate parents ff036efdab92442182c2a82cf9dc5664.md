# How can we educate parents?

Tentative thoughts as a group (led by Gary): They may be confused about web3
Asynchronous Thoughts/Ideas: Ethan: Send the Dream DAO one-pager and maybe host a parent info session if there’s enough demand? We can also create an “Intro to Web3” resource or direct them to existing ones from OdysseyDAO or CCS. +1 -Madison +1 Ale definitely parent info session where parents can see the actual faces of us, champions, etc instead of NFT representations they would not understand.
