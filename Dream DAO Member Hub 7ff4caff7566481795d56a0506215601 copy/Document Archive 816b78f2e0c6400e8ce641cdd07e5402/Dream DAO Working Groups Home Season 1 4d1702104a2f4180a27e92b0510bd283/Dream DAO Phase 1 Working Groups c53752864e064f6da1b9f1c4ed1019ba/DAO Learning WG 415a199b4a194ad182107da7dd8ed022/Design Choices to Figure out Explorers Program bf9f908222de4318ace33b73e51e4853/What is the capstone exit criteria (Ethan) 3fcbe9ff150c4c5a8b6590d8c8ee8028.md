# What is the capstone/exit criteria? (Ethan)

Tentative thoughts as a group (led by Gary): → How can we make sure that the explorers are learning?

→ Should there be requirements surrounding explorers to prove their learning?

Madison: I think they should be able to create a capstone that answers the question they entered the program with. It could also be cool to let them pick what type of capstone (research paper, video, presentation, etc)  +2 Ale,Madhav
