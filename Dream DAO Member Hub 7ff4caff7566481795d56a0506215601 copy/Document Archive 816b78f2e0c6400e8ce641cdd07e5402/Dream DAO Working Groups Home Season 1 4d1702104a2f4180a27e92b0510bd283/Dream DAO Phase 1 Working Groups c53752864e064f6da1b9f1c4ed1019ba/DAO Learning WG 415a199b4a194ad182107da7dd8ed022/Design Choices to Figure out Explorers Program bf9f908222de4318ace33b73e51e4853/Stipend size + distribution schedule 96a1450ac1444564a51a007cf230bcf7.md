# Stipend size + distribution schedule

Tentative thoughts as a group (led by Gary): → How do the internship host sites help fund the Explorers program?
    → Donating to the Dream DAO?

→ Who else is funding the Explorers program?

→ The stipend must be good enough to justify working nearly full time during summer

Laws around crypto payment (and other payment) should be looked into
Asynchronous Thoughts/Ideas: Ethan: Personally, I think stipend is more of a luxury than a necessity. I would wait off until after we get the initial cohort and have a sense of the budget before setting a size. 

Madison: I think it needs to be at least 1k to make the program accessible for people who would otherwise need to be working during the summer for personal financial reasons. If that is not possible, maybe it is need-based? Like people request funding? 

Ale: Definitely agree on stipend, even with passion it is often that students specially those on financial aid  do need the stipend. I wonder though if this can be covered by partner org in some extend or we can do some maths around the cost of the course vs stipend for internship, maybe there is a solution by playing around these?
Madhav : Stipends I think would be a good way to show appreciation that people do care that they are doing something good. Appreciation means a lot .
