# How mentors fit in

Tentative thoughts as a group (led by Gary): → 1:1 mentorship

→ We’d probably open up mentorship applications to beyond our Champion community?
    → Depends on what the role of the mentor is

→ should the mentor be someone related to the internship host site?

→ is there multiple mentors?
Asynchronous Thoughts/Ideas: Madison: I think people should be able to reach out to their dream mentor. Also, should prob meet weekly if the program is 3 months since so much will be going on. Otherwise, bi-weekly would be good +1 Madhav

I like the idea of mentors within DreamDAO and also making sure the Explorer has a point person in the internship that they can reach out to in a mentor capacity to guide the experience as one that is fulfilling. Champion mentorship remains throughout the program. Ale
