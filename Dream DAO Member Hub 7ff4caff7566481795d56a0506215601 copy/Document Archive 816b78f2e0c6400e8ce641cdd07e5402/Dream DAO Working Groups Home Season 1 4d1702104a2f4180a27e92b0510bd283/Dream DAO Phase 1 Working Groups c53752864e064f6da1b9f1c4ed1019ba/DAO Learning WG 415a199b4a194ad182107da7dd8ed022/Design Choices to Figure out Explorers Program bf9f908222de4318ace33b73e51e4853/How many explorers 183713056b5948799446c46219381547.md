# How many explorers?

Tentative thoughts as a group (led by Gary): 10-15 - need to keep it small so we get it right (and know what to refine + automate in future)
Asynchronous Thoughts/Ideas: I think 10 would be a good number because it could help them form strong bonds as Dunbar's number comes into play  - Madhav

Ethan: I think this comes with interest as well. We have a lot of builders, and if the builders are all dedicated + have the bandwidth, I see no reason to reject them. +1 -Madison +1 Ale I think even 20-25 builders could make a super-strong cohort
