# Relationship to rest of DAO learning

Tentative thoughts as a group (led by Gary): Way more hands on learning (project building)

More independent learning: maybe each Explorer needs to do a DEEP dive on a question that the web3 world should have insight into.
→ a default question could be: what is one problem not being solved in social impact world; and how could web3 support it? (and questions like this)

→ Build weekends?
    → this is a great idea!

→ Small Juntos

Asynchronous Thoughts/Ideas: Maybe the explorers could host a session based on the insight they had or a project they are building - Madhav +1 -Madison
Ale: This space is so early there is still so much opportunity for explorers to learn and create valuable content just like Kernel guild tracks evolve and grow over time
