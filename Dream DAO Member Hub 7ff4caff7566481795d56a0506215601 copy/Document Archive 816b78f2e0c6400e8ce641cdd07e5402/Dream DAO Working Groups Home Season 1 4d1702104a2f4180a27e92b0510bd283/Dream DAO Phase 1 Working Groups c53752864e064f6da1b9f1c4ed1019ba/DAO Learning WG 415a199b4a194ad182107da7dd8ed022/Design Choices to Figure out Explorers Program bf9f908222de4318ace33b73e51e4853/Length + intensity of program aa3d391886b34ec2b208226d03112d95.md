# Length + intensity of program

Tentative thoughts as a group (led by Gary): initially thought 6 months might be good, but might be too long especially since we need more time to plan the program AND we are already doing a lot of foundational learning through basic DAO operations

So maybe it’s more like 3.5 months (internship included)?
→ Beginning of May to mid August?
→ what happens before internship?
→ 2-2.5 month internship?

First phase of internship in may might be less time (7-10 hrs a week), but during internship it’s like full time work.
Asynchronous Thoughts/Ideas: Thoughts change - 6 months could show the rigour and the possibilities of the program - Madhav

Ethan: It would be good to either have a longer program or two short ones. For example, exploring for 3 months and then building something for another 3 could be a good method.

Madison: I like the idea of 3.5 months because you are completely immersed in it. I think this will allow people to get so much more out of the program because they won’t have to juggle school/extracurriculars. That said, I also think that the internship needs to come after they have learned  some. Maybe the first half of program is learning, and second half of program is internship to apply that learning.  
Ale: I like the idea of a shorter program, so people are fully focused and committed. How about learning - internship (still has sessions with DreamDAO in some way)-building. I was thinking about learning starting on the last month or 2 of the school year but would this be hard with finals?
