# Relationship + responsibilities of Explorers to rest of DAO / web3

Tentative thoughts as a group (led by Gary): → Share their research in consumable ways

→ Host recurring meetings that the rest of the DAO can come to that enable other members to hear what explorers are learning?
      → i think we should start weekly Open Jam Session - Explorers can plug into these and share some insights

→ How do non-Explorer builders relate to Explorers during the Explorers program?
      → Explorers could host Learning Together sessions?


→ How do Explorer program alumni’s roles change after they graduate?
    I think it’s a good question to ask what happens when Builders get too old PERIOD. And is the Builder role a temporary role? Do some people roll off if they are inactive? Do some people become Champions?

→ How do alumni support the next program?
     → They will give detailed feedback on what to improve
     → Some will be Explorers Program Junto Guides
     → They will share their learnings with others.
Asynchronous Thoughts/Ideas: Madison: Re: Builder role status, maybe we should do it like doctors have to do, like some action at a certain frequency to renew your license or in this case membership. Also for the role alumni play, I wonder if they should be the primary ones running the program (with the help of the rest of the DAO)
Ale: I like the idea of running the program, having a very active role on iterating and growing the topics and experiences. Although I wonder how will they be ‘rewarded’ and if we do really need like 20 people to run a program. Also they could be guides, providing workshops, meet some cool explorers. What differentiates a builder from a Champion, when do Builders become champions if commitment and value shows they should transition.
