# Before the application we need an Explorers Program One Pager For Builders (applicants)

..: what should it inform? 
answers: amanda: general info about the DDEP + expected time commitment + contributions expected from each explorer by the end of the program

I dont think we really need that because most of the buildrs applying for the program understand it and its always changing still we have quit a lot of docs on it
