‚ú® **web3 x social impact guide!**
[https://futurefoundation.notion.site/futurefoundation/Web3-x-Social-Impact-Examples-Curated-by-Future-Foundation-c47723dc60664d11b02e2cc69c91446e](https://www.notion.so/Web3-x-Social-Impact-Examples-Curated-by-Future-Foundation-c47723dc60664d11b02e2cc69c91446e?pvs=21)

</aside>

**Notes:

Objective:** 

- Saf ‚Üí making it easier to onboard people to web3 x social impact
- Gary ‚Üí establish ourselves as something of an authority in web3 x social impact
- Oliver - different ways of social impact done can introduce people to get involved/work on their own + creation of their own ideas - diverse format
- Gary ‚Üí establish a lay of the land of web3 x social impact

**Challenges right now:**

- Hard to figure out how to get involved
- Don‚Äôt even know what projects are out there
- Don‚Äôt even know where to start - who is an authority on web3 x social impact?

**Design questions:**

- How do we pick which projects we encourage people to be a part of?
    - Future Foundation - to be like a landing page for web3 x social impact curious people- and we‚Äôd ask Dave what they should do when they get in
    - Dream DAO
- Are there action items at the bottom of this guide?
    - Consider joining a DAO (that we recommend)
        - Browse a list of web3 x social impact projects on your own
    - Try out web3 x social impact protocols /services (that aren‚Äôt DAOs)
    - Link to other web3 x social impact [beginner] resources?
- Which web3 x social impact beginner resources are there? and what should we link to?
    - Are these related to resources we‚Äôve ‚Äúbattle-tested‚Äù through our [](../../../../../Evergreen%20Documents%20976d2984e99f4146b4283457a2303a7c/Evergreen%20Documents%20Database%20db1ccc6322ae474dba4b59d6b687d080/Dream%20DAO%20Learning%20Resources%2009d28d2fc90244639f0555bc8dfdb2cc/Dream%20DAO%20Open%20Library%20(w%20Reviews)%20738d91bcf871449294f962e3b59f467c/Dream%20DAO%20open%20library%20-%20resource%20list%20efd5b2b41c8847fc86ade78b2cc5b759.md) or Learning Together sessions?
- What might we want to touch on?
    - Shortcomings / gaps of the intersection
    - Successful case studies already
    - Promising new projects
    - The vision / opportunity if people invest in this intersection
    - Types of web3 x social impact projects / DAOs

**Misc notes:**

- Jason: 10 mins is a little long
    - Gary: maybe it‚Äôs like 5 mins?
- Charlotte ‚Üí more distinct compared to other projects just so there‚Äôs not a lot of repeats + people feel comfortable in terms of getting right content. Make sure we‚Äôre not repeating sources
- Jason ‚Üí can take 10 minutes or longer depending on the person‚Äôs interest
- Oliver ‚Üí having the option to dive deeper but if they‚Äôre not feeling engaged they could go to a brief introduction (they can find something exciting themselves + go from there)
- Saf ‚Üí would consider some project web3 x social impact but not necessarily DAO

## **Reflection !!**

Any takeaways? Any tips/advice for our next meeting? Best part of the call? 

- Use Zoom next time lol
- have a designated person sharing on zoom + butter (setting the expectation that there‚Äôs no mobile app)
- Working Group meetings def use Zoom - Gary
- (when writing the guide - don‚Äôt overwhelm people with the projects)
