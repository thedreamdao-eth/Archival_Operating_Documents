### 1. Internship Hosts Requirements:

*â†’ Do they need to fill out an application? All of them should buy a Skywalkerz?*

[ðŸ§ Hosts Criteria Brainstorm ](Meeting%20#5%20%E2%80%94%20Explorers%20Program%208142587289704083a6a2cbf7de990648/%F0%9F%A7%A0Hosts%20Criteria%20Brainstorm%20fcc55d15418a4291a413355f6cc312d5.csv)

### 2. How will be the researching and internship process (platforms, lectures, hackathons, workshops, etc)

*No need for now*

### 3. Explorers Selection Process Brainstorm (meritocratic/democratic selection)

Responses:

- ranked choice voting of people who submit some kind of statement about why they want to be an explorer
    - what are the guardrails related to the statement?
        - **strongly encouraged to explain why they have time for this**
            - open but with a 300 word limit.
            - what other commitments are they responsible for? (examine their bandwidth; encourage balance)
            - Consolidating opportunities is counterproductive; thereâ€™s less value sourced per opportunity since few are overloading and causing resource vacuums
- when is this statement due?
- how many people do we take?
    - 15
    - end of march
- is there a matching process after the people are selected?
- when do we need to start reaching out to internship sites?
    - what do we need to have in terms of documents to convince internship sites?
        - **one-pager for them**
        - **email outreach template**
- How connected is the candidate to the rest of the community/other builders?
    - We want their journey to also serve the larger community
- What kind of builders do we want to seeâ€” what profiles?
    - Should clarify values or expectations from the builder
