# Meeting #1 - 1/24

# *Icebreaker* ✨ (<5 mins)

Answer at least one out of two questions below - type your name for attendance!

**If you have been into Web3 for quite some time, what ‘learning’ advice would you give to yourself when you first got interested in it?**

Responses:

- Safder: Join a DAO! Easier to learn with other people. Also download Metamask and learn by doing lol (this could be a barrier as it requires spending real money).
- Jae-Hee: What Safder said 😂 And also like try to find a web3 community on twitter to follow for a consistent trickle of recent info.
- Jason: Find a community of like minded people & have skin in the game.
- Oliver: I would tell myself at the beginning of my learning to take notes on all the many branches I discover. Map it!
- Prof : Podcasts, twitter threads, medium posts, youtube videos... do not shy away from any form of content, they all hold their own value!
- Nathan Yan: Just try things out! metamask, minting nfts, defi
- Ale: Not just read but also try it out! Don't hesitate in joining conversations even if you feel you are lost on info and feel too new

Think about your Web3 learning experience, no matter how limited your knowledge be **Which type of resources and ways of learning suit you the most?**

Responses:

- Madison: When I am able to instantly apply what I learned (practice problems/discussion)
- Charlotte: Walk-throughs and tutorials where I can see something happen step by step!
- Jason: Hands on application of learnings and discussions rather than lectures.
- Jae-Hee: People! People/friends who you can learn with!
- Lucy: visually rather than virtually, then having someone watch me try it and give feedback
- Shaan: Documentation and walk-throughs for different platforms (overviews and summaries)
- Nathan: twitter threads and youtube
- Gary: twitter threads and youtube
- Prof: I love podcasts.  You can unpack so much more via a long form conversation
