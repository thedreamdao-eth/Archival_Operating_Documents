### Review Explorers Program  ‚ú®

‚Üí Let‚Äôs take a look in this timeline for the [Dream DAO Explorers Program](../../../../../Design%20Documents%20&%20Braindumps%2096c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae/Dream%20DAO%20Explorers%20Program%20-%20Design%20Doc%20(May%202022%20057b51e4dc864f68bf9fe93bf1464d2f.md): [https://www.notion.so/28bc063627414e90ac09662f0756ed44?v=14bf08fa1c8c40198b8bad6178577614](https://www.notion.so/28bc063627414e90ac09662f0756ed44?pvs=21) + [Dream DAO Explorers Program - Design Doc (May 2022 Version)](../../../../../Design%20Documents%20&%20Braindumps%2096c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae/Dream%20DAO%20Explorers%20Program%20-%20Design%20Doc%20(May%202022%20057b51e4dc864f68bf9fe93bf1464d2f.md) 

- *(also, here‚Äôs an async brainstorm we worked on last week - no worries on looking it over: [DAO Learning Timeline - Asynch Brainstorm](../DAO%20Learning%20Timeline%20-%20Asynch%20Brainstorm%208459f3b926c24ff49911f8fbd04982f6.md))*

**Notes:** 

- Madison - interest form, more of an application process. The time to complete the application needs to be the same caliber for the interest of the program. Need much more rigorous process for the form
- Saf - 20 hours a week? 40 hours a week?
- Arman: Should we have an interview alternative for people who cant write the forms extensively but feel comfortable sharing through audio or videos?
- Madison: climate fellowship application asks open ended questions and allow people to reflect on so that they can convey in the apps too. We can take some inspo from the application.
- Saf: higher effort in the application
- Amanda: Should we have a spot where they say if they‚Äôre interested in internship or research? Is it free-flowing/self guided or ?...option to do more hands on work or more research work?
- Madison: Open ended question: if there was unlimited resource, what web3 related project would you do?
- Saf: that kind of requires a lot of knowledge in web3?
- Madison: Builders at this point should have gained some knowledge in practice that they can apply to internships/etc !
- Gary: maybe creating a video answering all open ended question at once?
- Gary: main application should reflect on the builder‚Äôs experience in the DAO.
- Saf: there might be people who weren‚Äôt able to plug in the DAO but might be interested in the program
- Madison: it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to have a long application but it could hurt the number of people who are interested and the bandwith aspect
- Amanda: Long application wouldn‚Äôt hurt because the program ensures that the explorer‚Äôs will be provided opportunities such as internship etc.
- Amanda: The applicants would also be interested in working in certain field ‚Üí question about their social impact interest, what would they like to be impacting on

Asynch: Add any suggestions below: 

Selection process: 

- Madison: more rigorous - more likely they‚Äôre be interested and more align to internship host sites
- Gary: placing 10 to 15 people in the internship sites, maybe we should have not a target # of placements. At least 5 but all of them must be super excited about it and the host sites need to be high quality too (taking lead in editing the Questions)
- Madison: The application is more of an interest form. Once we get that #, Gary will be able to use that to help secure internship sites. If there‚Äôs more applicants and cannot find much internship host sites, then we will go through the voting process.
- Saf: We must make sure that these students are quality (maybe have an interview process to finalize? interview process with the host sites as well)
- Madison: 20 hours is the minimum to get a lot of value
- Amanda: Maybe there‚Äôs people who might wind up not being interested in certain aspects throughout the interview process ‚Üí maybe we could have a ‚Äò‚Äômatching‚Äô‚Äô before the interview?
- Madhav: What if there‚Äôs lack of skills? Maybe not have the technical skills to do a certain internship
- Madison: At CU, we work on some projects and there was a person who was interested in engineering and they allowed them to meet with the engineering team - the insight would be cool
- Shaan: With the partnerships, does the explorer‚Äôs have the choice to choose who they would like to be with? Or is it two-way decision
- Gary: interview process with people who are interested (two way process)

- Amanda: what is the champions role on this program? Will they mentor or?.. 
+1 Madhav
- Madison: It doesn‚Äôt feel relevant - they wouldn‚Äôt have much context
- Shaan - did a summer internship back in high school, and show up at their internship intermittedly and see what the process is like
- Gary: junto style? low bureaucracy? the explorer‚Äôs can talk about web3 etc! Really helpful for creating a close community - they can ask questions that won‚Äôt look ‚Äúdumb‚Äù to the internship host sites
- Madison: form a better connections and have a better experience
- Amanda: Junto can provide an amazing resource for capstone projects etc
- Saf: junto before the internship start - can get people excited about!
- Madison: onboarding?
- Amanda: if we are having junto, do we need guide or something?
- Shaan: brain dump experience for the explorer‚Äôs??
- Gary: ^^ default model? how frequent? every 2 weeks? it helps me remember insights - more than once a month? junto can also provide that space as well?
- Shaan: if they want to opt out of junto in specific occasion, they can attend brain dump !

- Gary: priority in the explorer‚Äôs program but can do other things

Web3/introductory guide

- Gary: we‚Äôre like the curators
- Madison: how will they be able to us the guide?
- Madhav: would be a good opportunity for the explorer‚Äôs to get a deeper insight
- Gary + Julia talking to a representative at Mirror or  to find ways to icnrease accessibility in documentation! (pay us for accessibility!) ensuring that the representative isn‚Äôt super..techy. How do we monetize that in some way?
- Madison: Making sure what we are prioritizing is relevant to the mission...
- Gary: experiment with the dream dao constituency - dream dao is the universe of what the default demographic was

next steps: 

- Madison: Gary updating the design doc + interest document - what dates do you want us to review by?
- Gary: right after give feedback on discord
- Amanda: Madison - introductory course guide, Gary - get people feedback for the interest form

Tasks: 

- **Madhav**: Introductory course guide
- **Gary**: Update 1) Interest form and 2) design doc with junto information

### Additional Discussions:

‚Üí **Gary**: Let‚Äôs brainstorm on creating a guide for the introductory courses that are so plentiful now

- Madhav start a table.
On it .

‚Üí **Gary**: Let‚Äôs brainstorm on what else this DAO wg should be doing!

- One idea: Maybe we establish an accessibility advisory service, effectively in exchange for grants? For example, NEAR is working on increasing accessibility

‚Üí **Amanda & Gary:** builders selection/ranking structure

- 

‚Üí **Amanda & Gary:** discuss on finding companies with potential research internship (in case any explorer wants to focus on researching)

-

‚Üí **Amanda & Gary:** how should the program look like since the program is now focusing more on internship and research?
