# EXPLORERS PROGRAM TIMELINE

[Dream DAO Explorers Program - Design Doc (May 2022 Version)](../../../../Design%20Documents%20&%20Braindumps%2096c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae/Dream%20DAO%20Explorers%20Program%20-%20Design%20Doc%20(May%202022%20057b51e4dc864f68bf9fe93bf1464d2f.md) 

## Application Form - Builders/Explorers

time frame: april 16 - april 27 

### to consider:

- **how will the application + selection process look like?**
    
          last meeting we talked about builders doing some kind of statement about why they want to be a explorer
    
- **what are the guardrails related to the statement?**
    
          strongly encouraged to explain why they have time for this
    
    open but with a 300 word limit.
    
    what other commitments are they responsible for? (examine their bandwidth; encourage balance)
    

**Gary created an interest form for builders: will this be the application already or do we need something else? if so, what?**
