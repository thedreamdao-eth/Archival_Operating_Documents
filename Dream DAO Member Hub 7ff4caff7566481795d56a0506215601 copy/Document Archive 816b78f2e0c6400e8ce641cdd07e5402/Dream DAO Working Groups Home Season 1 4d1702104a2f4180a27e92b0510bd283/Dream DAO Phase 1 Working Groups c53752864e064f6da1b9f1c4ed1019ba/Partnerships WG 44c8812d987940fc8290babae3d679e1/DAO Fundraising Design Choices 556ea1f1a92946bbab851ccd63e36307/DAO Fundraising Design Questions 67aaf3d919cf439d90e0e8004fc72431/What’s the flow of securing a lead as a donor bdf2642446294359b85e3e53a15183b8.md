# What’s the flow of securing a lead as a donor?

Chabu: tentative road map for leads:
→ introduced someway/how 
→ set up a 1:1 with a champion and builder? 
→ identify what parts of the dao are most compelling to them and plan a short term one off activiation (join a jam session or WG, go to a learning together, twitter spaces convo, etc.)
→ invite to a learning together 
→ brought into the discord
→ second 1:1 to ask about their experience in the dao/catch up and do a 1:1
Ethan: First they have to engage with the Dream DAO content before anything. Maybe we have a mailing list for the Dream Journal, see who has interest before sending donation outreaches.
Gary: → i think for the most part - it’s getting them to ape into a Skywalker when the time is right
→ For DAOs like Gitcoin DAO, I think we can ask for grants
