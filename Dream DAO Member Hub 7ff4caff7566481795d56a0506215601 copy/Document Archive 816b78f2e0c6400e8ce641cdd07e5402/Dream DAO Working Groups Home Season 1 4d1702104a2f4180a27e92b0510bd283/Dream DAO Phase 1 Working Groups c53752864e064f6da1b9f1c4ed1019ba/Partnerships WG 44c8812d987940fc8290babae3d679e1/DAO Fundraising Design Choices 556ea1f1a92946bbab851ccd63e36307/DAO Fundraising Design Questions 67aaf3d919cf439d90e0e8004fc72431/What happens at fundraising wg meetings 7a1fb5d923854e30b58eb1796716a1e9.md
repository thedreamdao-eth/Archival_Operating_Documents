# What happens at fundraising wg meetings?

Ash Kranti: Updates, mostly - brainstorming should probably happen in the channel since everyone has conflicting schedules.

Keep meetings to a minimum - everyone’s busy and most of Dream DAO’s work is async.
Chabu: → ID 3 month objectives and weekly practices/tasks that correlate 
→ weekly check-ins and upates 
→ update CRM and fund tracking 
Gary: Brainstorming + updates
Prof: Brainstorming, as we start to raise more we need some metrics to understand where we are being successful and how its being driven / is it sustainable
