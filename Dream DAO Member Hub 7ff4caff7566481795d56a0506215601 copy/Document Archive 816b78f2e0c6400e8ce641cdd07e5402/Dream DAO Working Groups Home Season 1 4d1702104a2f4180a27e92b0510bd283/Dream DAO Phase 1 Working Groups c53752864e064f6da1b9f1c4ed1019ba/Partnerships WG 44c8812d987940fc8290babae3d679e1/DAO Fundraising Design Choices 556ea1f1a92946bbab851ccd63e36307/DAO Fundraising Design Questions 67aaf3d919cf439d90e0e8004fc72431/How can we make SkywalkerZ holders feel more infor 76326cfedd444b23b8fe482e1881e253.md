Ethan: We can have different builders give testimonials every so often (better Dream Journal) and also invite them to our events. 
Gary: I like Ash’s idea

Also - inviting them to sessions.

Julia: Offering giveaways for custom art with their SkywalkerZ, in line with Ash’s idea! 

Dream DAO zine with speculative solarpunk fiction that is distributed to them for free - they can also even be randomly featured in some of that content.

Having a SkywalkerZ-holder only discord channel.
