# How can we map our existing relationships? And how can we build a practice of adding to this map when we meet new prospects?

Chabu: → adding to the CRM system can be add to easy contributions 
→ we should have ‘relationship bounties’ aka a clear set of relationships we’re looking to build and network with 
 
Gary: We should create a CRM - like how we do for CU donor + partner relationships - this can be crossfunctional

Prof: Is there something we can do on chain?  Or is that too wild of an idea.  If you truly want to map existing relationships, just a shared spreadsheet type document with standard fields everyone can populate will be very helpful.
