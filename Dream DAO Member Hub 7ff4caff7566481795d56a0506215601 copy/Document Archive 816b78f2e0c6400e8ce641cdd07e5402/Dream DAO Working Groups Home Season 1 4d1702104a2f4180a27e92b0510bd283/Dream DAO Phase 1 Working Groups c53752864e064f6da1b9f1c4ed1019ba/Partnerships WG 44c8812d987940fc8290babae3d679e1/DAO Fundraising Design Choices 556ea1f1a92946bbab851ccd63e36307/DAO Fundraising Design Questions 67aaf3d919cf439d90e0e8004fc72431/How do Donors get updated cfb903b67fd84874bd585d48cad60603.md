# How do Donors get updated?

Ash Kranti: Something similar to the Dream journal but made by us :)
Chabu: ^see above

→ not sure about replicating the dream journal for donors. it’s a pretty lengthy format. maybe a hybrid of a twitter thread that we pin and update with community wins and a link to a dream-journal-like document 
Ethan: Beyond the Dream Journal, maybe we have spotlights on one or a couple of explorers that got something because of donations (ie. an opportunity to go to a conference, an internship)
Gary: To Ash’s point, maybe there is something like a Dream Journal except covering an entire Phase (that would blow people away)

Prof: Dream journal is a good start.  Just regular emails and communication will help

- monthly update?
    - this can supercharge fundraising power across all sources
