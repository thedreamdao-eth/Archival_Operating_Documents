# What can we pass out in-person?

Chabu: Pushing against prioritizing something to pass out in person? 

Some open questions: 
→ when would this be passed out? 
→ for in person moments/experiences how can we make new introductions stand out? I imagine a user journey where someone is introduced to a Dream DAO member, has our twitter handle, how do we make sure they go back and learn more? What’s the next step in pushing the user journey?
→ what is something that people NEED to use and don’t have on them at conferences/events? (goal is to give something that doesn’t get thrown out...I only place stickers of brands that I really like and am already committed to)  
Ethan: stickers probably most cost-effective, but also skywalkerZ plushes? alternatively, postcard-size explanation of the Dream DAO.
Julia: Agree with the stickers idea - one thing I also think we can explore is solarpunk art created by members of our community that can be printed on a wide scale though screenprint or via posters. This would be at a higher “price point” / contribution level than stickers.

Lars: agree with all the ideas → stickers would be amazing and postcard-style explainers sound really helpful
Prof: I think snappy one pagers or postcard type things would be very useful.
