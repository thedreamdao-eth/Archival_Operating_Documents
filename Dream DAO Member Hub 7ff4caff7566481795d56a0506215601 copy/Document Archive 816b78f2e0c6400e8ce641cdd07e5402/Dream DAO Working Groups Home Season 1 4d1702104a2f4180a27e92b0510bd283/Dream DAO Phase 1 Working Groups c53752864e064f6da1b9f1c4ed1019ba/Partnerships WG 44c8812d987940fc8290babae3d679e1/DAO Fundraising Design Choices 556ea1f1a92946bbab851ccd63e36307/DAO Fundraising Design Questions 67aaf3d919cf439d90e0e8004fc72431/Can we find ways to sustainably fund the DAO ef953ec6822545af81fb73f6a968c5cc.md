# Can we find ways to sustainably fund the DAO?

Ash Kranti: Are we able to apply for grants? What about partnerships? Maybe selling off 1:1 stickers?
Chabu: → Not an answer but a question - what are some great examples and models that exist?

→ Can we do something similar to UPS?

Ethan: Create SkywalkerZ utility to enable secondary transactions, set up way to donate on a reoccurring basis

Prof: Yes, many thoughts.  Enhance utility of NFT to generate more secondary sales, try to get donations of NFTs that earn.  Understand if there are Defi protocols that can help us sustainably earn on our Treasury but reduce risk.
