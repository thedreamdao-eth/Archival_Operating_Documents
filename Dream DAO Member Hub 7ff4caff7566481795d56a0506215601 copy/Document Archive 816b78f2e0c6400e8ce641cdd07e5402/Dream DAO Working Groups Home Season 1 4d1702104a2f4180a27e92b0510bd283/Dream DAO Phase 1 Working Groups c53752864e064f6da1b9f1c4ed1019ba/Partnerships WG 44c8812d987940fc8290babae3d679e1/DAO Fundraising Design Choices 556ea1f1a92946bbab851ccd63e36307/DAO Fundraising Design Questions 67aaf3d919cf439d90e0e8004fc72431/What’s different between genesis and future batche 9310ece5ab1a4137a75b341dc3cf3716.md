# What’s different between genesis and future batches of SkywalkerZ that make people excited to buy this second round?

Chabu: → I’m not sure if the distinction is something we need to think deeply about - if you’re a founding SkyWalkerZ holder - that speaks for its self. I would jam more on the second part of the question 

Ethan: Maybe treat it like a serum? Get a pet, unique characteristics, etc. with the second round. Basically, make it like an evolution of properties. 
Gary: Maybe there’s a frame around the second batch ones / Like a Phase 2 overlay.

I think they should be mostly identical though

Prof: Put some additional features and programming into them to make sure they are providing additional utility.  Perhaps genesis are the only NFTs that get airdrops or something.
