# How can we plan ahead for conferences where leads can be?

Ash Kranti: Have a lead for this.
Ethan: Have 1-2 builders go along with Gary, cold outreach?

+1 ash kranti - but where do we get funding, how do we choose who?

+1 chabu: way more compelling to meet a kid in the DAO than to tell people about kids in the DAO 
Prof: Agree have someone who is actively tracking this, but not sure if needs to ONLY sit in fundraising.  I would love someone from cirriculum etc at these conferences as well to provide good substance too

+1 ash kranti

- Different conferences have different types of people we want to meet
