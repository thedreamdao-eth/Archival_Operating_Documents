# How can we use PR blitz to excite potential donors?

Ash Kranti: videos!! animations!! solarpunk art!! (solarpunk art esp has been getting a lot of attention from folx)

reach out to connectionss, esp gary’s
Chabu: → how can we align phase milestones with a PR blitz so they are built in to be reoccurring and can focus around a specific event and narrative 
Ethan: First, we need an actionable plan for the money and milestones. Set up a donation page with all this very obviously displayed, then use the PR blitz to disseminate the Dream DAO and push them to the site. 
Julia: I feel like we should be looking at tech spaces outside web3 that are intentionally crafted and focused on tech for social good-  Reboot, etc.- and try getting written about in zines / indie publications that can encourage onboarding of new ppl to web3 who may be skeptical.

Prof: I think we need to be leveraging some things like Rug Radio.  For example, if they have specific NFT for social impact shows we should look to leverage those audiences.
