# How do we encourage repeat contributions?

Ash Kranti: Award some kind of badges or physical merch (skywalkerz plushies??), as well as public recognition.
Chabu: → relationship building and investing synchronous time to get to know donors 
→ creating an cool update system for letting our network know when we’re working on cool things (something more formal than twitter or maybe a pinned twitter thread of dream dao dubbs) 
Ethan: We can have a special role for them, or maybe we have opportunities/prizes for them?
Lars: i like the idea of upgradeable NFTs but we could also send out little packages with physical merch at a certain height of donation.

Prof: We should for sure mint either POAPs or NFTs that can but upgradeable the more is donated.
