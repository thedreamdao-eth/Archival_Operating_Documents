What can we pass out in-person?,"stickers probably most cost-effective, but also skywalkerZ plushes? alternatively, postcard-size explanation of the Dream DAO.",,,"Pushing against prioritizing something to pass out in person? 

Some open questions: 
→ when would this be passed out? 
→ for in person moments/experiences how can we make new introductions stand out? I imagine a user journey where someone is introduced to a Dream DAO member, has our twitter handle, how do we make sure they go back and learn more? What’s the next step in pushing the user journey?
→ what is something that people NEED to use and don’t have on them at conferences/events? (goal is to give something that doesn’t get thrown out...I only place stickers of brands that I really like and am already committed to)  ",,,I think snappy one pagers or postcard type things would be very useful.,agree with all the ideas → stickers would be amazing and postcard-style explainers sound really helpful,"Agree with the stickers idea - one thing I also think we can explore is solarpunk art created by members of our community that can be printed on a wide scale though screenprint or via posters. This would be at a higher “price point” / contribution level than stickers.

What are we raising money for?,"staff, activating opportunities for explorers such as sponsorships/stipends for internships, conferences, and talks (paying speakers). 

+1 chabu","→ staff (gary, and eventually working group leads)
→ events
→ stipends for explorers
→ bounties for community members

+1 chabu
+1 ash kranti",,,,,"Operations - Treasury, working groups, overall leadership; Explorer stipends; bounties!!!!!; In the future can invest in other DAOs?","staff, pay for contributions, meetups (conferences) with expenses covered","→ merit-based system of paying for contributions to the DAO 
→ funding Dream DAO representation at crypto conferences (like ETH Denver)
→ funding for builder-led ventures / startups 

+1000000 ash kranti - love this!"
Can we find ways to sustainably fund the DAO?,"Create SkywalkerZ utility to enable secondary transactions, set up way to donate on a reoccurring basis

+1 chabu","→ secondary sales from skywalkerz

+1 chabu ",Are we able to apply for grants? What about partnerships? Maybe selling off 1:1 stickers?,"→ Not an answer but a question - what are some great examples and models that exist?

→ Can we do something similar to UPS?
",,,"Yes, many thoughts.  Enhance utility of NFT to generate more secondary sales, try to get donations of NFTs that earn.  Understand if there are Defi protocols that can help us sustainably earn on our Treasury but reduce risk.",,
How do we encourage repeat contributions?,"We can have a special role for them, or maybe we have opportunities/prizes for them?",,"Award some kind of badges or physical merch (skywalkerz plushies??), as well as public recognition.","→ relationship building and investing synchronous time to get to know donors 
→ creating an cool update system for letting our network know when we’re working on cool things (something more formal than twitter or maybe a pinned twitter thread of dream dao dubbs) ",,,We should for sure mint either POAPs or NFTs that can but upgradeable the more is donated.,"i like the idea of upgradeable NFTs but we could also send out little packages with physical merch at a certain height of donation.

+1 ash kranti",
How do Donors get updated?,"Beyond the Dream Journal, maybe we have spotlights on one or a couple of explorers that got something because of donations (ie. an opportunity to go to a conference, an internship)","To Ash’s point, maybe there is something like a Dream Journal except covering an entire Phase (that would blow people away)

+1 ash kranti",Something similar to the Dream journal but made by us :),"^see above

→ not sure about replicating the dream journal for donors. it’s a pretty lengthy format. maybe a hybrid of a twitter thread that we pin and update with community wins and a link to a dream-journal-like document ",,,Dream journal is a good start.  Just regular emails and communication will help,,
How can we map our existing relationships? And how can we build a practice of adding to this map when we meet new prospects?,,"We should create a CRM - like how we do for CU donor + partner relationships - this can be crossfunctional

+1 ash kranti",,"→ adding to the CRM system can be add to easy contributions 
→ we should have ‘relationship bounties’ aka a clear set of relationships we’re looking to build and network with 
 ",,,"Is there something we can do on chain?  Or is that too wild of an idea.  If you truly want to map existing relationships, just a shared spreadsheet type document with standard fields everyone can populate will be very helpful.

+1 ash kranti",,
How can we use PR blitz to excite potential donors?,"First, we need an actionable plan for the money and milestones. Set up a donation page with all this very obviously displayed, then use the PR blitz to disseminate the Dream DAO and push them to the site. ",,"videos!! animations!! solarpunk art!! (solarpunk art esp has been getting a lot of attention from folx)

reach out to connectionss, esp gary’s","→ how can we align phase milestones with a PR blitz so they are built in to be reoccurring and can focus around a specific event and narrative ",,,"I think we need to be leveraging some things like Rug Radio.  For example, if they have specific NFT for social impact shows we should look to leverage those audiences.

+1 ash kranti",,"I feel like we should be looking at tech spaces outside web3 that are intentionally crafted and focused on tech for social good-  Reboot, etc.- and try getting written about in zines / indie publications that can encourage onboarding of new ppl to web3 who may be skeptical. 

+1 ash kranti"
What kind of collateral / content is needed to encourage donations?,"Publicly demonstrating what we do — half twitter spaces or discord learning together with someone dope, then make it private for only current donors and builders.","I’m not sure, but we have a lot to work with, including:
→ https://nutshell.dreamdao.xyz
→ https://www.notion.so/5142d24477064342b71267242f15749b?pvs=21

+1 chabu ",Check w/social media,,,,"We need to understand who our audience is.  There is Trad audience who would be similar to CU, but then there is this web3 world and we need to know how to attract both to maximize.",making social media posts that show the impact we have on people in our community and society in general?,"I think one of the things that makes web3 unique is the presence of lore in terms of content - good storytelling around SkywalkerZ is essential. One great example of this is the marketing around the crypto coven, where they created a compelling story around the community that created a mini-world in web3. 

+1 ash kranti"
How can we make SkywalkerZ holders feel more informed + excited?,"We can have different builders give testimonials every so often (better Dream Journal) and also invite them to our events. ","I like Ash’s idea

Also - inviting them to sessions.

+1 ash kranti",A newsletter or having them featured in stickers!,"re: answer to this DAO%20Fundraising%20Design%20Choices%20556ea1f1a92946bbab851ccd63e36307/DAO%20Fundraising%20Design%20Questions%2067aaf3d919cf439d90e0e8004fc72431/How%20do%20we%20encourage%20repeat%20contributions%2023484f5573bc4aeaa8afb06d7f4bd98b.md ",,,"Letting them in on the learning together sessions and other things we are doing.  Let them come along for the journey we are building.

+1 ash kranti",making them a bigger part of what we do here: inviting to sessions,"Offering giveaways for custom art with their SkywalkerZ, in line with Ash’s idea! 

Dream DAO zine with speculative solarpunk fiction that is distributed to them for free - they can also even be randomly featured in some of that content.

Having a SkywalkerZ-holder only discord channel. 

+1 ash kranti"
What’s different between genesis and future batches of SkywalkerZ that make people excited to buy this second round?,"Maybe treat it like a serum? Get a pet, unique characteristics, etc. with the second round. Basically, make it like an evolution of properties. ","Maybe there’s a frame around the second batch ones / Like a Phase 2 overlay.

I think they should be mostly identical though

+1 ash kranti",,"→ I’m not sure if the distinction is something we need to think deeply about - if you’re a founding SkyWalkerZ holder - that speaks for its self. I would jam more on the second part of the question 
",,,Put some additional features and programming into them to make sure they are providing additional utility.  Perhaps genesis are the only NFTs that get airdrops or something.,,
Coinbase: NFTs for Good?,,(I just asked our contact at Coinbase if he has alpha),,,,,That would be sick,,
How can we plan ahead for conferences where leads can be?,"Have 1-2 builders go along with Gary, cold outreach?

+1 ash kranti - but where do we get funding, how do we choose who?

+1 chabu: way more compelling to meet a kid in the DAO than to tell people about kids in the DAO ",,Have a lead for this.,,,,"Agree have someone who is actively tracking this, but not sure if needs to ONLY sit in fundraising.  I would love someone from cirriculum etc at these conferences as well to provide good substance too

+1 ash kranti",,
What’s the flow of securing a lead as a donor?,"First they have to engage with the Dream DAO content before anything. Maybe we have a mailing list for the Dream Journal, see who has interest before sending donation outreaches.","→ i think for the most part - it’s getting them to ape into a Skywalker when the time is right
→ For DAOs like Gitcoin DAO, I think we can ask for grants

+1 ash kranti",,"tentative road map for leads:
→ introduced someway/how 
→ set up a 1:1 with a champion and builder? 
→ identify what parts of the dao are most compelling to them and plan a short term one off activiation (join a jam session or WG, go to a learning together, twitter spaces convo, etc.)
→ invite to a learning together 
→ brought into the discord
→ second 1:1 to ask about their experience in the dao/catch up and do a 1:1",,,100% needs to start with the skywalkerz,,
What happens at fundraising wg meetings?,,Brainstorming + updates,"Updates, mostly - brainstorming should probably happen in the channel since everyone has conflicting schedules.

Keep meetings to a minimum - everyone’s busy and most of Dream DAO’s work is async.","→ ID 3 month objectives and weekly practices/tasks that correlate 
→ weekly check-ins and upates 
→ update CRM and fund tracking ",,,"Brainstorming, as we start to raise more we need some metrics to understand where we are being successful and how its being driven / is it sustainable",,
