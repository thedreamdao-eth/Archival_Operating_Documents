    - Once you‚Äôre in, add your name and profile picture (so we know who you are)
- Continue managing partnerships! As a working group our responsibility isn‚Äôt just scouting and onboarding partners; it‚Äôs ensuring that our partners are intentionally chosen and we are working well together.
- Discuss some new ideas and whether they would be valuable

## Discussion and Project Creation

- Season Sponsors: Would it work? Likely to happen? Worth pursuing? How?
    - If we identify someone who wants us to give us money mid season, what should we do?
    - Kevin: we should always take the money if it is offered (even in the middle of the season). Part of it is that they only get what is available. Discount after time ‚Äî¬†if it‚Äôs a month in or something we can alter it.
    - Gary: Seasons are tentatively six months, whenever we are ready.
    - Kevin: Sponsor can prorate, or maybe they don‚Äôt even act as a season sponsor?
    - Gary: Celo and Coinbase both going to sponsor.
    - Kevin + Gary: steady state of seasons, maybe roll out then?
    - Kevin: maybe less of time-based sponsorship and more about other tangibles?
    - Ethan: a la carte sponsorships ‚Äî¬†explorer program, learning together, travel opps, etc. etc.
        - Gary and Kevin: Good idea, figure out a la carte things that they can sponsor.
    - Kevin: maybe we can do a trait in a future NFT drop?
    - Kevin: Did we ask the broader audience for what can be a sponsorship?
- Do we need branding/marketing? If so, is that the task for our working group or where should we delegate?
    - Ethan: more of a protocol thing, maybe a section for the partners on the website.
    - Kevin: Want to give partners a glimpse of what they‚Äôd get. Sponsorship one-pager/in-a-nutshell
        - Conferencers make these things for different sponsors, we should do this to have a stable offering for potential partners.
    - Gary: Have partnerships take charge on shirts, etc. (maybe reach out to twitter people and other partners)
        - Kevin + Gary: flexible budget for swag, we think we‚Äôre getting WAY more back
- Does anyone want to have partnership calls or be on partnership calls?
    - Requires time, flexibility, research.
    - Kevin and Ethan both want to join in on partnerships
        - Ash is also in :)
- What role should we play in terms of Explorer Program Partnerships?
    - Is this something we should be involved in or should we leave it to DAO Learning?
    - How can we maintain good relationships between us and partners or anticipate conflict resolutions between us.
    - Gary: currently the chief point person for managing the explorers program partners
        - As a wg we should check in with partners at least half way and at the conclusion
    - Gary: we need to make sure that there is relationship calls with site hosts. make sure interns are doing good work, value going both ways.
        - Should we delegate check-ins? Maybe we have a set list of questions to ensure that everything is going smoothly?
        - Gary: could be gary or madison, and someone else?
        - Kevin: goal is to share feedback, wouldn‚Äôt necessarily need to be Gary to be the one hosting the call
    - Kevin: getting explorer programs to become sponsor partners? How can we convert them?
        - Potentially after the program if they had a good experience
        - ‚ÄúOur goal is for you have a great experience in the program, and we can work with them further in other avenues‚Äù
    - Gary: For the partner to be a Dream DAO partnership, they need an official spot for our builders
- Ash: How can we have more low-commitment partnerships?
    - Gary: We need to define what Ash did. Basically, organic partnerships?
    - Ash: Vibes were good so we pursued the partnership, make sure that whatever we‚Äôre doing is organic
    - Ethan and Ash: we should have a callout in the DAO when we have DAO support for the outreach but organic in the interest
- **Ash: What happens if a partner does something that is questionable or bad that we want to cut ties or things like that. What are we gonna do if partners are not aligned with our values?**
    - Kevin: We should publicly choose our values that we advertise, which we can then leverage in the event of a partnerships.
    - Ash: Kind of like when we sign a thing in a contract that tells us when the contract is null.
