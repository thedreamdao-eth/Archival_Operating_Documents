[Dream DAO CRM](../../../../Evergreen%20Documents%20976d2984e99f4146b4283457a2303a7c/Evergreen%20Documents%20Database%20db1ccc6322ae474dba4b59d6b687d080/Dream%20DAO%20CRM%20e9bf94ac988e4a09ac50842af02e63cf/Dream%20DAO%20CRM%207340609ec50e4d7a9b3aa35d45be0453.csv)

- How effective has this been?
    - We have been pretty effective with adding people to the CRM. Over 90 contacts
- **How do we make this more useful?**
    - Potentially having Charlotte beta testing?
    - We should start acting on the CRM and the Last Contact

## Next Steps Toward Dream DAO Partnerships (25 mins)

Key pipeline ideas:

- Ideation of a partnerships design doc that makes it easy to document partner flow
    - How can we lower the barrier of entry for potential partners? Nobody wants to fill out a dozen forms before they partner
        - Big ‚Äúopen evening‚Äù every so often that could get people to engage with DD (like a social event)
        - Reducing the forms to one short one; could connect with a builder to walk through the form synchronously if they want
- Creation of a builder/organization spotlight for the Explorers Program

Other ideas, questions, and topics to discuss:

- Coming up with the ways people can plug in.
    - We need to make this most transparent ‚Äî¬†we are too often asked this question, so this process needs to become an SoP
- Joining Doing Gud‚Äôs cohort to build a network of great web3 orgs to work at and potentially get funding or opps.

## Questions about Partnerships or Dream DAO (5 mins)

## Action Items (5 mins)

- Action Items:
    - Carl to find information on the possible talks to give at DevCon (Schelling Point and Sustainable Blockchain Summit)
    - Ethan to tackle SoPs for Potential Partners and onboarding process; also, making sure it is accessible to anyone who might promote DD
    - Ethan, Madison, Carl, etc. doing DD stuff
    - Rebeca add her contacts in the CRM
    - Open bounties ‚Äî¬†grant research and applications!
