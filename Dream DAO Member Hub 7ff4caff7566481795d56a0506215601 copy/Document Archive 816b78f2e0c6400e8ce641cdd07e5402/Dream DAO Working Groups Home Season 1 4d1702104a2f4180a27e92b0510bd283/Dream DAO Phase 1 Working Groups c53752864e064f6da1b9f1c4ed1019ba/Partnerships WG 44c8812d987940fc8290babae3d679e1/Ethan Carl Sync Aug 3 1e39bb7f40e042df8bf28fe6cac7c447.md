Donor Flow: How do we make clear what we provide to other orgs?

- For funding: Typically, there will someone to sell the partnership and someone to certify it
    - Maybe look at the slides from last week to give us better visibility on what DD does and add what we need as support (tailor it to the partner, though)

The slides:

- Keep the vision, why we’re here
- letting people join LTs

Next steps: learning together, joining the discord, first person to reach out should determine what kind of partnership this is heading toward. How to get in touch with these people

some people would want to learn more, while others wouldn’t be as interested. 

Role playing in terms of how to pitch — dedicaitng a sesh to that
