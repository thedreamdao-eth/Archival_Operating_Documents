# Dream DAO Builder Testimonials Design

**Objectives:**

- Collect testimonials from Builders in multiple mediums.
- Show the impact and story behind Dream DAO.
- Feature the cool stuff/accomplishments of everyone in a *concise* way

**Project Steps:**

1. Paperform Survey
    - We ask Builders to fill out a survey indicating their preference between interview or written form testimonials.
        - Add a preface about what these will be used for and encouraging them to do it
        - POAP?
2. Gather Testimonials
    - Interview - Ash will schedule ~15 mins recorded Zoom meeting with them, all they have to do is indicate their timezone
        - What questions do we want to ask?
    - Written - design questions and talk over them with Julia, Ethan, Gary, Madison
3. Publish Results
    - Maybe publish some features on Twitter? [See TKS](https://twitter.com/theksociety) for inspiration on how they feature their students
    - Make a Notion doc, possibly called the “wall of love” that has everyone talking about what we learned
