# Season 2 Objectives and Key Results

<aside>
üí° For Season 2, the Partnerships WG wants to be more actionable and tangible with our goals.

Using the OKR Framework, we‚Äôve decided on a few key objectives and a few supplemental objectives. We‚Äôve also decided on some key results that provides incremental steps toward the larger objectives.

Everything is ranked in order of urgency/chronology. As you scroll down, the objectives get less important and the key results are completed after the ones above.

## Core Goals (Need to Have)

1. Secure 20 (paid) internship spots with web3 orgs
    1. Regular conversations about hiring and internships with X values-aligned orgs
    2. Create form for builders to indicate preferences and prepare profile that be shared with partners
    3. Create (internal) jobs board
2. Raise $X in grants from web3 orgs
    1. Present revenue goal and progress to governance
    2. Create proposal assets and collateral
3. Build X brand partnerships that grow Dream DAO presence
    1. X speaking opportunities
    2. X% of Season 1 internships host want intern(s) from Season 2

### Objective: Find web3 work opportunities for our Builders!

- Key Result 1: Find enough value-aligned organizations to provide X paid internship to Dream DAO builders.
    - Reasoning: Finding these organizations are essential to maintaining/expanding the Dream DAO Explorer Program, since we need places to give builders employment.
- Key Result 2: Work with relevant people/WGs in the DAO to build a database of potential explorers.
    - Reasoning: By understanding what our builders are capable of and what they are looking for in a work opportunity, we can target organizations that are a better fit.

### Objective: Establish brand partnerships that grow our Dream DAO social presence.

- Key Result 1: Secure 10+ speaking opportunities for builders and/or champions at conferences
    - Reasoning: Speaking opportunities allow builders to establish their personal brand in the web3 space while also promoting Dream DAO‚Äôs brand.
- Key Result 2: Generate a NPS ([Net Promoter Score](https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/customer/net-promoter-score/)) of at least 8 through a partnership health survey sent to organizational partners.
    - Reasoning: Ensuring that partners are satisfied with our relationship is essential to the success of our working group and DAO as a whole. However, we cannot complete this key result unless we have a sufficient partner network to give us feedback.
- Key Result 3: Partner with 5 ****NFT collections to secure free NFTs for builders in our community.
    - Reasoning: Interfacing with other communities (like NFT communities) gives our builders access to a more diverse group of people in web3 while also promoting our brand. I‚Äôd argue that this would be more of a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù key result, since failure to complete this wouldn‚Äôt hurt our community too much.

### **Objective: Find enough funds to sustain Dream DAO through Season 3 and beyond.**

- Key Result 1: Work with Governance and the Dream DAO Council to create a treasury system and establish a long-term budget projection.
    - Reasoning: It‚Äôs necessary to establish a numeric goal for funding to ballpark what we need. This would also be helpful for long-term DAO strategy, since we need to know what we can expand upon with what funds we have.
- Key Result 2: Conduct an audit of what avenues of funding to pursue. We can consider tokenization, grants, investors or corporate donors, etc.
    - Reasoning: We are in a unique position where we are a web3 branch of a larger web2 organization. Also, we are a non-profit DAO. These small nuances could play a role in what types of funding we seek.
- Key Result 3: Find at at least $50k in funding to sustain Dream DAO Season 3 and other DAO-related projects.
    - Reasoning: As a DAO, we are always trying to get better. To grow, we‚Äôll need more funds to deploy into new projects and ideas that help our mission. $50k seems like a reasonable goal for giving us some security.

## Supplemental Goals (Nice to Have)

### Objective: Promote a greater emphasis on partnerships across the DAO

- Key Result 1: Give greater transparency to our DAO partnerships/relationships
    - Reasoning: The first step toward emphasis is awareness. We need the DAO at large to understand what‚Äôs happening within the working group and where we‚Äôve done outreach.
- Key Result 2: Create a non-hierarchical system of outreach that incentivizes community members to find leads.
    - Reasoning: Centralizing partnerships around a few key people (stewards, WG lead, etc.) prevents us from actualizing our web3 values. Creating a system to best decentralize this process would be essential to growth.
