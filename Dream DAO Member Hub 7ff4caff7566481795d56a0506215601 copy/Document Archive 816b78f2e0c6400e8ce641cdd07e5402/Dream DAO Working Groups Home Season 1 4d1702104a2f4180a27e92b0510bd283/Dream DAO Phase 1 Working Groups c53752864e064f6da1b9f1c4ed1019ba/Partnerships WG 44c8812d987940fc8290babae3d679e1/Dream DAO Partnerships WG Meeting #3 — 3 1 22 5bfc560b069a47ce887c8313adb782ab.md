# Dream DAO Partnerships WG Meeting #3 ‚Äî¬†3/1/22

Welcome to our third meeting! Thanks for coming and let‚Äôs get started. üöÄ

## Icebreakers! üßäüî®¬†(5 mins>)

Introduce yourself! Add your name and a book you liked recently

- Ethan Wei: The Design of Everyday Things ‚Äî¬†Don Gorman
- Gary: Starting to read a book on modern history of China
- Kevin Shane: My First Summer in the Sierra by John Muir
- Tom Segal: Started re-reading Moneyball over the weekend cuz I saw it lying around. A classic for me.
- Ash Kranti: Trust by Pete Buttigieg - what an insightful take
- Chabu Kapumba: the heartbreaking work of a staggering genius

## Review Key Results for Phase 1 (5 mins)

Stage 1: Ideation

- Create a fundraising strategy: *we‚Äôve pivoted from this, moving more towards a donor archetype and informal toolkit*
    - Shared narrative + guide for how to approach people: *Ethan and Chabu working on a fundraising flowchart, Julia and Ash creating a toolkit.*
    - Identify funding sources: *Need a project lead ‚Äî¬†we‚Äôre still pretty vague about this.*
        - Gary: Great call from Coinbase Philanthropy, wants us to pitch a grant
            - Gary: organic is SkywalkerZ, institutional is more for organized efforts. As a collective, we should spend more of our efforts there. Uniswap (Ken) is possibly a lead for us to get some funds through their grants program
            - Kevin: All of the banks that are getting into Crypto right now might be good leads
            - Chabu: CU-niverse has possible leads in bank + crypto. Maybe have something promotional about SkywalkerZ? For example, expanding SkywalkerZ
            - Thomas: Happens in tandem; different channels of getting funds through institutional funds but during the process, talking to people
            - Gary: 10% of skywalkerZ secondary going back into DAO
        - Tom: 1 of 1s SkywalkerZ; what‚Äôs the deal with that?
            - Gary: cool idea to pursue, maybe we partner with Coinbase for 1 of 1 SkywalkerZ?
        - Kevin: there will be foundations trying to impact either in civics or mabye more tech-oriented
    - Choosing Fundraising Platforms: *Need a project lead ‚Äî¬†narrow down what we‚Äôll use for donations using other DAOs/initiatives for inspiration.*

Stage 2: Execution (possible timeline?)

- Secure $150,000 in new funding for the Dream DAO: *Gary to lead breakdown of cost projections*
    - Reaching out to prospects
    - Building CRM and Outreach Team
    - Progress Checks (and maybe incentives?)

### Progress Check (5 mins)

- Action Items
    
    Julia and Ash: Fundraising Toolkit
    
    - Talk to Champions and develop a ‚Äúfundraising toolkit‚Äù for them (what do the people reaching out need to attract more donors).
    
    Ethan and Chabu: Ways to plug in table including the cheatsheet Gary talked about. 
    
    Chabu: CRM process first draft
    
    Josh and Chabu: Next fundraising meeting with Thanasi, going over the CU and DD relationship in terms of donation. 
    
    - General direction: operationalizing through self-sustaining Dream DAO rather than CU funds going towards Dream DAO unless explicitly stated
- Reflections:
    - Ash: find a time that is available for more people (champions specifically)
    - Julia: is there a way to get information on how the SkywalkerZ launch went? What was the approach we took, what have we learned, etc. (Gary and Julia retrospective meeting on SkywalkerZ postmortem)

## Idea Refining/Thoughts (30 mins)

**First of all, any questions or discussion topics?**

**Meta:**

- Talk about champions engagement, best way to reach them
    - Tom: Question he encounters the most is around the actual work that the fellows (builders) will be doing. Can we get content on the builders? People want to fund people not a vague organization.
    - Ash: Good feedback. Popular sentiment that we want to focus on the builders
    - Tom: Maybe talk about the alumni of CU as well?
        - Ash: push social-media wg to collaborate with us on materials for builder content]
        - Kevin: +1 on that idea
    - Gary: have a highlight reel of faces (here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve learned, how we feel, etc.)
    - Tom: early days there was a lot of pushback on web3 by builders, how have they changed
    - Gary: talk about how this is the key to solving entrenched problems, need to spread awareness
    - Tom: this is an opportunity to promote the positives of web3
    - Kevin: Does CU or Dream DAO guide builders towards specific projects?
        - Gary: Dream ‚ÄúLab‚Äù where the community will come up with public goods that need to be built, partnering with organizations to inform and co-build a project (maybe they donate to DD in return).
        - Gary: Explorer‚Äôs program is also coming along. It‚Äôs as simple as we match some of our most committed builders with meaningful web3 x social impact orgs to come up with a project, learnings, etc.
        - Gary: web3 learning is mostly through building and experience, not really just the content consumption
        - Gary: The idea is a talent pipeline to activate talent to web3 x social impact, create learning in public opportunities
        - Ash: good idea to have less ‚Äúclassroom‚Äù time, since there‚Äôs a lot more to be learned when you DO things rather than learn.
        - Gary: Even though web3 is less diverse, the people (who we work with) aren‚Äôt closed
        - Gary: research firms internships is also a possible avenue for the program
    - Ash: work with explorers program wg to set up the deliverables and advertising those
        - Tom: integrate vlogs, other content possibilities (learning artifacts)
        - Tom: possible feature of Dream DAO is a library of builder artifacts; showcase builder progress and work
    - Chabu: find a way to advertise our learnings and what‚Äôs happening through twitter
        - Gary: use clarity teams to make this a better CRM (wallet-gated). Talk to Shaan
        - US dollar donation link for Dream DAO: [https://givebutter.com/dreamdao](https://givebutter.com/dreamdao)
- What is our opinion on WG leads? One champion + builder?
- Macro-timeline: when should what be done?
- Meeting frequency/structure feedback

**Fundraising-Specific:**

- What platform(s) will we use to accept donations? Any ideas from other DAOs?
    - Kevin: can Dream DAO accept direct donations? tax-deductible?
        - Gary: Go through Giving Block and transfer that to Dream DAO
- Idea: don‚Äôt label as donations, but instead a buy-in to the community?
    - Gary: Tell people to join the Dream DAO, buy-in, etc. and not as much a donation
    - Tom: Investing in the Dream DAO, not donating
- How do we gradually split from CU and manage our own finances?
    - Team: something to revisit later; for now, it‚Äôs more of a partnership and not a reliance
- Any new observations about what we‚Äôll need money for?
    - Gary: working group leads, gary‚Äôs role as a steward, persistent tasks people
    - Gary: March we should have elections and determining value for roles
    - Tom: How do we forsee timing and compensation for these roles
        - Gary: DAO should figure out what DAO payrolls go and what they‚Äôve done
        - Gary: bounty of DAO HR payroll equipment
    - Gary: proposal of conference travel, funds appropriate
