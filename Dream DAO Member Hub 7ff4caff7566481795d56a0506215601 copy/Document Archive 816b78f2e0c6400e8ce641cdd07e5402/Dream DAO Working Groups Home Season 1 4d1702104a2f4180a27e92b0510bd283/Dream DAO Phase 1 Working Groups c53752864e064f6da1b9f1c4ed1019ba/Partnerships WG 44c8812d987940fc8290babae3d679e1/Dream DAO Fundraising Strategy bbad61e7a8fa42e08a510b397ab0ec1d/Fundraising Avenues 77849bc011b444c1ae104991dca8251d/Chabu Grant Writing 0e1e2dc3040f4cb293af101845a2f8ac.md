# Chabu: Grant Writing

Contributor(s): Chabu Kapumba, Ethan Wei
Design Questions: → Are there enough grants available? What would be the breakdown between finding and applying?
Plan: → Commit to applying for a certain number of grants per month 
→ create a template for typical grant questions to cut down on time 
→ async feedback on grants within the wg 
Risks/Downsides: → heavy time commitment
