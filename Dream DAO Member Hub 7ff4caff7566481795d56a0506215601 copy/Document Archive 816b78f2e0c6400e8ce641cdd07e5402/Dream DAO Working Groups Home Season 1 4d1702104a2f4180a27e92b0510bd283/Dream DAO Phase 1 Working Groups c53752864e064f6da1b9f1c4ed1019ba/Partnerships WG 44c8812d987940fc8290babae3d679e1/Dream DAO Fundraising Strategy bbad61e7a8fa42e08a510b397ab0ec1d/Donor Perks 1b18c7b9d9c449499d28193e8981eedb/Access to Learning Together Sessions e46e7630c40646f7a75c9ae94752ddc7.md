# Access to Learning Together Sessions

Contributor(s): Ethan Wei
Design Questions: → Will they get a +1 invitation (donors inviting non-donors)?
Details (What is it?): Donors are invited to our learning together sessions.
How much effort/time?: Nothing donor-specific. We still have to get people to host sessions, but that’s a general time cost.
