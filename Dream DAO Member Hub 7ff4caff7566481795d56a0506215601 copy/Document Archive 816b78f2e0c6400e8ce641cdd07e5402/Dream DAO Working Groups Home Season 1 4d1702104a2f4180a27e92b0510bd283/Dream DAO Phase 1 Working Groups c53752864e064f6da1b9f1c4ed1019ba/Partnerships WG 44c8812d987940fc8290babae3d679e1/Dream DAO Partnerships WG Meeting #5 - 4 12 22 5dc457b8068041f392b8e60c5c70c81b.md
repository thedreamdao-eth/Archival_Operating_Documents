## What‚Äôs Happening In Partnerships?

Working Group Updates: 

- We have pivoted as a working group! Our new core responsibilities include...
    - Finding and building relationships with DAO partners
        - What does it mean to effectively build relationships with other orgs? What are the end goals, deliverables, metrics, etc?
    - Applying to Grants
    - Leading fundraising through individual donors
    - Chabu: Great to map out KPIs in each responsibility
        - Good to have recurrent tasks to fulfill KPIs without needing to attend every meeting
    - Thessy: Interesting to work on the overall concept of partner incentivization
    - Kevin: let‚Äôs see where this takes us and whether we need to iterate in the future

## Wrapping Up Existing Projects

- Key Point: staying intentional with future projects and ensuring that they are...
    - Chabu: important to have a priority list for the DAO, think about what we are tackling with a project and making sure that it aligns with the overarching priorities of the DAO (2-3 things)
    - Gary: Eisenhower matrix ‚Äî simple heuristic for urgent goals that need working towards, so we want to make sure that the tasks are pushing us toward the seasonal KPIs
        - You might be allowed to do things that are helpful to the DAO but aren‚Äôt pertinent to current goals, but that isn‚Äôt pay-able work
        - Working group coordinator abt we need to make sure to be mindful of what tasks we tackle.
- Existing Projects:
    - Fundraising Toolkit?
        - Tasks need to be scoped out beyond just a name. **Invite someone to collect builder testimonials; make specific**
        - Practically speaking: we have future fund answers to reuse for different times
    - CRM?
        - Needs to be like a twitter list and then a simple spreadsheet of different dreamdao relationships
        - Kevin: does CU send out newsletter
        - We need to establish a goal surrounding our communication. Kevin: how are we currently communicating with our partners?
            - ie. for big events, how will we contact people? beyond twitter, what can we do to manage relationships?
            - accountability for the minimalist crm
    - Builder Hub?
        - Feel proud of saying ‚Äúnevermind‚Äù when you propose something non-urgent or important
    - Emergent Ventures Proposal?
        - Waiting on finalized budget to tailor answers further, but draft completed
        - Gary: season 2 budget is 80-90% there; for any grant we need to guess a ballpark budget

## Other Discussion Prompts and Potential Next Steps

- As a working group, how can we stay active and helpful?
- Has anyone seen any opportunities they want to discuss (funding, DAO relationships, etc.)?
- Gary: Ethereum foundation trying to get funding, see how much we can get. Coinbase min is $100k but we‚Äôre in further discussion (internal miscommunication with how much).
    - Shout out Julia for NEAR partnerships
- Gary: more jam sessions for different proposals for platform for the DAO (being bribed)
    - We probably take the most ‚Äúno strings attached‚Äù funding on a platform and decide later on
    - Harmony, NEAR, Ethereum, etc. want people to use their platform
    - Bullish on this wg, most important is ensuring consistent progress
- Kevin: banks with interest getting into crypto might be a potential sponsor for DD
    - Pitch is filtering Dream DAO funding through CU
    - Gary pitching, interesting idea?
