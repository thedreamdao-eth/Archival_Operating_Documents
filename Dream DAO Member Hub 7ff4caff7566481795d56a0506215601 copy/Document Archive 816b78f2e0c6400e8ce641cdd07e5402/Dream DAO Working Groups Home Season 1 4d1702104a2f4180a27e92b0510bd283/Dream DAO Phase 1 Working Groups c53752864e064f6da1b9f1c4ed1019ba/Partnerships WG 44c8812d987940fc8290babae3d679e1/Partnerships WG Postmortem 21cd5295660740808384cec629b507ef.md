# Partnerships WG Postmortem

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Web3 can quickly become an echo-chamber of similar beliefs. This is even more prevalent in a small working group, where we all think weâ€™re doing so much even when our impact is greatly overestimated. As the Partnerships WG Lead, I needed to objectively look at our productivity in Season 1, and seeing how we can improve in the future.

# Successes:

## Tangibles

- Created an extensive grant application, defining who we are and setting the basis for future applications and partnerships
- $X of money allocated for Season 2 through partnerships
- Establishment of NEAR Education Group and stipend for Season 2
- Launch of Dream DAO Explorer Program through partnerships with web3 organizations

### Shoutouts/Acknowledgements:

- To Gary Sheng for being the mitochondria of this working group. Juggling DAO marketing, partnerships proposals from other orgs, and trying to get funding/donors couldnâ€™t have been easy but he killed it this season.
- To Ash Kranti Srivastava for always striving for improvement. Xeâ€™s an action-oriented straight shooter who always challenged the WG to think critically.
- To Julia Pepper for letting her action do the talking. Landing the NEAR partnership was HUGE and pushed us in the right direction.
- To Carl Cervone for being such an enthusiastic contributor. He is the ultimate generalist, helping out with our grants, strategy, etc.

# Areas of Improvement

### Failures and Action Plans for Season 2

| Working Group Failures | Impact or Example | Revised Design |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lack of long-term strategy | Because we revised our KPIs many times (particularly when we transitioned into partnerships from fundraising), there was a lack of clarity for our big goals. We werenâ€™t able to take steps toward them. | Using an Objectives and Key Results system in Season 2. There should be action items under every key result, and every working group task should be in pursuit of a goal. We can use Notion databases to quickly track this. |
| Disorganization and limited participation | We were already a small working group, but we only had around 5 recurrent members. This prevented a lot of healthy discussion and expertise from being leveraged.  | Greater internal marketing of the working group and implementation of some sort of incentive. It could be merch, bounties, etc. but we need some way to motivate our busy champions and builders to contribute. |
| Centralization of working group tasks | We relied on Gary an unhealthy amount. In retrospect, we acted more as an advisory council to him, as he would be the one to receive and manage partnership inbound and inform us while we discussed the decisions as a group.

Besides that, most tasks were done by a small group (usually the recurrent members). | Use of CRM or some other database to track EVERYTHING going on in partnerships. Allow anyone to plug into each active initiative in the database. 

Leveraging discord chat more. Everything related to a partnerships should always be sent in the chat. Potentially we can lock the chat to ensure confidentiality? |
| Poor communication across asynchronous members | This is related to the point above. However, this is also a problem across the DAO as well, as the group needs to work well with other contributors.  | Ethan will send regular updates to the Dream Journal writers and send updates in DAO-wide channels. |
| Poor decision-making on task selection | Working on tasks that were inconducive to growth or simply unnecessary.  | Create a database of season-long objectives and action items, and ensure that each task is in support of one of the pillars. |
| Limited working group impact | We werenâ€™t able to organize ourselves to independently get many partnerships/sponsorships. | Relates back to the lack of organization point above; make goals clear so we can work towards them at the start of the season. |
| No productivity without meetings | We would have great discussions/meetings that didnâ€™t translate well to action outside of it.  | Improved DAO-wide and working group communication in the discord, creating incentives for participation, having impactful action items (no busywork) |

## Priorities before Season 2

- Create Notion database for goals/action items (OKRs)
- Set/Define incentives for participation (could be DAO-wide as well)
- Talk to working group members and feedback and ideas for next season
