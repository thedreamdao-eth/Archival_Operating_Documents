## Review [OKRs](https://asana.com/resources/okr-meaning) for Season 2 (10 mins)

**Here is a list of everything the community said:**

- Solidify the different roles and responsibilities that different kinds of partners would bring to the table.
- Organizing partners by the different ways we would engage with them and what they would give us (it doesn't have to be just money).
- Figure out how do we empower each working group member to go out and find partnerships themselves and integrate them with the DAO without some central power helping out in the process
- Partnering with some communities that can provide internships to our builders by the end of the season.
- Incentivizing the builders to do tasks, incentives can be bounties, sending shirts, stickers, etc.
- Being a WG, I think we can have weekly (or differently recurring) 15-20 min sessions to just unwind. We can just talk about what we did during the week/talk about life/stuff we look forward to/etc. I think this can act as a good way to bond and relax.
- We can have a WG-wide weekly journal where we can talk about the goals that we achieved, important tasks left, and what we can do to work more efficiently to contribute to achieve a long-term goal. This can also help in increasing productivity without having to hold a meeting.
- Decentralize the WG in the sense that there are always 2-3 people that others can reach out to so that if you aren't available, others can still be assisted.
- I'd love to help increase DD exposure, particularly through platforms like podcasts and twitter spaces. So maybe have a goal of securing 10 panels/guest positions for DD members to spread the word (speak on internships etc). I feel the most valuable speakers will be the builders who can speak on their experiences.
- Increase the benefits for those supporting DD, maybe through exploring the use of Impact Certificates to represent DD support, e.g. a 'EDUCATOR' certificate certifying 'you sent 1 builder on a 6-month internship' etc, or something along these lines! Maybe combine with the merit system I seem to remember seeing in some DD doc.
- Submit and secure enough funding to support DD for 2 seasons, could aim as a team to submit 10 applications this season or something. Particularly looking for Grants, although these will be tricky in the bear market
- Secure a partnership with notion to fund a separate dream dao notion + sponsor impact orgs and students
- Secure 10+ free impact-driven nfts for builder in our community
- Implement a reward system for folks who work on grant applications

**I received some personal goals, too:**

- Get to know everyone in the WG and work collaboratively together
- Understand the processes that go into forming partnerships
- Find good ways to keep in touch with those who donate/sponsor
- Be an active/recurrent member of the partnerships wg and contribute to the long term goals in whatever way I can
- Be in constant touch with everyone in the wg and the DAO to finish a task in time
- Strive to engage in any and all opportunities presented to me!

**Let’s come up with some [OKRs](https://asana.com/resources/okr-meaning)!**

- Objective: Find web3 work opportunities for our Builders!
    - **Key Result 1: Find enough value-aligned organizations to provide X paid jobs to Dream DAO builders.**
    - Key Result 2: Work with relevant people/WGs in the DAO to build a database of potential explorers.
- Objective: Establish brand partnerships that grow our Dream DAO social presence.
    - Key Result 1: Secure speaking opportunities for builders and/or champions at **X** conferences
        - Reasoning: Speaking opportunities allow builders to establish their personal brand in the web3 space while also promoting Dream DAO’s brand.
    - Key Result 2: Partner with **X** NFT collections to secure free NFTs for builders in our community.
        - Reasoning: Interfacing with other communities (like NFT communities) gives our builders access to a more diverse group of people in web3 while also promoting our brand.
    - **Key Result 3: Generate a NPS ([Net Promoter Score](https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/customer/net-promoter-score/)) of at least 8 through a partnership health survey sent to organizational partners.**
        - Reasoning: Ensuring that partners are satisfied with our relationship is essential to the success of our working group and DAO as a whole.
- **Objective: Find enough funds to sustain Dream DAO through Season 3 at least.**
    - Key Result 1: Working with Governance to create a treasury system and establish a long-term budget projection.
        - Reasoning: It’s necessary to establish a numeric goal for funding to ballpark what we need.
        - Ballpark: around $50k/season
    - Key Result 2:
- Objective: Promote a greater emphasis on partnerships across the DAO
    - Key Result 1: Create a non-hierarchical system of outreach that incentivizes community members to find leads.
        - Reasoning:
    - Key Result 2:
