## **Builders should definitely talk about:**

### *What is the Dream DAO*

- Dream DAO is a web3 x social impact DAO that provides diverse Gen Zers around the globe with the training, funding, mentorship and opportunities they need to leverage the power of web3.
- The DAO fosters an intergenerational learning community and provides the most committed young members the opportunity to get paid internships at socially impactful web3 organizations where they can gain further mentorship and meaningful experience.

## Some unique Dream DAO things that are cool:

### *Builder-Champion Relationship*

The DAO consists of:

- **Builders** (Gen Zers- 15-20 y/o when they join the DAO, who‚Äôre interested in learning about web3 while simultaneously working and exploring the web3 x social impact ecosystem and how to leverage the power of web3).
- **Champions** (established leaders representing a range of industries who seed the Dream DAO with SkywalkerZ NFT purchases and direct donations to the DAO treasury, and lend their expertise, networks, and other resources to the mission of Dream DAO).
- This builder-Champion relationship is very unique to the Dream DAO!

### *Learning Together Sessions*

- LT‚Äôs are the core product of the learning community of the Dream DAO. This is hosted twice a week and features a  community member or guest hosting a lecture on a web3 concept and spreading the word on the Solarpunk future we envision.
- Past guest hosts have included Gitcoin founder [Kevin Owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki), Ethereum Foundation Executive Director [Aya Miyaguchi](https://twitter.com/), renown web3 educator [Samina](https://twitter.com/saminacodes), co-founder of Constitution DAO [Graham Novak](https://twitter.com/gnovak_) and many more web3 luminaries.

### *Dream DAO Explorers Program*

- A two-month internship program called the Dream DAO Explorers Program‚Äîfor 15-20 year olds.
- For the pilot program starting mid-June 2022, Dream DAO Builders were placed in web3 organizations making social impact (e.g. Gitcoin, ReFi DAO, Toucan Protocol), and produced one knowledge artifact a month. Learn more about the program **[here](notion://www.notion.so/057b51e4dc864f68bf9fe93bf1464d2f).**

### *IRL Gatherings*

- Dream DAO pays for some of our community members to travel to, co-organize, and operate events.
- We‚Äôve sent out members to NFT NYC 2022, Web3Conf in Goa, ETH Mexico, and others!

<aside>
‚ÄºÔ∏è All the above points- a DAO for and by the Gen Z, builder-champion relationship, Learning Together sessions, Explorers Program and IRL gatherings makes Dream DAO one of a kind, and should be mentioned in a conference to increase Dream DAO‚Äôs network and gain potential partners and contributors.

## 5 things you should know before going to an IRL event (shared by @Rebeca Lissa)

- to craft your presentation - who you are in 1 line, what is Dream DAO, etc. Explain who you are and what you do, what is the Dream DAO in a short time.
- change your mindset b/w networking and relationship building. 'Networking' feels like a transaction but building a relationship is more positive.
- be interested in what the person is talking about, their work, etc. rather than talking about yourself (people like to be heard!)
- have a photo with the person you want to follow up with post the event. It helps people remember you.
- exchanging social handles is really helpful to reach out to them later.
