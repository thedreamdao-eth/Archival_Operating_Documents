# NEAR grant brainstorm

How can we best use the NEAR fast grant to benefit the community?

- Madison: the group is a  blank canvas to have people do what they want
    - Working group decides what they do instead of us
    - Who is in the working group
- Provide grants on a rolling basis - a lot of people have a lot of stuff going on with the Explorer’s program launch.
    - At least wait until season 2 when people are hungry and excited
    - Switch to a cohort cycle
    - The most engaged builders don’t have the bandwidth to take this on as well because they are also doing the Explorer’s program.
- Prioritize doing 1 or 2 learning together sessions with NEAR
    - Use Amber’s connections - prioritize putting together a dream list of people who would be good representatives and best benefit the community
        - Claudio - head of metapool - launching a crowdfunding platform for projects on NEAR
        - Jordan
        - Openforce Protocol
    - How will we select the builders?
        - Crypto college partnership - people facilitating chose who got it
        - Facilitated through snapshot anonymous DAO-wide voting
    - Rest of the money will be used for operational expenses
- How can Dream DAO be best useful for NEAR?
    - Test if their tooling is useful for practical, hyperlocal projects
        - Getting social justice kids into DAOs and crypto is terrifying but bridging that gap is super important. - Ash
    - Giving money to some of our builders to do things like create one or more hyperlocal projects that use NEAR tech + help onboard and educate non tech bros
        - Heavily documenting the learnings from each of those projects
        - There’s a need and an opportunity - why NEAR and why web3 and exploring that through the lens of local region sustainability space
        - Get the voice of all the people who participate in that in understanding the type of future they want to create.
        - Idea of checkpoints - should you be creating this thing you want to be creating.
            - Does the world need it?
            - Does it need to be on web3?
            - Who are you building for and building with?
            - Are those values aligned?
        - Fast movement in web3 is missing thoughtfulness.
    - Ash: when folks pull up to ranked choice voting - make a design doc with their proposed project
        - ideation to show applicants appreciate NEAR’s values and have the capacity to ideate and build out an idea - to create something from their imagination.
        - However, don’t want people to full pressured to commit to a project before fully exploring the ecosystem
    - Two tiered voting
    - Potential for builders to get even more funding through grants and crowdfunding
    - Keeping it open-ended and having people create a project or contribution
    - From Amber: “Near needs culture creation, near needs a space for literally imagining what does a sustainable future in web3 look like, I don’t know how many more reports they need. I think they need real community - what does growing a regen community look like on near”
