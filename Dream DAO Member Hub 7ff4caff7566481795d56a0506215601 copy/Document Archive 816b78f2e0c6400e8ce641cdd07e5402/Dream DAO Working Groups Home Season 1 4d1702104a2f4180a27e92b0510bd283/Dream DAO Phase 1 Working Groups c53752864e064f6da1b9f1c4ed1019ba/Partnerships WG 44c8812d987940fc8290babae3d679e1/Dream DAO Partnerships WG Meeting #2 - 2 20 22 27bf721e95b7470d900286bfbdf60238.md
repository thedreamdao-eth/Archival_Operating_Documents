## Idea Refining/Thoughts (30 mins)

### Pause for Questions

Some discussion questions from last time:

- What should happen in future wg meetings?
    - Let‚Äôs have someone talk to folks doing the most fundraising, get feedback on a whitepaper or anything that might be helpful for attracting donors. Fundraising toolkit?
- How often should we meet?

Fundraising Strategy Questions:

- What promotional materials should we have (how do we get potential leads?)
    - Talk to Champions and develop a ‚Äúfundraising toolkit‚Äù for them (what do the people reaching out need to attract more donors). Leads: Julia and Ash
- Fundraising avenues (what platform, how often, what kind of people?)
    - Chabu: Let‚Äôs make a CRM process for potential donors, Chabu will lead
    - Can we get CU donors to donate?
        - Josh: community at CU that knows that they‚Äôre an incubator. Funds are appropriated towards CU-related activities. Dream DAO used some CU funds to get started, but it‚Äôs more of separate activity.
        - Question: Do we work something out that says that CU funds have a sizeable chunk going towards Dream DAO, or are we going to break off somewhat separately?
            - Ash: Dream DAO and CU should progressively separate from a builder perspective.
            - Josh: What about Unplugged Strategies? Is Dream DAO an arm of CU, or are we separate enough to be a different entity? There‚Äôs been a significant blend between CU and DD people, so how separate is it really?
            - Gary: Legally, it‚Äôs very hard to start a non-profit DAO version. We‚Äôre currently operating in a grey area right now, benefitting from the legal structure of CU. It‚Äôs easy to get lost in the fact that most people don‚Äôt know what web3 is, and it‚Äôll be a while until it makes sense to separate because of the branding of CU and DD. Donors might not understand the concept of DAO. Right now: DD is a very promising experiment of CU, but until there is a significant shift towards non-CU alum to be builders, we shouldn‚Äôt separate.
            - Chabu: Narrative of CU and DD for donations vs. the dynamic of DD and CU as a whole. In its current state, we should consider it a branch.
            - Gary: Regardless of CU and DD nuances, Dream DAO needs to have a clear value proposition separate of CU.
            - Josh: Venture fund he‚Äôs a part of that is launching web3 investment arm that‚Äôs a DAO. Eventually, there will be arms coming out of Dream DAO that are independent.
            - Gary: CU fundraising platform that allows donors to choose whether they‚Äôre donating to CU fellowship or Dream DAO. They‚Äôre all donating to CU, but you can choose to specifically donate to Dream DAO as a subcategory.
            - Chabu: How do we get these clarifying questions answered? Do they have a CU board/team discussion or is this a DAO discussion?
                - Gary: this coming week they‚Äôll have a meeting figuring out v1 of this.
    - Issues to address:
        - Through Giving Block, we get people to donate to Dream DAO. We need a way to categorize whether people donate to Dream DAO or CU
            - Right now they‚Äôd have to text us or contact us to know whether its for CU or DD
        - We also have an Ethereum address that people can send funds to, but there‚Äôs no tax deductibility.
        - Proposed interim solution: get giving block to allow sub-categories of donations to CU or DD.
        - We want two ways to give tax-deductible donations: give butter or giving block (all through USD)
    - Chabu: Are we putting too much thought into ideating donation avenues that aren‚Äôt successful? Is direct donations not the way to go in web3?
        - We need to narrow donation avenues; can‚Äôt have decision fatigue. Why do direct donations over doing SkywalkerZ?
- Donor Perks (why should people donate?)
    - Basic benefits of SkywalkerZ: attending Dream DAO sessions. If we‚Äôre talking to a legacy foundation, we just need to bring up DD for them to donate to innovation. One-off decisions of DD or CU funds. We need an if... then... plan for what kind of donation to direct people towards.
    - If they want to be tax-deducible, then go through giving block. We need an internal tool for lead generations. CU and Dream DAO cheatsheet for donor outreach which helps
- Fund distribution (where will the money go?)

## Tasks and Reflections (5 mins)

- Reflections
    - Ash: find a time that is available for more people (champions specifically)
    - Julia: is there a way to get information on how the SkywalkerZ launch went? What was the approach we took, what have we learned, etc. (Gary and Julia retrospective meeting on SkywalkerZ postmortem)
