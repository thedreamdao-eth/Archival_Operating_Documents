The Dream DAO CRM has launched! Some quick notes:

- CRM is to document anyone who we‚Äôve talked to or WANT to talk to in the context of a potential partnership with Dream DAO.
- Swag will be given to everyone who adds 10+ contacts in August!
    - Act quick, because we are likely shifting to a merit-badge rewarding system in the future!
- Shout-out to Charlotte for being proactive and leading the charge for CRM contacts!
- Let‚Äôs all add just 1 contact each right now‚Ä¶ remember, it can be a current or potential contact!

## Next Steps Toward Dream DAO Partnerships (25 mins)

Key pipeline ideas:

- Ideation of a partnerships design doc that makes it easy to document partner flow
    - How can we lower the barrier of entry for potential partners? Nobody wants to fill out a dozen forms before they partner
        - Big ‚Äúopen evening‚Äù every so often that could get people to engage with DD (like a social event)
        - Reducing the forms to one short one; could connect with a builder to walk through the form synchronously if they want
- Creation of a Dream DAO pitch deck + outline
    - Who wants to work on this?
        - Ethan has ideas and resources to kick off the project
        - **Thanasi will take this over**
- Creation of conference training (preparing conference attendees to be good representatives)
    - Prabhat to work on this, Ethan to follow up.

Other ideas, questions, and topics to discuss:

- 

## Questions about Partnerships or Dream DAO (5 mins)

- Is there another time that would work for the working group calls?
    - Reasoning: Currently 10 AM in PT, North American builders (and maybe champions) cannot attend during school hours
    - Prabhat on a gap semester, will send an availability schedule
    - Jaynie in London; this time and up to 3-4 hrs would work
    - Shivika: school now; 3-4 hours in the future is better

## Action Items (5 mins)

- Action Items:
    - Partnerships leading the charge on the CRM: **everyone add 5 contacts** (or more, if you want swag)!
    - Quick form will be sent out soon ‚Äî¬†**everyone add 1 web3-related org** they would want to intern at (preferably, one that isn‚Äôt already a DDEP partner)
