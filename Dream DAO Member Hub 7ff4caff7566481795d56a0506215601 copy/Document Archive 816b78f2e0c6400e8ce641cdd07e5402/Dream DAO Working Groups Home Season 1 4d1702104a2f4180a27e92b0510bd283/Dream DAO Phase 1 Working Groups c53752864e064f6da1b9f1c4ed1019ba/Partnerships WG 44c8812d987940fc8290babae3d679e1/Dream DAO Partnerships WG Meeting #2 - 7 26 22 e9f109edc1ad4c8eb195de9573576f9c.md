## Steps Toward More Dream DAO Partnerships (25 mins)

- What are we currently working on?
    - Final stages of a CRM that tracks our relationship with different people and organizations in the space
    - Building brand presence through LTs, Twitter posts, community members’ social media
- What are we missing? Some possibilities:
    - A referral program for people who find donors
    - Most partnerships result from in-person conferences — we should spend more time trying to cultivate partnerships through conferences
        - Madison: If you’re going to a conference, maybe add a certain number (3-5) orgs and people that you met
    - We should try getting partnerships not only in the US; finding partners in places that are closer to builders
        - Madhav: maybe make it easier to get partnerships, so that anyone can propose some sort of partnership.
        - Kevin: See who we are all connected to in the space, seeing whether we know people abroad
        - Jon: It may not matter as much as we think that the location is abroad.
            - Carl: Most things could be a time zone issue where it’s harder to work abroad because location wise
    - Madison: DDEP has learning artifacts that has shown promise, but maybe we should check in with the partner organization
        - Would you like to participate future, how did you like intern.
        - Ethan and Madison: looking to survey or meet with the site hosts (exit interview) to see how well we are doing with interns and the DDEP.
    - Carl: Building a builder profile/testimonies that could show the caliber and type of builders that we have
        - It’s pretty unique how young we are, so we should explain the training and experience that we as builders have.
    - Twitter spaces opportunities: Madison things that there have been a slowing down of Twitter spaces opportunities; maybe we try pivoting towards more conference speaking gigs.
    - Reaching out:
        - Kevin: There’s been a lot of talks and little things that are web3 oriented, but nothing has yielded fruit.
        - Madison: Conferences have been about meeting people and good vibes, not about a specific ask. Having a next steps partnership doc to checklist what needs to be done.
    - Madhav: show partners how they can benefit from us (maybe a one-pager that shows how impactful we have been to partners)
        - Madhav: find a way to follow up with more people
    - Carl and Saf to follow up for the money-related talks
        - They can ask for the money and funding the best.
