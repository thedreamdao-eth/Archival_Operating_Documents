### 1) Name of project

Dream DAO 

## 2) Short one-sentence overview of project

Dream DAO trains and funds Gen Z to explore web3 and use it to make the world a better place.

### 3) Impact Tag

Education

### 4) **What are you making?**

*Keep it simple and write in the first person, e.g. "I'm making a documentary film about the AI Safety..."*

At DreamDAO, we are investing in the future of the web3 x social impact ecosystem by providing diverse Gen -Z’ers around the globe with the training, funding, mentorship, and opportunities they need to leverage the power of web3 to build a brighter future for humanity. Within the DAO, we foster an intergenerational learning community and provide the most committed young members the opportunity to get paid internships at socially impactful web3 organizations and attend IRL events and conferences around the world.

### 5) Impact (how will your project transform lives, revitalize communities, or regenerate ecosystems?)

The DAO is composed of Builders (15-20-year-olds) and Champions (established leaders representing a range of industries who seed Dream DAO). Builders and Champions work together every day to make the DAO better. The Dream DAO has biweekly ‘Learning Together’ sessions, funds builders to attend (and even host) IRL events, and provides opportunities to intern at impact-oriented web3 organizations.   

Since Dream DAO was launched in December 2021, we have:

1.  Hosted 70 learning together sessions, bringing leaders from different spaces across web3 to give a talk about a topic of their choice that fits Dream DAO's mission of leveraging the web3 x social impact space. Past guest hosts include Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki, Ethereum Foundation Executive Director Aya Miyaguchi; renowned web3 educator Samina, from Thirdweb; Constitution DAO co-founder Graham Novak, and many more web3 luminaries. 
2. Funded 20+ builders to attend NFT NYC, Web3Conf Goa, ETHMexico, Devcon VI, and others. In-person gatherings give invaluable experience, learning and networking opportunities, and inspiration to our Gen Z builders, this is why Dream DAO pays for some of our community members to travel to, co-organize, and operate these events.
3. Partnered with Organizations like Celo’s Climate Collective, AERA Force, Protein, dOrg, etc. to host over 15 Dream DAO builders to intern in their organizations, giving them their first working experience and an additional stipend to leverage their studies and lives.
4. Launched a 2-month mentorship program, matching a dozen Builders with Champions for direct mentorship and guidance.
5. Launched and hosted the first DreamDAO Bootcamp; an intensive month of Web3 learnings for 43 young leaders that applied to join the DAO. Our mission with the bootcamp was to  to teach our new builders the foundations of blockchain, web3, and their social impact potential, while also onboarding them as contributors to the DAO.

By 2030, Dream DAO will have directly supported hundreds of Gen Z builders to impact their local communities and the world,  trained them to start social impact DAOs and orgs that focus on public goods, and inspired over a thousand more Gen Zers outside of the DAO to explore and potentially work in the web3 x social impact space; helped define a vision for and supercharged the development of the web3 x social impact ecosystem at large.

### 6) **What progress have you made?**

*Highlight anything that shows momentum. Have you raised money? Shipped code? Assembled an impressive team?*

1. Dream DAO has raised over 250K USD with grants and SkywalkerZ sales since its kickoff.
2. Onboarded 167 voting members; 109 builders and 58 champions since its launch.
3. During season 2 we were able to effectively decentralize our governance from 1 steward to the DAO Council, consisting of 2 champion co-stewards and 3 builder working group leads. Now, in season 3 (Jan 15th – July 1st) using democrataic election on the blockchain, we were able to establish one builder as co-steward, guided by one champion co-steward, making sure that experienced builders can dive into hands-on DAO operations. Eight operational roles were also established to streamline DAO operations.

### 7) **Why are you the right person to make this project?**

*What about your background makes you uniquely suited to create this project?*

At Dream DAO we have 58 established leaders representing a range of industries who lend their expertise, networks, and other resources to the mission of Dream DAO. These people are called champions, whose aim is to provide guidance to and mentor 109 builders; talented Gen Zers (15-20 years old when they join the DAO), who have proven themselves as leaders, and are interested in exploring how to leverage the power of web3 to build a brighter future for humanity and the world. 

Each person at Dream DAO has the skills, hard work, and knowledge necessary to keep our organization thriving. The impact made by the DAO in each season was controlled, especially, by builders who put their work and willingness into every scope of the DAO’s milestones. Dream DAO works, because the people who we expect to impact are the same ones who build the impact.
