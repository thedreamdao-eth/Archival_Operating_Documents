# NEAR Education Group Design

## What is NEAR, and why should you care?

Founded in 2018, NEAR is a new, carbon-neutral layer 1 protocol based on proof of stake that uses an innovative sharding design known as nightshade to significantly increase transaction speed.  Because of their implementation of PoS, gas prices and minting fees are significantly less expensive on NEAR than other L1s, such as Ethereum.  You can read more about the technical details [here](https://near.org/papers/nightshade/). 

NEAR has a strong engineering team consisting of competitive coders and cryptography experts from around the world, and focuses on being developer-friendly— devs earn 30% of transaction fees. They’ve built in usability from the start: for example, when you create a NEAR wallet, it automatically comes with a human-readable name, without the need to buy a domain through a service like ENS. The ecosystem has also experienced significant growth in the past few months in terms of investments, new projects, and grants, raising a [$350M round](https://decrypt.co/97018/ethereum-rival-near-protocol-raises-350-million-new-funding) in April. Significantly, they also launched their first [stablecoin](https://medium.com/nearprotocol/decentral-bank-launches-usn-a-near-native-stablecoin-cafe1ec0c5af), USN, just last week, which has played a big role in driving further interest and investment in the ecosystem. 

They’re currently focusing on growing their community and ecosystem, and have some of the strongest education initiatives in the blockchain space. [NEAR University](https://www.near.university/), their education initiative, provides free certification in smart contracts, developing in Rust, and more to developers, entrepreneurs, and creators interested in building on the protocol. However, despite their efficient technology and the fact that they’re both on track to decentralize and carbon-neutral, there are currently almost no social impact ventures in the ecosystem, and there is room for more content about web3 x social impact in their education initiatives. That’s where Dream DAO comes in! 

## NEAR x Dream DAO

As part of NEAR’s fast grant initiative, Dream DAO will potentially receive $30,000 in funding to support our initiatives. $20,000 will go to compensating members supporting Dream DAO operations and funding the Explorer’s program, and an additional $10,000 will serve as education grants that support 5 builders who are committed to learning about and experimenting in the NEAR ecosystem for four months ($2000 per builder) through a web3 x social impact lens. The recipients of the grant will be determined through a transparent application process. Other than the grant, the NEAR education group will get a dedicated point of contact with the NEAR team who will be able to answer any questions that arise during the course of the four-month period. 

The NEAR team has provided a lot of flexibility in terms of what the project could look like: the only requirement is that it has to engage with the tools present in the NEAR ecosystem in some way. Some **ideas** of what this could look like are: 

1. conducting a “public goods audit” of the NEAR ecosystem to determine the current state of the impact ecosystem on the platform, with the final deliverable being a comprehensive research report distributed as an NFT through a NEAR platform
2. creating a discovery platform like [AwesomeNEAR](https://awesomenear.com/projects) designed to help match people to impact projects on NEAR that best suit their interests and skills, streamlining the onboarding process 
3. designing a DAO tool that can help impact DAOs

These ideas are **not binding**, they are only **examples**. The project will be ideated and decided by the group itself. 

 As part of this partnership, we will be hosting a future learning together session with a to-be-determined builder from the NEAR ecosystem, as well as hosting several Twitter spaces with members of the NEAR community. Additionally, we will be experimenting with Astro, NEAR’s DAO tooling platform. To manage all of these moving parts, and to support builders who are interested in diving into the NEAR ecosystem, it would be beneficial to create a new **education group** focused on NEAR.  This group will coordinate closely with the Partnerships working group, but its activities and key deliverables will be determined independently. Though there are a limited number of NEAR education grants, anyone who is interested in learning more about NEAR will be able to attend the sessions; however, only those who receive the grant will be paid for their participation in the group. The tasks of this group would include: 

1. Hosting ~30 minute biweekly meetings (the schedule for and length of the meetings can be altered based on the preferences of participating builders) to discuss a new technical or ecosystem-related topic about the NEAR ecosystem. However, the education group should still be staying up-to-date on what is happening in the ecosystem and working through educational materials from NEAR asynchronously on a weekly basis. To allow for the maximum amount of autonomy, the group will operate based on a four month roadmap whose milestones will be determined among the members themselves based on their specific interests within NEAR. The education group lead will be responsible for working with the group to deliver a comprehensive roadmap to the broader community in a timely manner after the creation of the group.
Here are some ideas on what these sessions could look like: 
    1. A NEAR educational resource, such as a [whiteboard session](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9tzQn_TEuFWweVbfTbaedFdwVrvaYPq4), the [nightshade](https://near.org/papers/nightshade/#nightshade) white paper, an overview of a technical DeFi related topic (like liquid staking), or a deep dive into one of the many dApps or platforms built on NEAR (you can check those out [here](https://awesomenear.com/projects)) is assigned ahead of time. The meeting functions like a recitation where the facilitator makes an agenda to keep the session efficient, while allowing flexibility for members to talk through the topic at hand. Once the interest group is created, a session can be hosted to develop a curriculum that is most in line with member interest and skillsets. 
    2. During the session, members of the group work together to complete a [NEAR course](https://www.near.university/courses/near-certified-analyst) and talk through any problems they have.
    3. Providing input on how to organize both NEAR-related internal awareness events and external events such as learning togethers and Twitter spaces 
    4. Designing and running experiments on Astro
    5. Co-creating content on web3 x social impact with NEAR 

## Logistics

If the creation of this education group is approved, an interest form will be sent out. Interest for the working group will be separate from the application process for the education grants.

The NEAR education grant applications will be reviewed by a panel of three Dream DAO champions to be selected on a volunteer basis. 

The facilitator of this education group (EG), a Dream DAO builder, will be determined in the upcoming Dream DAO election. In addition to the education grant, the Education Group lead will receive an additional $500 stipend for their work organizing education group activities. They will be responsible for: 

- Setting up NEAR education group meetings and organizing NEAR-related events on the public calendar
- Following up on the progress of NEAR-related projects and experiments that EG members decide to launch
- Organizing documentation around EG activities and projects in the Dream DAO Notion
- Leading communications with the NEAR Foundation team on EG activities on NEAR
