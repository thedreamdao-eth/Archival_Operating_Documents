## Next Steps Toward Dream DAO Partnerships (10 mins)

Key pipeline ideas:

- RADAR Partnership?
    - Itâ€™s an epic 7 day URL event (2 days inspiration full of events, talks and workshops, 2 days idea development, 2 days hacking and 1 day voting and celebrating) aiming to flip the script on the hyper competitive model of hackathons, to create collaborative and inclusive space for collective ideation and building.
    - It's not web3 focused, but covered everything inspired by our Centre of gravity. An imaginary world created through the futures report.
    - It's going to run right off the back of the futures report being published on the 19th September ðŸ’–
    - What's in it for your members:
        - The focus of the futurethon is to create real tangible startup, products, ideas, solutions that will exist and flourish in the better future we want. Over the course of the 2 days of ideation and development weâ€™ll have experts and the RADAR team on hand to help your members create solutions for the future. This is a space for builders.
        - After the public shared initial ideation stage, 10 teams will enter the build stage, voted on by all community members and participants to build for 48 hours, open to bringing in other members too and building mini-communities around their ideas. These teams will receive $500 per team to cover their expenses over the 2 days.
        - Then after a producing prototypes and a public demo day, the community and participants will vote on 3 projects to receive $5000 USD grants each to continue their building.
        - The RADAR team will then work with these projects post event to look for opportunities to develop their ideas either into public goods or venture.
    - Whatâ€™s in it for dreamDAO?
        - Featured in a month worth of lead up comms
        - Logo featured on the website and Socials as a Community Partner
        - Supporting and promoting positive innovation
        - Your Community Treasury will receive a Futurethon Community Partner NFT
    - Whatâ€™s the ask:
        - Weâ€™re wanting to bring together a diverse range of participants from across web2 and web3 communities. We want DreamDAO to be involved to drive forward that Regen and Builder mindset:
- Finding organizations willing to host DDEP Season 2
- Grants research and application!
    - Jon: as far as grants, itâ€™s usually more for people building things. How do we fit these grants.
- Might be helpful to have a deeper session about fundraising strategy.
    - Carl: we donâ€™t raise that much money through purely web3 channels
    - Jon: find a way to get a tax-deductible donations to encourage more large donors
    - Carl: maybe subsidizing the DDEP and getting some tokens from host sites?

Any questions?

## Action Items (5 mins)

- Action Items:
    - Ethan check in on DD x CU relationship (funding-wise and strategy)
    - Rohit: Go through CRM and tag potential DDEP partners!
    - Ethan: pulse check on how our builders feel about the RADAR futurethon to finalize the partnership (if builders are interested, we partner!)
    - Ethan: follow up with Carl, Madison, Jon (and anyone else) about funding strategy.
