### The Gist

*What is the thing you are designing?*

- **A movement-building flywheel‚Äîleveraging blockchain technology‚Äîthat makes it easy to maintain and grow a NEW üí∏ funders collaborative üí∏ (and associated Civics 2030 DAO) committed to investing 10s of millions (if not more) of dollars worth of crypto into the world's most inspiring young leaders‚Äîseeding the civic superhero development journeys of 1,000 people by 2030**

The DAO will‚Ä¶

- Will empower the most promising young leaders around the world to pursue their dreams of building a brighter future for humanity
- Will build a community of visionary CHAMPIONS committed to growing and stewarding a massive endowment‚Äîwhose sole purpose is to invest in revolutionary young builders around the world

*What are the ultimate objectives?*

- Greatly increase CU fundraising
- Change the lives of the most promising kids in our community
    - supercharge KIDS not just PROJECTS
- Greatly increase hype around CU / Civics 2030
    - Crazy amount of media attention
- Create a new paradigm for how to turn communities of practice into movements.
- Cement CU's reputation as THE premier future-building youth-empowerment org
- Greatly increase Builder engagement and retention
- Greatly increase Fellowship admissions stats

### Background

---

Here's a candid assessment of CU as of Sept 5, 2021:

- Fellowship admissions is an uphill battle - we FIGHT for our 500 starting class each cycle.
- Builder engagement is LOW - Builders don't feel like they have a good reason for staying engaged
- Fundraising for CU is trending upward but could be 10x better given how big our mission is and how AMAZING our team and kids are - we need to create greater incentives for people (especially new money) to donate

Overall, we've built a solid foundation for CU using a mix of...

- Hard work
- Being super scrappy
- 1:1 charming of donors and whatnot
- Luck
- etc

... But we still haven't built our **MOVEMENT BUILDING FLYWHEEL ‚Äî A set of key design decisions that help community members feel deeply energized and rewarded when growing Civics Unplugged and investing in its young leaders.**

***How do we do this? ü§î***

- Leveraging the power of NFTs, DAOs, as well as a clever strategy of engineering FOMO amongst potential donors and supporters
