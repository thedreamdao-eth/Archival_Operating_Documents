# Subject Line: An Update on Our NFT Launch on Nov 1

Date to send: October 31, 2021
To?: Framers

Hello Framers,

We hope you're excited about the NFT launch tomorrow (November 1st).

The plan tomorrow is as follows:

- We will post a Tweet thread announcing the NFT collection (and DAO)
- We will post a LinkedIn post that says the same thing
- **We will then email you in this email thread:**
    - **Giving you instructions on how to retweet / quote retweet the Tweet thread, as well as how to reshare the LinkedIn post**

Until tomorrow, please feel free to check out:

- [Our announcement piece which will be published tomorrow](../../%5BAnnouncement%20Piece%5D%20Introducing%20The%20Dream%20DAO%20Bui%202c12b959af8f476ea59b312be8459801.md)
- [Our whitepaper](https://www.notion.so/Civics-Unplugged-s-Dream-DAO-A-Deeper-Dive-5142d24477064342b71267242f15749b?pvs=21) (we are working on creating some very helpful graphics to put in it, that will make it easier to understand our community building and governance plan)

We look forward to hosting specialized info sessions with experts in the field about our plan with the NFTs + DAO later this week (or whenever everyone has availability). For those who cannot make it we will be recording the sessions and sending them to you.

We won't be deploying or moving around money raised by the NFT sales until we spend the time as a group ironing out the structure of the DAO. And the DAO won't officially begin operations (no members will be onboarded, etc) until after that happens.

It's truly a pleasure to build with all of you. We couldn't ask for a better group.

Onward,

Josh
