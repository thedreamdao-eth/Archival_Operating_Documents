Hey <>,

Thanks again for being a pre-launch supporter of our SkywalkerZ and Dream DAO. We hope you're excited about the public launch tomorrow (November 1st)!

The plan tomorrow is as follows:

- We will post a Tweet thread announcing the NFT collection (and DAO)
- We will post a LinkedIn post that says the same thing
- **We will then email you in this email thread:**
    - **Giving you instructions on how to retweet / quote retweet the Tweet thread, as well as how to reshare the LinkedIn post**

Until tomorrow, please feel free to check out:

- [Our announcement piece which will be published tomorrow](../../%5BAnnouncement%20Piece%5D%20Introducing%20The%20Dream%20DAO%20Bui%202c12b959af8f476ea59b312be8459801.md)

This is going to be a game-changer.

Onward,

Josh
