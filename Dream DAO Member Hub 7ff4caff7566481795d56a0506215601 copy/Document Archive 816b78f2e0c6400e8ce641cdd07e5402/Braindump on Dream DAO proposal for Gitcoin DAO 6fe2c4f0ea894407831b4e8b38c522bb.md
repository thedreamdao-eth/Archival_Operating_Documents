Gitcoin is fundamentally focused on building and funding [digital public goods](https://gitcoin.co/mission). We want to create a society that values creators and replaces corporatized infrastructure with sustainable, open, digital tools and spaces (the [metaverse](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/notes-from-the-metaverse) should not be owned by a single company).

Dream DAO is is a new intergenerational, global, and interdisciplinary community that invests in the future of the web3 x social impact ecosystem, by providing Gen Zers with the training, funding, and community they need to leverage the power of web3 to secure a brighter future for humanity.

**There are strong synergies between between Gitcoin DAO and Dream DAO as it relates to building the future of the web3 x social impact ecosystem, especially along the lines of the [public goods workstream](https://www.notion.so/Official-Public-Goods-Workstream-Overview-09d0912b9c3b4861916716f876ed77e9?pvs=21).**

This work-in-progress document will lay out a proposal for a grant from Gitcoin DAO to Dream DAO to support these shared interests:

- **Help create a funders collective** of web3-native and non-web3-native philanthropists who are committed to funding public goods in web3 + the physical world. Let's bring in traditional foundations, crypto whales, leaders of protocols+DAOs like Ohm into this collaborative.
- **Support Gitcoin's push to build thought leadership around public goods** by publishing a bi-weekly blog via the Gitcoin shared Mirror publication that details in real time the process of building the Dream DAO
- **[Build out the Dream DAO Explorer's program](https://www.notion.so/Dream-DAO-Programs-Grants-22344032d285469ca317031b7bc4d49f?pvs=21)**, which will be a 6-month digital-first leadership program for Dream DAO Builders who are looking to explore their interests in web3 and how web3 can be used to address social challenges. The pilot program will select 5-10 Explorers, and will likely begin in early 2022.
    - We plan to take inspiration from how the KERNEL program has been run. And if there are ways we can explicitly partner with KERNEL we are open minded to that!
- **Expand the weekly programming in the public goods library,** to include more speakers who are building web3 x social impact projects and who can share case studies on how others can follow suit. Also experiment with making some of these conversations public via Twitter Spaces.

Does this seem like something Gitcoin DAO would fund?

Ask: $150k

# Some Questions from Scott

**How can this proposal create more contributors for GitcoinDAO / pair with the work happening in PGF (which you touch on a bit already)**

- CU to source speakers for both the public good library channel **AND** the Gitcoin DAO Twitter Spaces series—with a focus on bringing in non-technical public goods builders to expand the "type" of public goods people are exposed to
- CU to work closely with KERNEL team to funnel Dream DAO Explorers to join KERNEL (as part of the program itself)
- CU to cohost events with Gitcoin about how its members can contribute to Gitcoin DAO and leverage its offerings (including its Quadratic Funding system)
- CU to design the Dream DAO Explorers Program to have a reward for completing all the program requirements: 250 GTC ($2500 if GTC is at $10/token)
- CU to support ****Gitcoin's push to build thought leadership around public goods by publishing a bi-weekly blog via the Gitcoin shared Mirror publication that details in real time the process of building the Dream DAO. Each post would funnel people both to the Dream DAO and Gitcoin DAO
- CU to work with Gitcoin to support the creation of a funders collective interested in funding public goods
- CU to create a web3-native and non-web3-native philanthropists who are committed to funding public goods in web3 + the physical world. Let's bring in traditional foundations, crypto whales, leaders of protocols+DAOs like Ohm into this collaborative. This benefits Gitcoin because Gitcoin depends on public goods funders.

**Why is the education work of the DAO a public good?**

- What people who call education a public good mean is **that there are positive externalities**—not all of the benefits accrue to the students. Society benefits when more people get a high quality education. Especially an education related to training young people to build tools, systems, and movements that serve public good.
- There is currently little to any educational providers focused on helping diverse 15-20 year olds learn how to use web3 to do good in the world. Web3 is so much more than what is described in news headlines. It can enable us to build systems that enable us to address humanity's greatest challenges during this make or break decade. It's mind-blowing to think about what will happen if we train thousands of civic innovators who will leverage its power to do good.
- Alumni of our Explorer's Program will go on to build world-changing DAOs, create web3 x social impact projects that make unprecedented progress on entrenched social issues, and become moral and tech savvy leaders of their respective industries. We owe it to our progeny to leave the world better than we found it. A web3 native institution that produces web3-powered civic superheroes is a public good if we've ever seen one.
