## 1. Summary

2-3 sentences on what the proposal is and what changes are being suggested without going into deep detail.

This is a request to fund the Dream DAO with GTC from GitcoinDAO Treasury to spearhead initiatives that benefit GitcoinDAO, as well as the web3 and public goods-building ecosystems at large.

The Dream DAO is a new intergenerational, global, and interdisciplinary community that invests in the future of web3 x social impact, by providing Gen Zers with the training, funding, and community they need to leverage the power of web3 to secure a brighter future for humanity.

**By funding this beginning Phase of Dream DAO, Gitcoin creates an onramp for diverse civic-minded young people (15-20) to enter and build the future of web3 and support the public goods ecosystem.**

## 2. Motivation

Describe the motivation behind the proposal, the problem(s) it solves and the value it adds. This is your chance to show why this proposal is necessary, and how the changes would benefit Gitcoin if implemented.

Web3 is much more than the billions it helps generate and the viral memes [Elon Musk helps propagate](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1451015695106560000). Early blockchain experiments in social impact and community building showcase the technology's potential to help build a future that is more resilient, collaborative, and equitable.

But this potential will not be realized without:

- An effective and scalable way to develop civic innovators who can leverage the power of blockchain for good
- The buy-in and investment in diverse communities who care about sustainability and doing good

T**he Dream DAO was launched to fill this gap.**

The Dream DAO seeks to become an educational and philanthropic institution that will sustainably attract and channel the talent and capital of web3 to develop thousands of web3-powered Gen Z civic innovators by 2030. Gen Z, after all, are those who will solve the challenges we face today and have to address the ones that are yet to emerge. And they are more than ready to disrupt entrenched power structures that fail the people they claim to serve.

**There are strong synergies between GitcoinDAO and Dream DAO as it relates to building the future of the web3 x social impact ecosystem, especially along the lines of the [public goods workstream](https://www.notion.so/Official-Public-Goods-Workstream-Overview-09d0912b9c3b4861916716f876ed77e9?pvs=21).**

I**t's important to note that education—perhaps especially education focused on training public goods-builders—is one of the most important public goods.**

Education is a public good means is that there are positive externalities—not all of the benefits accrue to the students. Society benefits when more people get a high-quality education. Especially an education related to training young people to build tools, systems, and movements that serve the public good.

There is currently little to no educational providers focused on helping diverse 15-20 year olds learn how to use web3 to do good in the world.

The fact that blockchains are immutable, transparent, and secure gives them the ***potential*** to help increase accountability in situations vulnerable to exploitation, create systems more resistant to fraud and censorship, and support those who are poorly served by traditional financial systems.

In addition to being a tool that enables the building of more just systems, blockchain can be a tool that helps us address the coordination problems that lie at the root of most of humanity's greatest challenges like climate change, global poverty, and erosion of democracy.

As CEO of [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/), Kevin Owocki, likes to say:

> Coordination failures are often why we can’t have nice things because they are rampant in many systems around the world.
> 

Web3 is critical to building a brighter future for humanity. It's mind-blowing to think about what will happen if we train thousands of civic innovators who will leverage its power to do good.

Members of the Dream DAO will go on to build world-changing DAOs, create web3 x social impact projects that make unprecedented progress on entrenched social issues, and become moral and tech savvy leaders of their respective industries. We owe it to our progeny to leave the world better than we found it. A web3 native institution that produces web3-powered civic superheroes is a public good if we've ever seen one.

 

**Regarding how Dream DAO will benefit GitcoinDAO, in "Specification", we detail Dream DAO initiatives requesting funding that will benefit GitcoinDAO by:**

- Increasing the number of contributors to GitcoinDAO
- Increasing the diversity of the contributors to GitcoinDAO
- Increasing awareness of GitcoinDAO
- Increasing the number of people building public goods
- Increasing number of traditional and web3 funders interested in public goods funding

## 3. Specification

Describe the “meat & potatoes” of the proposal. Go into deep detail around the changes that will happen both on a technical and social level. The more detail, the better.

Dream DAO (DD) will support the shared interests of Gitcoin DAO and Dream DAO in the following ways:

1) DD will **[build out the Dream DAO Explorer's program](https://www.notion.so/Dream-DAO-Programs-Grants-22344032d285469ca317031b7bc4d49f?pvs=21)**, which will be a 6-month digital-first leadership program for Dream DAO Builders who are looking to explore their interests in web3 and how web3 can be used to address social challenges. The pilot program will select 5-10 Explorers, and will likely begin in early 2022.

1. We plan to take inspiration from how the KERNEL program has been run, if not directly partner with KERNEL to make doing KERNEL a part of the Explorers Program.
2. We would like to design the Dream DAO Explorers Program to have a reward for completing all the program requirements: 250 GTC ($2500 if GTC is at $10/token)

2) DD to work with Gitcoin to support the creation of funders collective of web3-native and non-web3-native philanthropists who are committed to funding public goods in web3 + the physical world. Let's bring in traditional foundations, crypto whales, leaders of protocols+DAOs like OlympusDAO into this collaborative. This benefits Gitcoin because Gitcoin depends on public goods funders.

3) DD to support ****Gitcoin's push to build thought leadership around public goods by publishing a recurring blog via the Gitcoin shared Mirror publication that details in real-time the process of building the Dream DAO. Each post would funnel people both to the Dream DAO and Gitcoin DAO.

4) DD to cohost events with GitcoinDAO related to web3 x social impact that are of mutual interest to members. One such session could be about how people can contribute to GitcoinDAO and leverage its offerings (including its Quadratic Funding system). Another session could be a workshop on how web3 can be used to support democracy.

5) DD to source speakers for both the public good library channel **AND** the GitcoinDAO Twitter Spaces series—with a focus on 1) bringing in non-technical public goods builders to expand the "type" of public goods people are exposed to, and 2) bringing in social entrepreneurs working at the intersection of web3 x social impact who can share case studies on how others can follow suit.

## 4. Vote

Clearly outline what voting “yes” and “no” entails. Please link to [Snapshot 25](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth) or include a forum poll directly on the forum to get a temperature check under Setting > Build Poll to vote.

Voting "yes" sends 20,000 GTC to Dream DAO's treasury.

Voting "no" sends 0 GTC to Dream DAO's treasury.
