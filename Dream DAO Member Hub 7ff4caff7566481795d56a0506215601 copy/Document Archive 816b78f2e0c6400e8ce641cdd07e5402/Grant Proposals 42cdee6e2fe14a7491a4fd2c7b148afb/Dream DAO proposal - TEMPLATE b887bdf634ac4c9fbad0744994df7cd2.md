## 1. Summary

2-3 sentences on what the proposal is and what changes are being suggested without going into deep detail.

This is a request to fund Dream DAO Q1/2022 operations with **<INSERT TOKEN>** from **<INSERT DAO>** Treasury to spearhead initiatives that benefit **<INSERT DAO>**, as well as the web3 and public goods-building ecosystems at large.

The Dream DAO is a new intergenerational, global, and interdisciplinary community that invests in the future of web3 x social impact, by providing Gen Zers with the training, funding, and community they need to leverage the power of web3 to secure a brighter future for humanity.

**By funding this beginning Phase of Dream DAO, <INSERT DAO> creates the web3 x social impact ecosystem’s first dedicated educational infrastructure, [the Explorers Program](https://www.notion.so/Dream-DAO-Programs-Grants-22344032d285469ca317031b7bc4d49f?pvs=21): a 4-month digital-first program that trains young leaders to build public goods that level up all sectors of society using web3.** 

## 2. Motivation

Describe the motivation behind the proposal, the problem(s) it solves and the value it adds. This is your chance to show why this proposal is necessary, and how the changes would benefit **<INSERT DAO>** if implemented.

Web3 is much more than the billions it helps generate and the viral memes [Elon Musk helps propagate](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1451015695106560000). Early blockchain experiments in social impact and community building showcase the technology's potential to help build a future that is more resilient, collaborative, and equitable.

But this potential will not be realized without:

- An effective and scalable way to develop civic innovators who can leverage the power of blockchain for good
- The buy-in and investment in diverse communities who care about sustainability and doing good

T**he Dream DAO was launched to fill this gap.**

The Dream DAO seeks to become an educational and philanthropic institution that will sustainably attract and channel the talent and capital of web3 to develop thousands of web3-powered Gen Z civic innovators by 2030. Gen Z, after all, are those who will solve the challenges we face today and have to address the ones that are yet to emerge. And they are more than ready to disrupt entrenched power structures that fail the people they claim to serve.

**There are strong synergies between <INSERT DAO> and Dream DAO as it relates to building the future of the web3 x social impact ecosystem.**

**Regarding how Dream DAO will benefit <INSERT DAO>, in "Specification", we detail Dream DAO initiatives requesting funding that will benefit <INSERT DAO> by:**

- Increasing the number of contributors to **<INSERT DAO>**
- Increasing the diversity of the contributors to **<INSERT DAO>**
- Increasing awareness of **<INSERT DAO>**
- Increasing the number of people building public goods
- Increasing number of traditional and web3 funders interested in public goods funding

The pilot program will select 5-10 Explorers, and will  begin in early 2022.

1. To make the program accessible to talented young people from all backgrounds, we would like to design the Dream DAO Explorers Program such that Explorers get an upfront stipend as well as compensation after completing all the program requirements: **<INSERT TOKEN AND AMOUNT>**
