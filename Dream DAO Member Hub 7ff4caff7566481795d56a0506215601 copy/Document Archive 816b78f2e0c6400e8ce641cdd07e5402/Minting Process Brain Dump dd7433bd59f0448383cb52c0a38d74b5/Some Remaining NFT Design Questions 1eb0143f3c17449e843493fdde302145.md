# Some Remaining NFT Design Questions

What is the Ethereum address that we will use to create the smart contract to mint SkywalkerZ (which will be the OWNER address)?

- Should I just create a new Metamask account? **My take is Yes.**
    - Yes For Sure
- And do we use it to store the funds raised from SkywalkerZ sales until we figure out how we want to set up the DAO treasury? **My take is Yes.**
    - I think we should have another account that is SOLELY for DAO Funds.

What is the relationship of SkywalkerZ with the Ethereum address associated with our Gemini account?

- Are we still saying that SkywalkerZ can be tax deductible? Gas fees are so expensive so manually going through giving block one on one would take away 80+ bucks on each "donation" **My take is No, and that if they want a tax deductible donation they can donate directly via Giving Block.**
    - Agreed
