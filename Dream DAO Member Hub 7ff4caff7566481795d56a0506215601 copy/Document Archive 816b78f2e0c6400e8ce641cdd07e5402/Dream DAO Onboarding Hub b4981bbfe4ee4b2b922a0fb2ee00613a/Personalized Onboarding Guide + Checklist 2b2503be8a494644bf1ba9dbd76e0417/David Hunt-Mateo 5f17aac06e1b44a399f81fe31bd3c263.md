# David’s Onboarding Guide + Checklist ✅

## Hey David!

We seek to be an oasis and springboard for impact-minded Gen Zers (namely 15-20 year olds) who want to explore and contribute to regen web3 🌱 As for the current season that ends in less than 2 weeks, we are a community of about 40 “Builders” (15-20 year olds) and 40 “Champions” (mentor-type figures), who are all committed to building a SolarPunk future 🌞

As for me, I’m Karl and I absolutely love learning from people like you (well you have been in this space for a long while and you really do have had a great experience so far) and got to know so much regarding the different protocols and systems that are making it more convenient to use Crypto as a medium of exchange! I can’t wait to see more of you in our community, with an involvement that optimally suits your bandwidth. Thank you so much for your time today!

With deep earnestness,

Karl-Arman Singh 👨‍🚀
The Community Building Coordinator
