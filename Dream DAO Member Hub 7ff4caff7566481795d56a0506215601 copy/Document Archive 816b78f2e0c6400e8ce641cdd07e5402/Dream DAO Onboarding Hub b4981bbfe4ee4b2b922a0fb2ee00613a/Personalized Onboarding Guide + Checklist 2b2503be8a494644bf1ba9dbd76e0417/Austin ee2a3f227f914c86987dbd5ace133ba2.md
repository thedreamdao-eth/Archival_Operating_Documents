## Austin’s Onboarding Guide + Checklist ✅

Hey Austin!

I’m Arman-Karl, the community building coordinator, at the Dream DAO! We are a community of about 40 “Builders” (15-20 year olds) and 40 “Champions” (mentor-type figures), who are all committed to building a solarpunk future 

Click [here](https://nutshell.dreamdao.xyz) to learn more. We created this document just for you to make it as simple as possible to understand how to properly onboard / plug in to Dream DAO.

I would hope you get to read this before we touchbase soon, if possible! If you are available anytime next week, I would really love helping you how the Community can fit the best around you! We believing in creating what community means to us and you can have an equal stake of the same!

Warmly,

Arman-Karl Singh 👨‍🚀

A mad cook , composer and writer (and gap year nomad if that counts 😉)
