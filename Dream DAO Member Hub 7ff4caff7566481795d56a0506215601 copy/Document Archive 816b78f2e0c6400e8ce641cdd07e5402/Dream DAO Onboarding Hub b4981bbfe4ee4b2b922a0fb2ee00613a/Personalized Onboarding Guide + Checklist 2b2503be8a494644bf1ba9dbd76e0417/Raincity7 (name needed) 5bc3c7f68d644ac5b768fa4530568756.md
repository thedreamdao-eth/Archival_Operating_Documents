## Your Onboarding Guide + Checklist ✅

Hey there!

Welcome to Dream DAO. We seek to be an oasis and springboard for impact-minded Gen Zers (namely 15-20 year olds) who want to explore and contribute to regen web3 🌱 Click [here](https://nutshell.dreamdao.xyz) to learn more.

I absolutely love the diversity of your interests and the time you have dedicated to invest in all of them, must say that I’m equally stoked welcoming you cuz our interests have a lot in common! I am researching the Celo ecosystem in terms of how it is trying to increase banking and economic services for the global south. Here’s a link to their [white papers](https://celo.org/papers) and [ecosystem](https://celo.org/dapps).

Below is your onboarding checklist. If you’d like to know how you’d like to best plug into the DAO through a 1:1 30 minute call this week, let’s catch up!

Warmly,

Arman-Karl Singh👨‍🚀
