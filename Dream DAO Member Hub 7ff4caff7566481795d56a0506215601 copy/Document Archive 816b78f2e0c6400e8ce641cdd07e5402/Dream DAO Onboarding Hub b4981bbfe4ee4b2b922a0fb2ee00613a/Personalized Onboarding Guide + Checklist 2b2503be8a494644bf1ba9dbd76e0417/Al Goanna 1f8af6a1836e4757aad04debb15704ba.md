## ****Al Goanna****’s Onboarding Guide + Checklist ✅

Hey ****Al Goanna!****

Welcome to Dream DAO. We seek to be an oasis and springboard for impact-minded Gen Zers (namely 15-20 year olds) who want to explore and contribute to regen web3 🌱

We are a community of about 40 “Builders” (15-20 year olds) and 40 “Champions” (mentor-type figures), who are all committed to building a solarpunk future 🌞 

Click [here](https://nutshell.dreamdao.xyz) to learn more.

We created this document just for you to make it crazy simple to understand how to properly onboard / plug in to Dream DAO.

Below is your onboarding checklist. Let me know if you have any questions!

Warmly,

Joshua Cruz 👨‍🚀
