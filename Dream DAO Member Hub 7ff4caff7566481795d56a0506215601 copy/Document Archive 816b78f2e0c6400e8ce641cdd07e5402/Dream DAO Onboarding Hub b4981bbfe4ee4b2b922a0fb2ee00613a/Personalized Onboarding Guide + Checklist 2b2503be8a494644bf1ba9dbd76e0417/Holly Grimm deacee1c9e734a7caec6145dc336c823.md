- [ ]  If you have time this week, Iâ€™d love meeting for an intros call with you. However if you canâ€™t make it, feel free to leave this blank. These intros are unstructured just like most of our community hangouts and can be an awesome way to know how you can best plug into the Dreamverse!
- [ ]  If youâ€™d like to apply to be a champion of our DAO, [here](https://rwvpe5gp.paperform.co/) is the link to our champion applications. We highly value diversity and inclusivity of both our builder and champion dynamics right from their representation to operations and impact ðŸš€
