## Lambi’s Onboarding Guide + Checklist ✅

Hey Lambi!

Welcome to Dream DAO. We seek to be an oasis and springboard for impact-minded Gen Zers (namely 15-20 year olds) who want to explore and contribute to regen web3 🌱 We are a community of about 40 “Builders” (15-20 year olds) and 40 “Champions” (mentor-type figures), who are all committed to building a solarpunk future 🌞 Click [here](https://nutshell.dreamdao.xyz) to learn more.

Below is your onboarding checklist. Let me know if you have any comments / suggestions / questions! As for me, I am Arman (you can call me Karl), just graduated high school early June and am contemplating whether I should take a gap year or study in my city (btw I live in Nagpur, India haha). I absolutely love cooking food, ideas, and a lot of things solarpunk! 😂 I hope I get to see more of you, and am super stoked you got to know about us from NFT NYC. Organising a first meet up on a national level is really amazing and I can’t wait to learn more about the amazing aspects of web3 you love to be indulged in.

Warmly,

Arman-Karl Singh👨‍🚀

The community building coordinator at the Dream DAO
