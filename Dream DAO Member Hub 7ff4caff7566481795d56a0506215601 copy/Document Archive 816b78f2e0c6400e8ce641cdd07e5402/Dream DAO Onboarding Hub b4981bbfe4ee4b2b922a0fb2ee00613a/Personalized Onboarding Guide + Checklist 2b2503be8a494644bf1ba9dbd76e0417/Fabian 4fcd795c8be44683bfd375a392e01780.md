## Fabian’s Onboarding Guide + Checklist ✅

Hey Fabian!

Welcome to Dream DAO. We seek to be an oasis and springboard for impact-minded Gen Zers (namely 15-20 year olds) who want to explore and contribute to regen web3 🌱

We are a community of about 40 “Builders” (15-20 year olds) and 40 “Champions” (mentor-type figures), who are all committed to building a solarpunk future 🌞 

Click [here](https://nutshell.dreamdao.xyz) to learn more.

We created this document just for you to make it crazy simple to understand how to properly onboard / plug in to Dream DAO.

Below is your onboarding checklist. Let me know if you have any questions! And I’m Arman, the community building coordinator at the Dream DAO, just graduated from high school and always looking forward to seeing more of you in this wonderful space!

Warmly,

Arman-Karl Singh 👨‍🚀
