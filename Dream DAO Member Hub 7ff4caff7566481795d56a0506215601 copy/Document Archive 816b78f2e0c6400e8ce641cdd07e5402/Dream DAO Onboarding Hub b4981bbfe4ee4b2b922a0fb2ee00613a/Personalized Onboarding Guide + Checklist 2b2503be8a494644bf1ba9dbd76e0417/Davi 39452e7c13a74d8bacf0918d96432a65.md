## Davi’s Onboarding Guide + Checklist ✅

Hey Davi!

We are a community of about 40 “Builders” (15-20 year olds) and 40 “Champions” (mentor-type figures), who are all committed to building a solarpunk future 🌞 

Click [here](https://nutshell.dreamdao.xyz) to learn more. We created this document just for you to make it crazy simple to understand how to properly onboard / plug in to Dream DAO.

Below is your onboarding checklist. Let me know if you have any questions! And if you’d like to get on a call the coming week, I’d love to catch up!

Warmly,

Karl-Arman Singh👨‍🚀
*Community Building Coordinator
The Dream DAO*
