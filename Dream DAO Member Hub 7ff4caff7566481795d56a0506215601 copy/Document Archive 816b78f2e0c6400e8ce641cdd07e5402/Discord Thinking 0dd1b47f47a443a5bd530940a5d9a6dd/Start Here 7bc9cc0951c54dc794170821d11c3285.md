    - Providing them funding that removes financial barriers to pursuing their dreams

    - Hosting public and community-only events that bring together an unlikely cast of social entrepreneurs, DAO experts, philanthropists, web3 pioneers, and young people who can greatly inform and support each other's ability to use web3 for good

1. Directly supported thousands of Gen Z Builders in finding their "You-Shaped Hole(s)" in the world and making significant contributions to accelerating the flourishing of their communities and the world, and
2. Inspired millions more Gen Zers beyond the confines of the DAO to commit themselves to addressing impediments to  human flourishing
