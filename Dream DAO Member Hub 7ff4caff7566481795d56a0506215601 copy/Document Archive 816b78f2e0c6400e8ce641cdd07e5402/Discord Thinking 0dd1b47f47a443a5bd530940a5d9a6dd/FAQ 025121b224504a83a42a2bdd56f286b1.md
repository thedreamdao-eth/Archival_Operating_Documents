**What is Civics Unplugged?**

Civics Unplugged is a 501(c)(3) ([www.civicsunplugged.org](http://www.civicsunplugged.org/)) social enterprise whose mission is to empower the leaders of Gen Z to build a brighter future for humanity. CU partners with and is backed by National Geographic, Craig Newmark, Andrew Yang, Mike Novogratz, Audrey Tang, and more.

In launching the Dream DAO, we seek to revolutionize the way humanity invests in changemakers and our collective future. If successful, we will have enabled thousands of extraordinarily talented young people to devote their full attention to building public goods that will level up all sectors of society.

**What is an NFT?**

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a term used to describe a unique digital asset whose ownership is tracked on a blockchain, such as Ethereum. This beginner's guide to NFTs provides a good intro to the world of NFTs: [https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d](https://linda.mirror.xyz/df649d61efb92c910464a4e74ae213c4cab150b9cbcc4b7fb6090fc77881a95d)

**How many SkywalkerZ NFTs can I mint?**

You can mint up to 30 SkywalkerZ, up to 10 at at time. If you are accepted as a member of the Dream DAO, you must have 1 NFT to maintain membership, and additional NFTs do not give you more voting power.

**How do the NFTs work?**

Each NFT is unique, with different NFTs having different attributes (e.g. background, helmet, hat, chest plate) of different rarities.

It is easy to resell these NFTs on any NFT marketplace like OpenSea.

Holding a SkywalkerZ NFT is required to apply to be a member of the Dream DAO.

**What is a DAO?**

DAOs are internet communities with a shared cap table and bank account. This beginner's guide to DAOs provides a good intro to the world of DAOs: [https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o)

**Is participation in the DAO required?**

No. But purchasing a SkywalkerZ NFT helps fund the DAO.

**What are the benefits of being a member of the DAO?**

- Join a community of like-minded funders and builders
- Access to the Dream DAO Discord
- You will be airdropped governance tokens if we choose to release one
- SkywalkerZ resale value will grow as the Civics Unplugged movement grows

**Why are we reserving a SkywalkerZ NFT for every SkywalkerZ sold?**

We are reserving a SkywalkerZ NFT for a Gen Z grantee every time a donor purchases a SkywalkerZ NFT so that the Dream DAO "Champions" and Gen Z grantees are all incentivized to contribute to the success of Civics Unplugged's youth-centered movement.

This system incentivizes Champions to hold their SkywalkerZ NFT(s), so that Gen Z grantees benefit from the rising asset value of the NFTs.

Giving grantees NFTs is not just a great way to help grantees generate wealth, it also helps accelerate their financial literacy—especially of decentralized finance—by virtue of having skin in the game.

**How is it decided which members of CU’s existing Gen Z community get to join the Dream DAO?**

They will be selected by the Civics Unplugged team with the advisement of our Gen Z lead Steering Committee based on a variety of factors which primarily focuses on involvement within the community and interest in learning web3 and engaging + cobuilding with the Dream DAO Champions. In Phase 2, the members of the Dream DAO will collectively review and select new members from applications. In Phase 3, membership is managed by a dedicated working group.
