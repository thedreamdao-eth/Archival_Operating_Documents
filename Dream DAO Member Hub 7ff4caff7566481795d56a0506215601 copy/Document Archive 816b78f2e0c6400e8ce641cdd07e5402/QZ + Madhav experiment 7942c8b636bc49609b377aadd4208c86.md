# QZ + Madhav experiment

Season: S1

Explainer:

1. Databases
    1. Tasks - each task is an atomic unit of ‘things to be done’ so as the example is shown below, madhav has been assigned a task. This way we can track progress as we are going across the entire DAO on a single page. What’s interesting is that if we go into madhav’s individual contributor page he can see the tasks that are just his own only so that he doesn’t get confused but everyone gets to see all tasks being done. This transparency is important because you don’t have to ask around ‘who is doing what’ or ‘what is done’.
        1. 
    2. Team - this page is for individual contributors. what’s important is that you can create a sort of ‘phonebook’ and also use that as a personal contributor page. all contributors can have their own and all important information is stored into this single page. Contributors can be encouraged to customise it according to their preferences. Also, this way one can easily check the tasks done, projects a contributor is in, and documents they’ve worked on.
    3. Documents - I’ve created one database for this, some people might prefer splitting it up. eg. proposals, minutes, working documents etc. Basically all documents go into this gigantic database. This makes it easy to create some form of standardisation

1. Projects - could be weekly Learning Together, Fundraising etc, working groups will show up here. So what you’ll have is that the projects can be used as a filter or displayed in a gallery similar to what was created below. Each Project page will then serve as a landing page for the initiative. **WG = Projects**

1. Working format - the trick is that all these databases have relationships with each other. meaning. you can have Contributor_A work on Document_B in Project_C in Task_D. Document_B could move around different Tasks, such as Contributor_B working on Document_B in Task_F which might be another part of the document. Or Document_B could be from Project_C and when done move to Project_D (eg. pitching > proposal_
    1. Oh so we could make a column in everyone's profile where we could link the tasks and stuff
2. Projects - its a generic term but it seems we can rename them as working groups
3. Workflows - the challenge here is giving access to people because there’s a lot of smaller databases. as dreamDAO is small, you can give all contributors full access. eventually what gitcoin chose was to have a ‘contributor access bundle’ and give access to non-sensitive databases.
