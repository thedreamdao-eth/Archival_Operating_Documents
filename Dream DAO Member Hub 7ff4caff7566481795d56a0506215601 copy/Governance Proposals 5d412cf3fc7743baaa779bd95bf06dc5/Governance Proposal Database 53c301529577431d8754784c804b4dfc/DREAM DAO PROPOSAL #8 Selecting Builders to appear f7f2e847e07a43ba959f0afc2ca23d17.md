üí°**Description:**

The community will elect 2 Builders who will accompany Gary in representing the Dream DAO at the Forefront Podcast, newsletter and community on March 11, 2022 at 12pm EST. After the election, the Builders will coordinate with Gary prior to the event to ensure firm messaging and coordination.

- As this is a huge opportunity for the DAO, we must elect Builders who are strong communicators and understand the true essence of the DAO.
