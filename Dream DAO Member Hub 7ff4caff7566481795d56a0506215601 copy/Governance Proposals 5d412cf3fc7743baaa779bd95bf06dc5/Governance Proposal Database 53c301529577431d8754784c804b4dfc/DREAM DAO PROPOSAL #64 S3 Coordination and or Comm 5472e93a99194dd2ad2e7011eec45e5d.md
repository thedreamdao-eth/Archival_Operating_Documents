🎯**Goals:**

1. Propose the continuation of the role of Coordination Wizard
2. Conduct an election for the role of Coordination Wizard
3. Define the work of Coordination Wizard in S3

🏋️**Point of Contact:**

**arath#3541**

💡**Description:**

- Role description ✏️

The Coordination Wizard makes sure the DAO operations and community are functioning correctly. The assigned person will utilize tools that help them understand the current status of the DAO and propose changes to the community if deemed necessary. They create and promote strategies and processes to keep the community united.

## Responsibilities 📒

Responsibilities are distributed in **four areas:**

**DOCUMENTATION AND DATA MANAGEMENT** 📈

- Manage the **DAO Seasonal Census** as necessary to keep track of members and identify community necessities to solve as soon as possible.
- Manage **documentation (**with the help of WGs and Stewards**)** (working groups, stewards, bounties, and other responsibility centres)
- Utilize **metrics, forms, documentation, or any data sources** to provide or design **opportunities** for the community.
- Manage **bounties** and report information to the Co-Stewards for the distribution of bounty payments.
- Analyze member **engagement** (event turnout, frequency of contributions, bounties), contact inactive members, and seek solutions that benefit both parties.
- Present a monthly (or bi-weekly) **recap** with the help of Co-Stewards, documented data, and contributors.
- Present a **report** mid-season and at the end of it to prepare improvements for the next season.

**COMMUNICATIONS** 🛰️

- Look over the **Discord Community.** Facilitate communication channels from the external community to stay in touch with the DAO. (tickets, channels, forms, email addresses, etc.)
    - We abandon our Friends of DAO frequently.  Let’s stay engaged with them via Discord, work together with the Gatherings WG to create events they can attend, and contribute to the Dream DAO CRM.
- **Answer inquiries** from members, potential members, and friends.
- **Make** and **review** forms (elections, hackathon elections, financial aid, community health, etc).
- **Provide** the community with a season plan/course.
    - Ex. Make a document/infographic telling the community what we should do by x month in the season and abide by it. If S4 applications are set for May (example), the wizard must ensure everything is ok for this to happen.

**RECRUITING** 🔭

- **Create and review** seasonal **applications** and announce results with the help of an interim council, considering the performance of the season they are on. Do note that the Co-Stewards are in charge of the onboarding.
    - We brought up the safety point when we reviewed apps for S2. Since we are a US-based organization dealing with minors, we should care about the safety of our members when bringing new people. This is why we are interviewing applicants to know they are who they claim they are.

**ROLES**  💼

- **Pull out elections** and announce results with the help of an **interim council.**
- Review roles. Check for functionality and efficiency and discuss with the DAO!
- Weigh in on **financial decisions and** search for **efficient ways** to allow Dream DAO to earn more money to **fund builders** to gain skills used for **hackathons.** (PMs, UX, UI design, programming, marketing, etc.)

## This proposal proposes the election for the role of Coordination Wizard for S3 ✅

## Requirements (for S4) ✅

- All interested members in this role should at least have finished one season in Dream DAO.
- (Discuss with governance if merit badges should give members the right to participate as election candidates)

## Payment 💰

Some S2 tasks will be done by Co-Stewards, but with data playing a notable role in the development of this DAO, the workload has slightly increased due to the constant data updating and consultation of different responsibility centres.

This is an evolution of the CBWG lead with some bits of governance. 

The CW will get paid hourly at the rate of 17 USD per hour. 

Total season 3 spending: **$6,000.00 (Estimated)**
