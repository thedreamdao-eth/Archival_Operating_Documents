🎯**Goals:**

1. To establish agreement that the DAO wants to create unique Builder and Champion NFTs for each DreamDAO Class or Cohort for both commemoration and permissioned control for voting and governance.

🏋️**Point of Contact:**

ProfessorStam

💡**Description:**

- The aim of this proposal is to establish a cadence of creating unique Champion and Builder Badge NFTs to solidify DreamDAO roles on chain for the particular DreamDAO class or cohort.  These NFTs should have their own unique art style that should change every new class that is onboarded and should be non-transferrable so as not to allow for unauthorized voting and governance participation by non-builders or champions.  The NFT should grant access to voting on formal DreamDAO proposals on snapshot.
- When a class or cohort is closed, the NFT will be a commemorative badge that will no longer have voting rights.  Should a Champion or Builder roll over into the next class or cohort, they will be issued a new NFT to represent that phase of the DAO and will be granted voting rights through the new NFT.
- This proposal is to confirm the DAO wants to move forward with this idea.  The technical details will be researched and proposed in a separate proposal.

💚**Benefits:**

- Allows for on-chain validation of DAO member roles
- Acts as a programmable control to ensure only builders and champions can vote on that class’s DAO proposals (Whitelists work tactically but have additional operational risk and require more controls to ensure members are not accidentally left on or off the list)
- A forever reminder, validation and commemoration of participation in the DreamDAO, a valuable addition to an “On Chain Resume”.
- Should a member be voted in or out mid cycle, the NFT acts as a valuable way to document inclusion or exclusion in the DAO.  The NFT can be burned from someone’s wallet by the DAO to ensure they cannot claim or misrepresent being kicked out or leaving.

📈**Success Metrics:**

1. It is agreed every Builder and Champion are issued a unique non-transferrable NFT for the genesis class of the DreamDAO
2. A formal process is researched, voted on and documented and sits within the Governance working group to fulfill the task of issuing new NFTS for every new class of DreamDAO Builders and Champions

🗓️**Duration:**

- Start: February 2022
- End: Implemented for rest of DAO life unless voted to be removed

💰**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**

- This proposal is to confirm we want to create champion and builder badges.  Technical details such as blockchain and minting costs will be determined in another proposal.

💸**Token Distribution: (Sponsors’ control)**

- None

🤨**RISKS: (Open to All Members)**

- ProfessorStam: Member loses their wallet where the NFT is.  DAO will have to vote to reissue and burn NFT
- Madison: Not a reason to reject this proposal, but this isn’t necessarily trustless *“The NFT can be burned from someone’s wallet by the DAO”*
