💡**Description:**

Creating the Meta WG, which serves to coordinate cross-working group projects and facilitate projects that are not assigned to a working group. The Meta WG will consist of a select few Builders who are highly active and in-tune with the community, who can handle facilitating and supporting several different projects at once. Meta WG members will also work to improve the culture of the DAO and engagement in the DAO, and facilitate and improve best practices. Ash Kranti will serve as the interim lead.

💚**Benefits:**

- We will now have a group committed to getting things done that don’t fall under or slip through the cracks of other working groups, and an interim lead to be responsible for that working group

📈**Success Metrics:**

1. Number of tasks completed by end of Phase 1
2. % of Working group coordinators who feel like meta working group has been helpful at the end of Phase 1

🗓️**Duration:**

- Start: March 10
