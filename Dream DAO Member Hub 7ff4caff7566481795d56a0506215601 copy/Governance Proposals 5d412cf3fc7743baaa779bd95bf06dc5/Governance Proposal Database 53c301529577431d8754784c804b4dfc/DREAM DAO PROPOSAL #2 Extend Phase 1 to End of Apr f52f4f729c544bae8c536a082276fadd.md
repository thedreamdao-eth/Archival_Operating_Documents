💡**Description:**

- The aim is to officially expand the length of Phase 1 from end of March 2022 to end of April 2022

💚**Benefits:**

- Ultimately, this is to ensure that we have plenty of time to...
    - Learn Together as a community without feeling too squeezed for time
    - Get into a healthy rhythm + make plenty of progress on each [Working Group](../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Working%20Groups%20Home%20Season%201%204d1702104a2f4180a27e92b0510bd283/Dream%20DAO%20Phase%201%20Working%20Groups%20c53752864e064f6da1b9f1c4ed1019ba.md) key result
    - Build the Explorers Program (which we in Explorers Program wg quickly realized doesn’t need to be 6 months, but more like 3 - 3.5 months from Mid-May to late August)
        - The reasoning for this updated length is to shift much of the learning to be accessible to the entire Dream DAO community via Learning Togethers. The Explorers Program can be more focused on an internship + other built projects in a tightened window.

📈**Success Metrics:**

- All the key results we’ve already listed for the working groups

🗓️**Duration:**

- Effective immediately. If this is approved, we will update the documentation that mentions Phase 1 length / roadmap.
