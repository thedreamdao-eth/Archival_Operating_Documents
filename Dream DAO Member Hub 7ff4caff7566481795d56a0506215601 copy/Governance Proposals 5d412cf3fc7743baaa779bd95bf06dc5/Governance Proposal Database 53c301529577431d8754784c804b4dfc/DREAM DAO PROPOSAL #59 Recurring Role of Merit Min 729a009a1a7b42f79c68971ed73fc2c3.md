💡**Description:**

Create the role of Merit Minter.

The Merit Minter will be someone who can deliver the Badges once per month based on who submits the form with proper evidence to voting members (builders & champions) and manage a database to know how many badges each voting member has.

This role is of utmost importance since having it would facilitate the delivery of badges, and there could be a certain system for them (reviewing the requested badges, corroborating the evidence and delivering them to the member).

At the moment there is no person chosen for this role, but it is intended that, if the role is approved, Governance WG will choose the person who will perform the role until the person is no longer able to perform it.

Most of the work will be concentrated at the end of the each month.

🗓️**Duration:**

- Start: From the current Season.
- End: As it would be a chosen by the Governance WG, it would be until the chosen person is no longer able to handle it and the WG will chose a new one.

💰**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**

- Hourly compensation for the role ($17 x hour)
