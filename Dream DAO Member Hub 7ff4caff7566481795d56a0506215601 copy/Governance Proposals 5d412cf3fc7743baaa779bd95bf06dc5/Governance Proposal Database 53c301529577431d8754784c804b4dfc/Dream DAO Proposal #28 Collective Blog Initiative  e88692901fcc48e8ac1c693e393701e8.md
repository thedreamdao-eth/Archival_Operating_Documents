🎯**Goals:**

1. Have the DAO agree on allocating some money to ensure a high quality start for the Dream DAO Blog.
2. Create a pipeline of real-world experience content so that new aspiring builders could connect.
3. To set up a system that rewards builder writers for sharing their web3 journey and editors for reviewing their blogs.

💡**Description:**

- The aim is to establish a way to encourage builders to share their stories of what it's like being a GenZer in Dream DAO / web3 as a part of the “The Roads of Dream DAO” Collective Blog by giving them small bounties, while also rewarding the editors.
- Check here for more info on the initiative: [“The Roads of Dream DAO” Blog Series](../../Design%20Documents%20&%20Braindumps%2096c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae/%E2%80%9CThe%20Roads%20of%20Dream%20DAO%E2%80%9D%20Blog%20Series%20a6b763cb3b614aa9a7b2a84c13d4adcc.md)
- Collective Blog Entry Approval process:
    1. Writers submit their blog/writing to the [#dream-dao-blog](https://discord.com/channels/896096170621947974/955939922299215924) channel
    2. A thread is created for reviewing each blog.
    3. A Champion raises their hand to edit the blog post / being tagged.
    4. The Champion who has stepped up as the post editor suggests edits (both content and copy edits - editing shouldn't just be fixing grammar/punctuation). Writers can incorporate any other comments from the thread (but only if they want to). Writer fixes the edits and resubmits to the same editor.
    5. Once both writer and editor are happy with the final version, the post is considered approved. No more edits/suggestions at this stage - the goal shouldn't be to make sure everyone thinks it's perfect (too hard and frustrating for a writer).
    6. Status of the blog post is updated in the table (blog’s hub), the post is posted to personal Mirror account, and the info block is added [here](../../Design%20Documents%20&%20Braindumps%2096c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae/%E2%80%9CThe%20Roads%20of%20Dream%20DAO%E2%80%9D%20Blog%20Series%20a6b763cb3b614aa9a7b2a84c13d4adcc/General%20Mirror%20Post%20Draft%20382e62da10904231a0f7e974107396f9.md) by the writer.
    7. Writer gets paid $50 while the editor gets $50.
- For this initiative, each editor will review up to 5 posts depending on their interest / bandwidth.

💚**Benefits:**

- This initiative will attract decent attention towards the Dream DAO Blog.
- Dream DAO gets content for Mirror and Twitter pages.
- Builders are less nervous about posting their writing on Mirror.
- Builders improve their writing skills through the editors’ suggestions.

📈**Success Metrics:**

1. Dream DAO gets enough content to post on Twitter for 5 weeks (posted bi-weekly, so 2*5+10 blog posts).
2. The [General Mirror Post Draft](../../Design%20Documents%20&%20Braindumps%2096c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae/%E2%80%9CThe%20Roads%20of%20Dream%20DAO%E2%80%9D%20Blog%20Series%20a6b763cb3b614aa9a7b2a84c13d4adcc/General%20Mirror%20Post%20Draft%20382e62da10904231a0f7e974107396f9.md) consists of at least 10 blog info blocks.
3. Writers and Editors get compensated fairly for their contributions.

💰**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**
