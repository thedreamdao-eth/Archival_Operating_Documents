🎯**Goals:**

1. **Make our Discord Safer by adding verification of members.**
2. **Make our Discord less confusing and easier to navigate.**
    1. Make the design of the channels & categories more pleasant and organized.
    2. Clean up the unused server channels to decrease member confusion
3. **Make our Discord more active (esp. publically).**
    1. Decrease the number of channels with the same purpose and move these channels more to the public category (e.g. moving the non-sensitive general discussion to a public chat to engage visitors and arriving supporters in it)
    2. Rearrange categories based on the activity of each type of member

***Note:** non-infrastructure related ideas (e.g. changing some channels to forums, designing the rules and the moderation policy) are to be dealt with after we implement these changes.*

💚**Benefits:**

- Safer Discord without messages like this (fake project acc):
