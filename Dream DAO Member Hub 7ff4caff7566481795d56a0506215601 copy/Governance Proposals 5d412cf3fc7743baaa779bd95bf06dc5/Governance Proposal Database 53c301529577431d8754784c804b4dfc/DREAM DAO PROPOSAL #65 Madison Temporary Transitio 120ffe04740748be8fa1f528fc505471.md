üéØ**Goals:**

1. To extend Madison‚Äôs role for 1.5 months.

üèãÔ∏è**Point of Contact:**

Madison#9398 & **PlantBoi#9075**

üí°**Description:**

### Why would this role be valuable?

As we begin Season 3 with new leadership, there are lots of transitions for the DAO to adjust to. In order to make this transition as successful as possible, it has been advised to Madison that she retain her role during the transition period to support the new leadership structure. Madison was officially no longer employed by Civics Unplugged/Dream DAO on January 1st. However last week, she realized there were will some responsibilities that she could not transfer over yet. 

Last week, she met with Celo/worked on the grant, accepted new Builders, and began to onboard the new Co-Stewards. This week, she will need to continue to work on the Celo grant and onboard the new Co-Stewards, along with doing some final work on the Explorers Program. 

Alongside this, it would be good for Madison to dedicate time over the next month to help Co-Stewards get settled in their new positions. This might include passing over important information regarding responsibilities to be carried out by Co-stewards as the CW steps down; establishing connections between Co-stewards and key people outside of the DAO (CU members, Funders etc); helping advise the Co-Stewards/WG leads on initial decisions, and helping them welcome the new builders. 

## Additional Considerations

This month is the beginning of a new leadership structure and will serve as a test to determine if the Co-Stewards will need additional help from a Coordination Wizard role like the one Arath proposed. A CW-assisted transition period seems necessary to allow the Co-stewards and WG leads to receiving the knowledge to get set up to test this new system properly. After this month, if the Co-Stewards still need help, we can determine the areas that need supporting and run an election for an appropriately matched Coordination Wizard role. 

## Scope

Here is the proposed scope of the role: 

- **Timeline**: January 16th - February 16th (Because that is the earliest the proposal could be passed)
- **Hours**: 8-10 per week
- **Compensation**: $1,500 total (Hard to estimate, but this should cover the retroactive from early January and working 8-10 hours per week into February, so basically the salary for a month and a half)

üíö**Benefits:**

- This will be beneficial for DAO in the leadership transition phase.

üóìÔ∏è**Duration:**

- Start: January 16th
- End: February 16th

üí∞**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**

- $1500

üí∏**Token Distribution: (Sponsors‚Äô control)**
