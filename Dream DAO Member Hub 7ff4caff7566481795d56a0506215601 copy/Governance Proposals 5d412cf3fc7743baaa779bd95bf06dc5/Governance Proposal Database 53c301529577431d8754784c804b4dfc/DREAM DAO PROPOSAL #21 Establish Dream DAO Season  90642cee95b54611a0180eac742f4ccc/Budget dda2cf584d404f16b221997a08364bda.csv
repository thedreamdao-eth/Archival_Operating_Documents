Dream DAO - Chief Alchemist,28000,"We need a full-time or near-full time staff member tasked with ultimately being accountable for the successful completion of every DAO Season key result.

This “Alchemist” is also the default representative of the DAO to the public/media, devotes the long hours required to build trusting relationships that lead to grants and interest from potential strategic partners, and spearheads the process of evolving the DAO roadmap as needed.

This will be Civics Unplugged team member Gary Sheng for Season 2 (he will be dedicating 70% of his CU/Dream DAO staff time on Dream DAO work). There will be elections for this role for Season 3. Gary devotes 40-60 hours a week on Dream DAO related work a week.

There are four months in Season 2, thus we need to budget $28,000 for the Alchemist.",1 - Must do
Dream DAO Working Groups,20000,"We have several working groups within Dream DAO that each serves an important purpose. There will be a coordinator that receives a fixed payment each month for overseeing and being accountable for the working group. Each working group would also have some allocated budget, with different working groups likely having different budgets based on need. The working groups are as follows:

1. Governance 

2. Partnerships 

3. Community Building

4. Gatherings

Assume each coordinator receives up to $750 / month and there are 4 working groups. Each working group will have some additional allocated budget. There will be some TBD allocated budget for different working groups to reward members for going above and beyond normal contributions in their working groups. Let’s assume an additional $500 / month until we figure out the exact numbers? So, $1,250 / wg / month, leading to $20,000 for Season 2 across wgs.",1 - Must do
