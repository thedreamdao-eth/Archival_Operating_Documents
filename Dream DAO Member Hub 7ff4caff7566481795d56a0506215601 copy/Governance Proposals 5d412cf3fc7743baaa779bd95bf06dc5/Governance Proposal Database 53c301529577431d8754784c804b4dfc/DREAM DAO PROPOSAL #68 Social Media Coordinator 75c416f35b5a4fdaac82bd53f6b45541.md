üéØ**Goals:**

Define the Social Media Coordinator role requirements and set up an application form for the recruitment of the 'Social Media Coordinator‚Äô (Twitter Guardian evolution) role now the TG‚Äôs initial trial period has ended.

üèãÔ∏è**Point of Contact:**

PlantBoi | PLANTGANG#9075  Madison#9398

üí°**Description:**

1. Defining the Social Coordinator Role
2. Outlining the application process to fill this role position.

## 1. **Social Coordinator Role:**

After reading and processing the discussion on the Twitter Guardian Evolution thread the following areas were highlighted. Here are some proposed solutions and how they protect the DD budget.

| Highlights after the TG role trial period (highlighted by Marco Bear#8146 and DAO members) | Proposed solution | Reducing/maintaining budget? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Difficulty producing content on internal DAO happenings | As part of the new accountability structure currently being formulated we should be able to streamline information flow to the Socials Coordinator more easily.

Streamlining occurs through an accountability structure. Of particular interest to the SC would be:
-WG Leads send their updates weekly to the ../../Working%20Groups%201a2aa07165c8493fac51cdd42f4d1ba5/Working%20Group%20Weekly%20Updates%20395523a09e814bffa69b611a6c5c9d18.md
 
The socials coordinator then:
    - Checks the updates weekly
    - Turns the updates into multiple posts and threads | This ensures the Socials coordinator doesn‚Äôt need to invest lots of time tracking DAO-wide events, since roles such as WG leads and Co-stewards are already involved in this. |
| Type of content prioritized?
This was discussed mainly by highlighting two areas:

-Content highlighting internal DAO happenings/achievements (events, builder highlights, internship learning artifacts etc)

-Content about outward happenings (RTs, comments or posts highlighting/making connections to DD-related orgs/people and projects). | Overall there was no 100% consensus for either content type.  Therefore perhaps we can explore a flexible strategy of:
-60% Internal DAO happenings
-40% Outward engaging content

(changes to this can be proposed after time by the Socials Coordinator/DAO members if a better solution becomes clear) | The internal content generation will be made easier by the streamlined information flow mentioned above.

Appropriate external engaging content will be found by the Socials Coordinator following the role guidance. |
| Twitter spaces requiring extra time for the role to organize | This will be the role of the Gatherings WG to organize relevant and engaging Twitter spaces. | Reduces Socials Coordinator workload associated with organizing Twitter Spaces. They will still need to join spaces and give chosen speakers permissions to host. If they cannot do this, another member will need to be appointed to do this by the SC. |
| Branching out to other socials? | Stick to Twitter socials for now. Branching out seems overcomplicated and out of budget for now whilst web3 lives largely on Twitter (we can always explore this down the line). | Keeps hours and budget down for the role. |

## Role Requirements:

With this knowledge the proposed role criteria may look like this (parts in green are taken from the original role proposal by Bear (Marco)#8146):

- The Twitter guardian will post original Tweets and some retweets depending on what‚Äôs going on every working day (100 every month/ not to be exact), following a flexible monthly strategy linked to the goals and priorities of the DAO. For example, this may look like 1 original tweet and between 2-4 Retweets a day depending on appropriate retweet content being available.
- Keep a specific list of social media relationships with people who know Dream DAO updated (list is found within the Twitter account). This includes updating the list with new DAO Builders/Champions and tightly associated projects monthly.
- Maintain a Twitter content schedule that runs 2-weeks ahead of the posting schedule. It will:
    - Contain as much details of the actually to-be posted content as possible. When the exact posting content isn‚Äôt available yet, give details of the type/general idea of the content to be posted.
    - Be sent to the Co-steward‚Äôs each week to be checked over. This will ensure the content is of a high enough standard to represent the organization on this key social media platform. If the content is consistently of a very high standard in areas like grammar, content focus, layout etc, the DAO Council can choose to remove this need (evaluated earliest after 2 months).
- Monthly meeting with Co-stewards and SMC. This discussion will
    - Allow the SMC to provide some basic metrics from Twitter to give insight into the success from socials that month, allowing for any adjustments to strategy needed to be discussed
    - Help prioritise events/members/areas to highlight on Twitter

## **Application process:**

- **Why have an application?**
    
    The Twitter guardian role had an initial trial period between November and December 2022. Now this period is over it feels appropriate to carry out an official application for this role, allowing all DAO members a fair chance at this opportunity. The application will ask candidates to submit some example tweets and content following a guidance document, allowing the new candidates to be judged on their merit and skill for the role (as was seen to be effective recently for deciding who would run the DD Bootcamp).
    
    Application questions may follow this loose plan below (Application questions to be finalized by DD Council and turned into a submission form)
    
- **Who can apply?**
    
    **Any member of the DAO is free to apply for this position.** Strong applicants will have a good understanding of the DreamDAO project and have some experience relevant to this position.

    Announcing new role positions and member cohorts
    Sharing big questions we are thinking through / things we are trying to figure out in our DAO
