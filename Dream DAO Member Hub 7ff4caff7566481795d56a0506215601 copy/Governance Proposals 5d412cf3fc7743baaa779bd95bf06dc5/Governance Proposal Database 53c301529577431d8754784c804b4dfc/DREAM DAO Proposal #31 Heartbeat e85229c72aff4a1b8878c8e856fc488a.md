🎯**Goals:**

**Increase accessibility of the DAO by:** 

- Improved information/documentation organization
- Customized onboarding
- Better version of [intros.ai](http://intros.ai) in the platform
- Less overwhelming design for conversation
- Better video/audio chatting

💡**Description:**

The proposed change is to move the Dream DAO’s messaging platform from Discord to [Heartbeat](https://www.heartbeat.chat). Heartbeat is a messaging platform that organizes both conversation and information in a much more accessible way than Discord, and has many useful features such as customized onboarding. To watch our conversation with the CEO, see [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/RW1tCunxGUtndarbN9W3Cb0uiHYxsSc4na8GZOWCyACVaZTKJ8KEjwAG42Zjnt_i.h8h6aaa9NV6ixjXh). 

We propose using Heartbeat for Season 2, and if we like it, using it for future seasons. 

💚**Benefits:**

- See “Goals”

📈**Success Metrics:**

After two months on Heartbeat, a survey is sent out to the DAO and >80% of people are getting more value from Heartbeat than Discord 

🗓️**Duration:**

- Start: July 1st
- End: November 1st

💰**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**

- $120 USD (Heartbeat for Season 2, $30/month for 4 months)

💸**Token Distribution: (Sponsors’ control)**

🤨**RISKS: (Open to All Members)**

- Transitioning people is always a challenge, but I think we are already looking for our most engaged members to renew their membership for Season 2 and this could be a part of that

🤓**COUNTERPOINTS: (Open to All Members)**
