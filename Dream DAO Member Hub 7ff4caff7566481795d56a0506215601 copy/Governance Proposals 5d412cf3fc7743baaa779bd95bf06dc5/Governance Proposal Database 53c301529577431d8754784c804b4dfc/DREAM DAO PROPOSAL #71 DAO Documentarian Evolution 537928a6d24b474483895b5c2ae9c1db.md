- Content to produce:
    - An engaging thread that summarizes the LT session events
    - 1-2 interesting quotes from the host speaker
    - A visual screenshot from the session (this can be an interesting slide, ideally including the host and audience if agreed with them during the session by the LT session facilitator. The LT facilitator will ask that anyone not willing to have themselves captured notify the host in DMs or the session chat. In this case, they can be blurred, or the image can capture only the slides)
