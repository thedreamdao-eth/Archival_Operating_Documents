# üì¢ÔΩúannouncements

Category: ‚ï≠‚îÄ üë• Frens & Members
Accessible by: DreamerZ, Friend of DAO
Remark: Since we only post LT announcements here while other events are public, maybe post LT announcements in the LT channel?
It will allow us to post truly big events for public visitors to see, too + will make the server less confusing

# Rationale

Announcements for the following purposes-

- Learning Togethers
- Solarpunk x Desci convos
- Other community events available for HODLers / Friends (more details [here](../../../../Design%20Documents%20&%20Braindumps%2096c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae/Structure%20for%20Events%20and%20Spaces%20in%20Dream%20DAO%202747bdaecf9b47bb9be81ab5960bd5f0.md))

The Announcements are preferably BATCHED (so as to avoid multiple pings, that thing hurts üò≠)

Peeps can RSVP the event in advance / choose to be emailed the calendar invites

- This thing can work out when we have a Friend of the DAO / NFT Hodler hub of peeps who choose to be involved in events but not through Discord. It is a good and a stable way to keep the community accessible to all
