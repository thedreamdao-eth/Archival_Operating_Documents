🎯**Goals:**

🏋️**Point of Contact:**

Madison#9398

💡**Description:**

We put out an application for role on May 25th. We will do ranked-choice voting to identify the person for the role. 

Please read the responses of the 3 applicants: 

- **Shreya**
    
    **Why do you want this role? Why would you be effective at it?**
    
    I would like this role because it would allow me to greater my passion for web3 by learning new things each week that I can later help condense into nuggets of knowledge for anyone on Twitter to understand. I would be effective at it because I have helped out with writing event recap threads and taking notes for Learning Together sessions and I have the ability to condense complex topics into something that is easier to understand (very helpful for Twitter threads). I'm also a responsible person and do have the time to dedicate myself to this role (I can start ASAP).
    
    **Anything else?**
    
    I'm very interested in this role
    
- **Adarsh**
    
    **Why do you want this role? Why would you be effective at it?**
    
    This role will help me in getting a deep understanding of web3 space and having more insights.
    
    **Anything else?**
    
    I understand Twitter, my experience can help in drafting recaps in a way to get more impressions. Also, I can help organize all the previous recap threads in our notion hub for events, I can see these are not currently there.
    
- **Jae-Hee**
    
    **Why do you want this role? Why would you be effective at it?**
    
    I usually end up doing it anyway so I might as well apply for this, I thought.
    
    **Anything else?**
    
    Could someone else be responsible for posting it on Twitter? I'm ok with writing it but do not desire posting responsibility.
