🎯**Goals:**

1. To establish a governance process for approving partners with the Dream DAO
    1. This includes the process to raising a potential engagement all the way to proposing and voting on with DAO members
2. Establish the Partnerships WG (and wind down the Fundraising WG)

💡**Description:**

- On the establishment of a Partnerships Working Group...
    - The Partnerships working group will be in charge of evaluating all inbound partnership requests. Some of these partnerships may involve securing funding.
    - It’s very important that partnerships are run through the community, because they can affect everything about how a DAO operates. Even a funder that wants to give Dream DAO a check with no strings attached comes with a brand that could negatively affect the brand of Dream DAO.
    - Additionally, with the establishment of the Partnerships WG is to wind down the Fundraising WG, which we’ve realized does not need a working group (yet). 90% of fundraising is covered by NFT sales and the cofounders of Dream DAO (Josh, Thanasi, and Gary).
- On the process for engaging and potentially securing a new Dream DAO partner
    - Member engages with potential organization to discuss potential partnership and terms
    - Member brings partnership idea back to the DAO into the #partnerships-wg chat on our Dream DAO Discord
    - Coming out of the forum if it is approved, member creates a proposal with details around:
        - The potential partner and their mission
        - The intersection with DreamDAO
        - What the partnership will entail (what does DreamDAO give / receive and vice versa)
        - If there is any funding or commitment required
    - Proposal shall be voted on and approved by voting members of the DreamDAO
    - If successful, communication will be coordinated and partnership will commence

💚**Benefits:**

- Gets DAO approval before partnering with other DAOs and organizations
- Allows for the assessment of risks and due diligence of partnering with other organizations and can help to protect DreamDAO’s reputation
- Allows for the DAO to understand the potential benefits to the DAO if the partnership is made and any potential use of treasury funds before going to approval

📈**Success Metrics:**

1. A clear partnership governance process is outlined
2. Future partnerships are approved using the process
