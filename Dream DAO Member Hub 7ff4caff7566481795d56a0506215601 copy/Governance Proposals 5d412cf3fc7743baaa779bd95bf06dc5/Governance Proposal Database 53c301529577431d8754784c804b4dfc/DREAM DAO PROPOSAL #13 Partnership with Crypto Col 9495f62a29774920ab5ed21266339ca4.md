🎯**Goals:**

- Provide an additional learning path for Builders, that allows them to apply web3 concepts in a product development framework.
- Develop a mutually beneficial relationship with another organization committed to making web3 learning more diverse and accessible.

🏋️**Point of Contact:**

Saf (Saf#2338) and Jae-Hee (jae#7088)

💡**Description:**

- [Crypto College](https://cryptocollege.latecheckout.studio/) has reached out to us to offer scholarships for our Builders to participate in their accelerated practice-based learning program. The program is designed to allow learners to take the often-abstract concepts behind NFTs, DAOs, and social tokens, and apply them in a project/product development framework.

Their next program is slated to start on May 2, 2022, and will include options for:

- 1-track program that includes just the course curriculum
- 2-track program that includes courses + a project component

In exchange for the scholarships, Cypto College has asked if they can include us in their promotional materials and potentially have cross-promotion through hosting Twitter Spaces together, including in each other’s newsletters etc. Promotions may also include highlighting our members as part of their alumni network.

💚**Benefits:**

- Keen and motivated Builders will have access to another path for learning how to use web3 tools in ways that shift for-profit endeavors to align with the goals of public good.
- Experience working with web2 product development/management natives in transition from web2-web3.
- Builders who don’t participate in the Explorers program can benefit from this accelerated program to put some of their Dream DAO learning into practice.
- Increased exposure for Dream DAO, could potentially bring new Champions/Friends to the DAO

📈**Success Metrics:**

1. 
2. 

🗓️**Duration:**

Ongoing partnership, unless terminated by either organization through a subsequent community vote. The voting period is 5 days.

💰**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**

💸**Token Distribution: (Sponsors’ control)**

- 

🤨**RISKS: (Open to All Members)**

- Crypto College operates within the corporate sector; poor framing of partnership may risk appearing as if we are not maintaining integrity to our social impact cause
- The partnership could end up being tokenistic - creating more positive publicity for Crypto College while not actually empowering diverse voices in their program
