💡**Description:**

All of the USD expenses incurred so far by the Dream DAO have been made using Civics Unplugged’s credit card.

The aim is to transfer USD expenses CU Incurred for Dream DAO (from May 1st, 2022 through the end of May 2022) to CU’s ETH wallet.

These expenses include:

[Expenses since May 1st, 2022](DREAM%20DAO%20PROPOSAL%20#32%20Transfer%20USD%20Expenses%20CU%20In%203667a42aa9a4434bb9f358d500e66987/Expenses%20since%20May%201st,%202022%20f6e122064c0e4e889033478cea712bc6.csv)

The transfer will be a ETH transfer from the [Dream DAO Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x1a685948F476ad329d9c038c992dB79BDE9B89E6/balances) to Civics Unplugged’s Ethereum Wallet: 0x0bEaa0F57Be9b7249c7af4fdCB60A9B15162004F
