💡**Description:**

- As three of our Dream DAO builders (Madhav, Rohit & Tarun) will be in Bangalore for ETH India, it would be great for us to connect with like-minded folks. Many of our builders come from India but there are no champions based in India. We want to use this opportunity to promote Dream DAO in the Indian ReFi community and onboard potential champions to Dream DAO.
