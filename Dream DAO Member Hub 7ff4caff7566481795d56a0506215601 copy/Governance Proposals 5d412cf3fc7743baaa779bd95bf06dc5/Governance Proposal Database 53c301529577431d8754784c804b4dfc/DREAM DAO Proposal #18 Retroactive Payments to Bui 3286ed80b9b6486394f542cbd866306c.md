**Gary will be managing the process of Builders seeking to amend their retroactive payment tier.**

**If you have a suggested edit to the above section, feel free to add a comment or DM Gary on Discord by 8pm ET on Tuesday, April 12th, 2022.**

**Also, feel free to add missing contributions [here](../../Document%20Archive%20816b78f2e0c6400e8ce641cdd07e5402/Dream%20DAO%20Contributions%20Log%2079aa8266fcc44da3bb60c648c01cd522.md).**

### üíö**Benefits:**

- Builders will see that Dream DAO is a community that values and appreciates their commitments
- People can utilize their stipends to purchase NFT or ENS, or use them for paying college/school exam fees, contribute to their learning, or something else. Take some time to think about how to put your crypto into something web3-related. We can brainstorm as a community what those things might be.
- Shows potential investors / donors our true commitment to compensating our Gen Z community members

### üìà**Success Metrics:**

All Builders listed in this proposal receive the noted payment by the end of April.

### üóìÔ∏è**Duration:**

- The ETH should be distributed by end of day on Sunday, April 17th, 2022

### üí∞**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**

- Cost (assuming 1 ETH = $3,000)
    - 3,000*.1*5=**1500**
    - 3,000*.13*3=**1170**
    - 3,000*.16*15=**7200**
    - TOTAL = **$9,870 USD**

### üí∏**Token Distribution: (Sponsors‚Äô control)**

- None

### ü§®**RISKS: (Open to All Members)**

- One risk is people not feeling like they are on the right tier. This can be mitigated by giving Builders an opportunity to challenge their tier.
- Sending people ETH may not be helpful if there are effectively no fiat off-ramps in their countries.

### ü§ì**COUNTERPOINTS: (Open to All Members)**

- This removes almost $10,000 from the DAO treasury, and was not planned for.
