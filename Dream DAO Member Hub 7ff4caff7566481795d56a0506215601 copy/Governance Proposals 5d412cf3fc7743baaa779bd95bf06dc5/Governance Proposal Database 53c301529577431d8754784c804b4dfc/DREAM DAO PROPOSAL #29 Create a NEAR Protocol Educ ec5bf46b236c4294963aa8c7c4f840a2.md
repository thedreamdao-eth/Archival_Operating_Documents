When approved?: June 2, 2022

üéØ**Goals:**

1. Create an education group focused on the technology and ecosystem of the NEAR protocol as part of Dream DAO‚Äôs new partnership with them as part of their fast grants program
2. Grow the currently nascent web3 x social impact ecosystem on NEAR (a promising carbon-neutral layer 1 protocol!) 
3. Pioneer a framework for future interest/education groups within that DAO which are not working groups because they are not focused on core DAO infrastructure and operations activities, but still form an important part of experimentation / exploring niche subtopics within Dream DAO

üíö**Benefits:**

- Have a direct impact on growing the web3 x social impact ecosystem on NEAR
- Build a relationship with a fast-growing L1 protocol
- Provide an additional compensation and career growth opportunity for builders
- Create a space for more technical education/training in the DAO through learning about the technical and ecosystem specifics of NEAR

üìà**Success Metrics:**

1. Net promoter score for education group participation from builders at the end of the 4 months

Other success metrics will depend on the specific project education group members decide to pursue (e.g. engagement rate for content, etc.). 

üóìÔ∏è**Duration:**

- 4 months

üí∞**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**

- Of the $30,000 total funding from NEAR (which is still pending), we request $10,500 for as 5 $2000 grants for builders in the education group, and an additional $500 to compensate the education group lead for their additional organizing efforts.
