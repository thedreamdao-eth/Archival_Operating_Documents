🎯**Goals:** Having a person that leads Dream DAO’s Twitter with content and strategy adapted on a monthly base.

🏋️**Point of Contact:**

Bear (Marco)#8146, @MarcoBear_eth

💡**Description:**

Create the role of Twitter guardian.

The Twitter Guardian will keep Dream DAO’s Twitter page active and updated continuously.

The Twitter guardian will post original Tweets and some retweets depending on what’s going on every working day (100 every month/ not to be exact), following a flexible monthly strategy linked to the goals and priorities of the DAO. 📝

A specific list will be created to create social media relationships with people who know Dream DAO (with daily interactions and retweets).

I am proposing myself for this role. I would be a great candidate as it’s something that I’ve been passionately doing social media management in the last 5 years to maintain myself. For reviewing some of my recent work (web3 related) please check [All For Climate’s Twitter page](https://twitter.com/all4climatedao?s=21&t=IjNbkhinvy3zeyuzKyTIpQ), which I have been managing for the last 4+ months, with around 40k impressions last month.

`If this proposal is approved, Marco (Bear) will act as the Twitter Guardian for the next 2 months.` 📝

🗓️**Duration:**

- Start: From the approval of the proposal
- End: After 2 months of the trial period. 📝

💰**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**

- 500 DAI / Month
- Payment: Crypto ideally
