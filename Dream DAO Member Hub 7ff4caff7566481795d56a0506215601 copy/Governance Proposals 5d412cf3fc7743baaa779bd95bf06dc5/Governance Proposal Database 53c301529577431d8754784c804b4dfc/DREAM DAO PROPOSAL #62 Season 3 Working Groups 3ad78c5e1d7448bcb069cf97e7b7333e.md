🎯**Goals:**

Defining the structure of Working Groups in Season 3.

**💡Description:**

As our DAO continues to evolve, so will our working groups! Working groups improved a lot from Season 1 to Season 2, and we want them to continue to improve into Season 3. We have learned a lot about how to set up working groups for success, and this proposal reflects those learnings.  

**Key Takeaways** 

---

- Workings groups operate best when creating things/ideating, not fulfilling recurring tasks that could be done better by an individual (which is why we have recurring roles)
- Working groups operate best when they have a very clear focus- not a broad one where they could be doing many things. When there are too many things a working group could be doing, it can be easy to get distracted. It is better to focus working groups on a specific topic/set of responsibilities so that they know what their priorities are.

### Proposed New Working Groups

---

| Governance Working Group  | This would remain the same, there is a very clear set of responsibilities and solid structure for the group.  |
| --- | --- |
| Grants Working Group  | This is an evolution of the partnerships working group. I think naming it the grants working group gives it a very specific focus instead of too broad “partnerships”. The key results can be very focused- like apply to 10 grants throughout the season and secure $30,000 in funding. People can divide into groups to write and help refine grants. This will also include getting creative- like finding people at the grant-giving organizations to reach out to and chat with.  |
| Gatherings Working Group  | This is a combination of the gatherings and community building working group. 

This working group can be responsible for both online and IRL events. 

There will be 2 primary responsibilities: 
Community hangouts: Community events (maybe twice per month) 
High level event planning: Like choosing which conferences we attend. The specifics will be carried out by co-stewards |

### Proposed New Accountability Structure

---

- Working groups must meet at least 2 times per month
- Every month working group contributors are invited to submit a form providing feedback on the working group
    - Co-Stewards will write “Scorecards” each month that integrates the members’ feedback and their observations
- Halfway through the season, the Co-stewards will conduct a performance review of WG leads with a 1:1 call
- A bi-weekly summary of all the working groups will be shared DAO-wide via Dream Journal.
