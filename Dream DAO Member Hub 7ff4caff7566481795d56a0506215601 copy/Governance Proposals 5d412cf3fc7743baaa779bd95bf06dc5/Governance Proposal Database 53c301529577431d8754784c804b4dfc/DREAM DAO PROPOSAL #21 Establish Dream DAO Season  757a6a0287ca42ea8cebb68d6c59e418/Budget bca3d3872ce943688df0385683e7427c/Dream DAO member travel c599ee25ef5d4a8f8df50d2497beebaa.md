# Dream DAO member travel

Cost in proposal : 30000
DMC Comments: Can we decide on sponsor contributions for both travel and shirts. Logos on the shirts show support.

For travel, we can offer the builders as people who will work the crowd/booth on behalf of the sponsor

Gary response: Yep!
Estimate of actual cost : 20000
Explanation: This is part of our Celo grant. 

Letâ€™s assume that each trip for an individual costs ~$1,500. That allows ~15 individual trips to happen if we budget $20,000 for that.

Mexico is August budget 
Priority: 3- Could do
Prof Comments: Can we just forecast the events that will be coming up in the next 4 months and put some numbers to it (i.e. lets extrapolate from both domestic and international event costs we just witnessed in the first season and bring that forward).  This will help us to make better decisions down the road around where we go etc and ensure we stay within budget

Gary response: yes we need to get more granular, but that can come in time.
