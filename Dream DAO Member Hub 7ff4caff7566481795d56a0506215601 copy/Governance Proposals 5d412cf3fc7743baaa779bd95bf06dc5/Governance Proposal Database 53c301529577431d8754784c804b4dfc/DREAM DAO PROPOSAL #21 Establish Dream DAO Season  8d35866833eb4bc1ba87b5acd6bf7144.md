🎯**Goals:**

Achieve clarity around how much we need to budget for Season 2 of Dream DAO

🏋️**Point of Contact:**

💡**Description:**

The aim is to create a framework for budgeting for roles and activities for Dream DAO, in the lead up to Season 2, so there is clarity on roughly how much money we need to raise.

Season 2 will go from June 1st to September 30th.

Here are the most costly budget areas, which are subject to change.

Carl says: I added some V1 priority levels for budget line items, so if we fall short of budget goals, it’s easier to make cutbacks

💚**Benefits:**

- Everyone has clarity on where money is going to be spent

📈**Success Metrics:**

1. We do not exceed originally allocated budget by over $10,000
2. Analysis of the budget's implementation is made at the end of the Season 2 (identifying the flaws of this budget model and learning from the mistakes and successes!)
3. The basis for the next budget model (for Season 3) is established

🗓️**Duration:**

The relevant timelines are simply the start and end date of Season 2.

- Start: June 1st, 2022
- End: Sept 30th, 2022

💰**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**
