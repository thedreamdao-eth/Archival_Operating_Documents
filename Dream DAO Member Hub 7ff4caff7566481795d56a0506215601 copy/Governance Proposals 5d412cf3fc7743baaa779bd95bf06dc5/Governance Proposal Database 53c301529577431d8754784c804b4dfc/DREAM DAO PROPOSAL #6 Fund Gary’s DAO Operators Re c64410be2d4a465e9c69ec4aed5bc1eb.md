🤓**COUNTERPOINTS: (Open to All Members)**

- Gary: Despite there being daily remote working time, I will be less productive in executing on existing things we believe we should be executing on. That said, getting the opportunity to take a step back and think about how to level up how we operate things (with DAO experts nonetheless) is very useful. Also, I will be / have already been delegating a lot of the administrative things to people like Madison, Ash, and Tim.
- Professor Stam: To Gary’s above point, its expected less productivity in day to day, but the benefits you will gain may outweigh those lapses in productivity so that should be considered an offset
