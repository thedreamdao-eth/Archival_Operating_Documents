# SXSW Dream DAO Networking Event

Cost: 430.1
Notes: Gary for Dream DAO jointly hosted a brunch with Gitcoin in Austin attended by members from Serena Ventures, 1729, donor type people, and other DAOs/projects that could be helpful to Dream DAO / CU in one major way or another in coming months. Building the Gitcoin relationship alone has yielded us 4,900 GTC since launching Dream DAO.
