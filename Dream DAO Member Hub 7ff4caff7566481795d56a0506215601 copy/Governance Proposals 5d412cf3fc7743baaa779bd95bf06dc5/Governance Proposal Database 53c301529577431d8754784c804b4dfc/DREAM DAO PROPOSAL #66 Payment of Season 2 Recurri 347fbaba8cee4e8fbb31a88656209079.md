🎯**Goals:**

This new proposal has 2 objectives:

- Hourly rate update for recurring roles that began at the start of season 2 in the DAO.
- Reward the experience gained by builders who play a recurring role since the beginning of Season 2 with a fairer and more standardized compensation.

### 💡**Description:**

After 6 months of the creation of the Recurring Roles in Dream DAO at the beginning of Season 2, the people who have maintained one of these roles have been working and carrying out each role with their respective responsibilities and key results. Many of them (thanks to the Dream DAO opportunity) have gained a lot of experience and have improved the skills that they use every time when performing the work they do in the DAO; this in turn is beneficial for those who maintain the role, as Dream DAO offers them the opportunity to gain work experience and to define their future plans and goals both for the DAO and personally.

In addition, this has led them to perform the work better and more efficiently than before, resulting in them spending considerably less time on it, which is great for the DAO as this is one of the main reasons why the recurring roles were created in the beginning (you can find the first document of the creation/payment of the recurring roles here [Paying Recurring Roles ](https://www.notion.so/Paying-Recurring-Roles-bb7da01ce5c243ce852ccb4aace8008b?pvs=21)). 

Some of the people who have a recurring role say:

- “I’ve definitely gotten more efficient as I’ve gained experience. I’ve standardised procedures, messages, and processes”.
- “Currently thanks to the experience I have been able to create processes that make me more efficient and therefore the time spent is less and better each time.”
- “The time investment has reduced. From last three months, the hours spent has reduced to half.”

For this reason, I propose to update the payments of the recurring roles that started at the beginning of Season 2 in the DAO to be paid at a rate of $20 USD/hour as a standard, this with the objective of rewarding the effort, time invested in learning, performing and compensating the experience acquired to the builder that performs a recurring role.

<aside>
💡 To get a clearer picture of how this would not significantly affect our treasury and how it compensates the builders involved, the following example taken from a recurring role is described:

At the beginning of season 2, I was spending 7 hours a month on my recurring role. After 3 months I was doing the same tasks and responsibilities in 4 hours, which says that my work decreased by 3 hours and it has been like that since then until now.

If we propose 20 USD/hour and the person keeps working 4 hours per month (even less this season), this person will be earning 80 USD/month (12 USD more with the $17 hourly rate but 39 USD less since this person saves 3 hours of the work time due to gained experience).

This ensures that the budget is not brutally increased and is compensated in a fairer way.

</aside>

The recurring roles that would be included in this proposal are:

- Recurring Role of Agreement Coordinator (previously known as Communications Coordinator)
- Recurring Role of DAO Documentarian
- Recurring Role of Dream Journal Writer
- Recurring Role of Learning Together Coordinator
- Recurring Role of Onboarding Coordinator
- Recurring Role of POAP Wizard

The recurring roles of Twitter Guardian and Merit System Coordinator are not being considered in this update as they were created in the last months of Season 2 and the purpose of this proposal is to compensate the roles that started at the beginning of Season 2 (some roles even existed in Season 1 such as POAP Wizard, Journal Write, etc.).

The responsibilities of the recurring roles are maintained as before, making this compensation for the hard work, experience and perseverance in each of them.

### 🗓️**Duration:**

- Start: Starting Season 3

💰**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**

- $20/hour for S2 recurring role as mentioned above.
