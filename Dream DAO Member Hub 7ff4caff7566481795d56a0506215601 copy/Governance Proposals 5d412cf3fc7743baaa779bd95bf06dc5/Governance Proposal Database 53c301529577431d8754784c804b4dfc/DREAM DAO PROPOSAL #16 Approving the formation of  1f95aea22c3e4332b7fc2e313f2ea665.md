🎯**Goals:**

1. A new working group (Dream DAO Documentation WG, let’s call it **DWG** in this document) to create a container for the many important responsibilities that should be undertaken by DAO members related to documentation and knowledge sharing

🏋️**Point of Contact:**

    **garysheng#5729**

💡**Description:**

- We need a lot of documentation that we are currently missing, which will be taken care of by DWG.
- We don’t really need a social media working group, Gary has it covered for now.

💚**Benefits:**

- This working group is responsible for the following responsibilities:
    - do all event recap thread
    - write regular lessons from the DAO posts / videos
    - do the Dream journal
    - keep Dream paper updated
    - create and keep updated Dream DAO member how tos:
        - onboarding
        - hosting LT sessions
        - running for election
        - etc...

📈**Success Metrics:**

1. Ensure the sustainable growth and flourishing of the Dream DAO
2. Ensure that Dream DAO is a place where you can be a leader and not have to be “on” all the time
3. In terms of nearer-term objectives (within 6-12 months):
    - Create an ecology of documentation that ensures that anyone can fill in for anyone in Dream DAO. the bus factor for the DAO should be very low if we document what it takes to fulfill every major role thoroughly!
