🎯**Goals:**

1. Make Discord more organized by cleaning up unused roles
2. Represent Current roles (WG Lead, Recurring, Co-stewards) in a clear, structured way
3. Clean up the unused bots and add the ones that we’ll need.
4. Make the Discord roles easier to navigate (tags, finding responsible people/bots, etc)

**Note:** non-infrastructure-related ideas (e.g. changing some channels to forums, designing moderation policy) are to be dealt with after we implement these changes.

💚**Benefits:**

- All the unused roles are deleted.
- Roles’ appearance in the profile is more organized.
- Will be easier to tag people responsible for roles.
- The number of bots decreased to essentials to make using them less confusing.

🗓️**Duration:**

- Start: When the proposal is approved
- End: Approx. the first week of Feb to implement the changes

💰**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**

- none
