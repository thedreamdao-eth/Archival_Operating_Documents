üéØ**Goals:**

1. Formalize the booking process for flights and other travel accommodations (like hotels/Airbnb)
2. Formalize the background check process for chaperones and other adults on trips with Dream DAO Members
3. Establish a support position that reports to the Co-Stewards and the Gatherings WG Coordinator.

üèãÔ∏è**Point of Contact:**

dariel#2030

üí°**Description:**

- This proposal will establish the position of ‚ÄúTravel Logistics Lead‚Äù
    - Hourly position of $17 USD/hour, OR a base stipend of $50 USD per trip coordinated (whichever is greater)
        - This allows for fair compensation. Dariel has a lot of valuable experience with the travel booking process and may work faster at booking trips than others, but that also means he may be compensated less for the same work someone else may complete. The base stipend guarantees fair compensation and the hourly pay allows for advanced situations to be compensated accordingly.
    - **Responsible for:**
        - the background checks of adult chaperones on all trips (and submitting updated background checks for returning chaperones)
        - maintaining a database of checked adults for Gatherings WG to identify vetted chaperones, and allowing folks to check on the currency of their background check
        - verifying that every member has the proper documentation needed to travel in accordance with the destination regulations (such as passport, IDs, and vaccination status)
        - booking travel itineraries and lodging on behalf of Dream DAO Builders who cannot be reimbursed for expenses
        - purchasing tickets or coordinating the transfer of tickets on behalf of trip attended and the Dream DAO
        - preparation of Civics Unplugged legal documents for builders to sign such as permission slips and liability/photography waivers
        - and any other duties prescribed by the Co-Stewards and Gatherings WG.
    - Dariel Cruz Rodriguez (*darielc.eth*) will serve in this role, as he has been maintaining these responsibilities recently for the Goa and ETH Mexico trips (specifically background checking chaperones and booking accommodations.) In the event the role becomes vacant, the co-stewards shall assume responsibilities until a new person is selected by the community.
- This proposal establishes the process for Background Checking chaperones in accordance with the Chaperone Guidelines
    - The Dream DAO will use the services of [Checkr](https://checkr.com/), which Civics Unplugged has agreed to pay for under their umbrella of programs.
    - All chaperones must supply their legal name, place of residence, and email to the Travel Logistics Lead within 72 hours of being identified as a chaperone for any Dream DAO-sponsored or related trip.
    - The chaperones will receive an email to which they must fill out sensitive information that will aid *Checkr* in clearing them to chaperone. This data is private and encrypted by bank-level technologies that cannot be accessed by DAO or Civics Unplugged staff. We can only see if they‚Äôve been cleared or not.
        - Example of a **cleared report**
        
        [criminal_1657658765.pdf](../../Design%20Documents%20&%20Braindumps%2096c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae/Dream%20DAO%20Proposal%20-%20Travel%20Logistics%20cfabb5ca73a14bbda4a9f8a40d48e9f9/criminal_1657658765.pdf)
        
        - Example of a **denied report**
        
        [criminal_1657658771.pdf](../../Design%20Documents%20&%20Braindumps%2096c62424d0454ec2bd5170ad5dce5dae/Dream%20DAO%20Proposal%20-%20Travel%20Logistics%20cfabb5ca73a14bbda4a9f8a40d48e9f9/criminal_1657658771.pdf)
        
    - Cleared reports are valid on a trip basis, for every trip a new background check must be done. If there are multiple trips within a three-month span, the check will be valid for all trips in the three-month span, starting with the first trip.
- This proposal establishes the booking process preferences for Dream DAO
    - Dream DAO Builders are preferred to book their trip itineraries on their own and get reimbursed by the DAO.
        - If a builder cannot afford to be reimbursed or cannot for any reason participate in this process, the Travel Logistics Lead will meet with them to organize an alternative process.
    - Champions must book their own travel itineraries and are preferred to book the lodging for the trip if they are able to.
        - If a chaperone/champion cannot afford to be reimbursed or cannot for any reason participate in this process, the Travel Logistics Lead will meet with them to organize an alternative process.
    

üíö**Benefits:**

- This process clears up any unknown/grey area with travel expenses and itineraries, which is important when working with minors and our parental partners.
- Consolidating the background check process with one trusted member of the C.U. Team allows for discrete resolution of any disparages in the background check process.
- The position allows one point of contact for trip accommodations, which is not only important to the businesses we book with but also for the participants who experience trouble traveling.
- This proposal compensates Dariel for the valuable work he has already been doing.
    - Dariel has saved Dream DAO $564 USD already between two quality bookings on the Goa, India trip. Quality bookings mean the flights still include bags and are insured.
- This position allows the Gatherings WG to prioritize planning valuable and enriching events for our Builders and Champions rather than focusing on logistical questions.
- This does NOT replace the Gatherings WG Lead, this role is merely a support role to book and organize on the plans of the Gathering WG.

üìà**Success Metrics:**

1. Travel accommodations are booked in a timely manner (within 1 week of request, preferably within 3 days)
2. Travel accommodations are lined up with the vision the Gatherings WG has planned out for trips, including timing arrival and departure times together and taking into account schedules/agendas put together by the Gatherings WG.
3. All chaperones are accounted for and background checked.
4. Dream DAO saves money on flight bookings through a variety of means.

- End: End of season 2 (which can be renewed)
