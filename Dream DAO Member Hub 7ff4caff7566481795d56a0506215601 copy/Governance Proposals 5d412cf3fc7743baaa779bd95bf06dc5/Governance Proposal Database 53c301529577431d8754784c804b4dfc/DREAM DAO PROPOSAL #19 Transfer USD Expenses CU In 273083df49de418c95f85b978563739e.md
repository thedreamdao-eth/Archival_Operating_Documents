💡**Description:**

All of the USD expenses incurred so far by the Dream DAO have been made using Civics Unplugged’s credit card.

The aim is to transfer USD expenses CU Incurred for Dream DAO (from February 25th through April 30th, 2022) to CU’s ETH wallet.

These expenses include:

[Expenses since February 24th, 2022](DREAM%20DAO%20PROPOSAL%20#19%20Transfer%20USD%20Expenses%20CU%20In%20273083df49de418c95f85b978563739e/Expenses%20since%20February%2024th,%202022%20fe6d720020774d35b106a6f67c85287b.csv)

The transfer will be a ETH transfer from the [Dream DAO Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x1a685948F476ad329d9c038c992dB79BDE9B89E6/balances) to Civics Unplugged’s Ethereum Wallet: 0x0bEaa0F57Be9b7249c7af4fdCB60A9B15162004F
