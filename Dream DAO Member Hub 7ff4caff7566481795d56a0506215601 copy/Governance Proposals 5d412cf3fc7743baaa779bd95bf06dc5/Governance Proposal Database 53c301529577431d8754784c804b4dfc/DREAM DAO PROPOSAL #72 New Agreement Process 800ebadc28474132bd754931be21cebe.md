üí°**Description:**

> The proposal outlines changes to the current voting process in Dream DAO, including extending the feedback period, allowing a reworking phase, shifting the voting time, and encouraging active involvement.
> 

Objective:

- Improve the voting process
- Increase voter turnout

Introduction:
Proposals are crucial for the functioning of our DAO, as every major decision by the DAO needs to be first approved by the community. A quorum is essential to implement proposals, even those with broad consensus. Dream DAO has recently faced challenges in reaching a quorum for proposal voting. To address this, the Governance WG proposes the following changes to the current voting process:

| Current Process | Proposed Changes |
| --- | --- |
| [Monday] Call for Comments Mail | [Monday] Call for Comments Mail/Call for Vote Mail |
| [Monday to Thursday] Discussion and Feedback period. | [Monday to Friday] Discussion and Feedback period |
| [Friday] Call for Vote Mail | [Friday to Sunday] Time to implement feedback |
| [Monday] Voting Ends | [Monday] Voting starts; it will be sent with upcoming braindumps. |

Proposed Solution:

1. Extend the feedback period to Friday, providing more time for members to engage with proposals and give valuable suggestions.
2. Allow a reworking phase (Friday to Sunday) for proposers to incorporate feedback and finalize the proposal before voting.
3. Shift the voting time to Monday, allowing members who unplug during the weekend to participate in the voting process. This will also allow us to batch up the Call for Comments and Call for Vote emails.
4. Encourage active involvement in the DAO by discussing the importance of voting in Discord conversations and reminding members of their responsibilities.

Since this is the first proposal that discusses the process (since Proposal #11), we would also like to use it to codify and reaffirm a few related things.

1. For a draft proposal to be sent out in the Call for Comments Mail, it needs to be sent to the Agreements Coordinator on or before Sunday, 23:59 UTC. Any proposal submitted after this will be sent out the following week (unless the Agreement Coordinator decides otherwise).
2. The Agreements Coordinator must send out the Call for Comments and Call for Voting Mail every week before Monday, 19:00 UTC (if any proposals need to be sent out for comments or voting). The agreements Coordinator may (with prior notice) change these times to ones that are more convenient for their time zone.
3. If the DAO Council decides that a proposal is very time sensitive, it can choose to expedite the process and reduce the time for comments. Such a change needs to be clearly conveyed in the Call for Comments email.
4. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, only one Call for Comments/Call for Voting mail will be sent every week.
5. Each draft proposal needs to have a small blurb that summarizes what the proposal is about. For example, a suitable blurb for this proposal might be:
    - ‚ÄúThis proposal aims to improve voting processes and increase voter turnout by amending the current agreements process.‚Äù
    
    The email will include these summaries when the proposal is sent out for feedback/vote.
    

By implementing these proposed changes, we aim to improve the voting process in the Dream DAO, encourage more active participation among members, and ensure that the quorum is met for all proposals. This will facilitate smooth and efficient decision-making, benefiting the entire organization!
