🎯**Goals:**

1. Create strategy for dreamlist for Skywalkerz drop #2 so we can get more information on demand
2. Kick off a group to discuss the dreamlist strategy as part of the broader marketing plan

🏋️**Point of Contact:**

Professor Stam 

💡**Description:**

It would be really useful to understand what type of demand we have for the second batch of skywalkerz before we reveal how many NFTs will be minted max during our one week timeline.  If we establish a dreamlist where interested people can sign up and submit their wallet addresses, we can understand how much demand is out there and retroactively set the amount we plan on allowing for mint.  This allows us to maximize our fundraising and get a feeling for how secondary market sales might play out.

A group of volunteers will work to establish who is on the dreamlist and when the release begins (non dreamlist launch date is June 12th).

💚**Benefits:**

- We are smarter about how many skywalkerz we allow for mint and don’t under or overshoot the demand
- A dreamlist allows us to ensure that certain people we want to have a skywalkerz are able to get it. People we believe would be great champions or contributors. With a public mint, there is a risk they do not get one if they are busy at the time
- People will feel more compelled to mint if they are on a dreamlist and it helps to grow the hype / spread the word

📈**Success Metrics:**

- A dreamlist is developed and launched ahead of the marketing campaign
- We get good intel on the demand for skywalkerz drop #2

- End: June 12th
