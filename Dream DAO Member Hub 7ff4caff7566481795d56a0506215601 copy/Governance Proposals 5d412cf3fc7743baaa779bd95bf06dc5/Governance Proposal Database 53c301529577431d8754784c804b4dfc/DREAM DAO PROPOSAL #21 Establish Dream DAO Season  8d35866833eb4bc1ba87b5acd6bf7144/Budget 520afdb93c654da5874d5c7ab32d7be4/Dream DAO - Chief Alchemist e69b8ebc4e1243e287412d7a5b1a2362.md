# Dream DAO - Chief Alchemist

Cost for Season 2: 28000
Explanation: We need a full-time or near-full time staff member tasked with ultimately being accountable for the successful completion of every DAO Season key result.

This “Alchemist” is also the default representative of the DAO to the public/media, devotes the long hours required to build trusting relationships that lead to grants and interest from potential strategic partners, and spearheads the process of evolving the DAO roadmap as needed.

This will be Civics Unplugged team member Gary Sheng for Season 2 (he will be dedicating 70% of his CU/Dream DAO staff time on Dream DAO work). There will be elections for this role for Season 3. Gary devotes 40-60 hours a week on Dream DAO related work a week.

There are four months in Season 2, thus we need to budget $28,000 for the Alchemist.
