# Dream DAO Working Groups

Cost for Season 2: 20000
DMC Comments: Is the $1000/mo per wg? Unclear. 

Also, will Gary and Madison be the only ones working across wgs? I think Charlotte and Ash (right name?) were also doing a lot of crossover work.
Explanation: We have several working groups within Dream DAO that each serves an important purpose. There will be a coordinator that receives a fixed payment each month for overseeing and being accountable for the working group. Each working group would also have some allocated budget, with different working groups likely having different budgets based on need. The working groups are as follows:

1. Governance 

2. Partnerships 

3. Community Building

4. Gatherings

Assume each coordinator receives up to $750 / month and there are 4 working groups. Each working group will have some additional allocated budget. There will be some TBD allocated budget for different working groups to reward members for going above and beyond normal contributions in their working groups. Letâ€™s assume an additional $500 / month until we figure out the exact numbers? So, $1,250 / wg / month, leading to $20,000 for Season 2 across wgs.
Priority: 1 - Must do
Prof Comments: These to me feel like they are in the  salaried type bucket as we are assigning a role at the beginning of the season and the expectation is the person performing that role in exchange for a steady annuity.  It is not a stipend per say but an agreement that they will conduct specific tasks and be compensated as such
