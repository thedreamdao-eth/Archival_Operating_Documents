💡**Description:**

- The aim is to send up to 100 “Optimism is the New Punk” shirts—each ~$30—for about $3,000 USD, and the payoff could literally be $100,000s due to the good vibes generated and amazing social media content generated
    - We will collect contact info and whatnot through paperform—Gary will send form.
    - We will use the info collected via paperform to order shirts on Teespring. It’s very simple. Someone besides Gary will do this part.
- We (not Gary, but Gary can be CCed) will send an email with the shipping tracking info as well as a personalized selfie video from one of our key contributors
    - with the tracking email, we should also attach a doc or page about donating to Dream DAO or how they could show their gratitude (like post on social media)

💚**Benefits:**

- Greater awareness of Dream DAO and the vibes we are spreading
- More money raised
- People, especially our existing contributors, are happy

📈**Success Metrics:**

1. Dollars raised from people who received a t-shirt
2. Number of social media posts from recipients of the shirt
3. Shirts and/or messages of thanks successfully delivered

🗓️**Duration:**
