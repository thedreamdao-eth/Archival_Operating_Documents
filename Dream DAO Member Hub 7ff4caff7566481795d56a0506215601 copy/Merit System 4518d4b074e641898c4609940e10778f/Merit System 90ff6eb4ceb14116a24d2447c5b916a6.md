## Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è

---

The Dream DAO merit system will recognize active engagement by measuring activity. 

Right now, it is hard to distinguish the difference between each Dream DAO member‚Äôs actual level of activity in the DAO. Two members could say they are a part of Dream DAO, but that could represent very different levels of engagement. 

With a merit system, we could change that. Think of the merit system as an on-chain resume of Dream DAO activities and accomplishments: it shows people inside and outside of Dream DAO just how engaged members are and what they have contributed. 

You can also think about it like Boy Scout badges.

Lots of people are Boy Scouts‚Äî but very few have lots of badges, and even fewer reach the highest level of recognition‚Äî ‚Äú[Eagle Scout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Scout)‚Äù. Someone can say that they are a Boy Scout, but people will not really understand the contributions they have made until they see the Boy Scout‚Äôs badges. 

### Non-Financial Recognition

Right now, the only way we can only recognize members for their contributions is money in the form of bounties. This works when there is a project, something to manage, or a specific achieved outcome, but it isn‚Äôt sustainable nor is it suitable to all types of merit-worthy activities. And financial rewards can actually harm the social fabric of the DAO if people only contribute when they are paid. 

### Beyond Recognition: Utility

Recognition is a valuable use of a merit system. Additionally, the merit system can also provide utility in the form of benefits to more active members of the DAO. 

We will use this merit system to allow members to qualify for certain perks based on the merit they have achieved. Members with more ****merit badges will given top-priority when it comes to selecting members for: 

- Conferences to attend
- Events to participate in
- Opportunities for additional projects or bounties, such as the Explorers Program

This also makes elections clearer and more transparent. Candidate will be able to promote their merit badges, and voters can refer to each candidate‚Äôs merit badges as an immutable and visible indicator of a candidate‚Äôs commitment to the DAO. 

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

---

The Dream DAO merit system will be **self-managing**. Instead of having one person in charge of tracking all activity in the DAO and then rewarding the relevant badges (which would be messy and unmanageable), members will be responsible for themselves: 

1. There will be a list of merit badges and instructions for how to obtain them 
2. Once a member completes a requirement for a badge, they will fill out a form with proof of completion
3. If an individual member or working group has defined a specific merit badge, the form will go to them to review
4. At the end of the month, the DAO council will approve all merit badge requests that meet the requirements, and they will be distributed

### Defining Merit Badges

Creating merit badges will be a decentralized effort, led by 3 groups: 

1. **Co-Stewards**: Will define badges that transcend the scope of any individual working group. Examples might include badges for speaking at a conference, recruiting 3 Learning Together guests, or participating in the Explorers Program. Co-stewards may design  up to 20 badges. 
2. **Working Group Leads**: Will decide badges relevant to the scope of their working group. Examples for, let‚Äôs say the Partnerships working group, might be: writing a grant application, adding 5 contacts to the CRM, or finding a new partner. Each working group should create ~5 badges. 
3. **Individuals submissions**: Will be able to submit ideas for merit badges in a form, which will get reviewed by the co-stewards. 

### Creating The Merit Badges (Tech)

Madhav is working on a system to issue merit badges as Polygon NFTs. More information coming on this soon!

We will use an AI art generator such as DALLE or MidJourney to create the image for the badges. The creator of the badge will work with Harry (or someone else with access to DALLE) to create the image for the badge. 

### Levels

Even if we have merit badges, each badge is inevitably going to be ‚Äúworth‚Äù more than others, aka not every contribution provides the same value to the DAO. 

To quantify this, each badge will be given a value of 1-3, 3 being the highest level of contribution (for instance, participating in the Explorers program), and 1 being the lowest (for instance, writing a proposal). 

At the end of the season, the average of the badges will be calculated for each member. Compare this to the 4.0 scale in the US- if the average of the badges are 1, the Builder is level 1 and if the majority are 2, then level 2, and so on. 

Levels will not be used to gatekeep Builders from opportunities, they are simply a way to measure/quantify engagement. For instance, any Builder will be able to run for working group leads, but voters may take the Builder‚Äôs ‚Äúlevel‚Äù into consideration when choosing their top candidates. The same goes for the Explorers Program, conferences, and more. 

### Retroactive Merit Badges

Season 1 Builders have already made major contributions to the Dream DAO. These contributions should not go without recognition‚Äî the should be retroactively rewarded. We will not create specific merit badges for Season 1‚Äî but when the Co-stewards, working group leads, and individuals create their merit badges, if Season 1 Builders qualify for that badge retroactively, they will fill out the form. 

### Bounties

Bounties can have merit badges assigned to them‚Äî there is no correlation but they may overlap. 

For example, let‚Äôs say Partnerships working group decides that filling out a grant application is worth a merit badge. However, the lead may also decide to reward a $30 bounty for the work. 

Essentially, we should see bounties as compensation for work and merit badges as recognition for contribution. Most of the time, bounties are time-bound and can only be completed by one person. But merit badges can be done at any time and completed by many individuals.
