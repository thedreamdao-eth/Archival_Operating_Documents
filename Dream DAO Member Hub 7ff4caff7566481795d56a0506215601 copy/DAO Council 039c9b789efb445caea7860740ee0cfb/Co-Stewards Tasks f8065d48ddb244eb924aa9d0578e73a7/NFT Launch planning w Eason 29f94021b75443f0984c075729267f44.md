# NFT Launch planning w/ Eason

Priority: High
Status: Not started

Overall timeline

Overall build

-Minting process

-Mints for during season champions -will I control this? Or needs you as a dev to send?

 

Specifics:

-1 of 1s
Only 1 of each, with a random background? But maybe not the plain colours… so maybe we just choose a background for each that’s cool. I know before that people were given specific ones, maybe we do that this time?

What do you need:
-Do we have access to previous wallet that deployed 

-You’ll send them function to execute on that - give them a guide - not dangerous functions - just changing a token url

-Is it a multisig? Add Eason in
