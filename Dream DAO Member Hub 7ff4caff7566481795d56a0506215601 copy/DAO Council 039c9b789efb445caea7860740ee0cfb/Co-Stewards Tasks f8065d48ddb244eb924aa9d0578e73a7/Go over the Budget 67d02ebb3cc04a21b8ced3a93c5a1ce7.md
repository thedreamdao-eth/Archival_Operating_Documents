### Questions for Carl/Mads

Tim’s

Would it be possible / better to do this on Notion? (or is there any hurdle to it?)

are To-do’s ready?

**Harry’s**

Areas of focus

1. Running the budget

-Is there no Explorers stipends this season? Will there be? How did you start the securing of explorer program positions…when to start hunting?

Summary

**S2 carryover, where to find?** 

**Did the income received update as you went on? We only have 75K promised with season, no income if I’m correct**

**Income:**

Celo - 60K to come

But old 60K, it says remaining 60K - Have we not spent some of this? 

Ethereum Foundation - 15K

Is NEAR all going to Near team? 20K? Only seems like 1500 used so far in S2 payments, maybe more payments to go? 

Gitcoin still untouched for both GR14+15 in DAI

Skywalkers in ETH - how do you think about USD vs ETH/DAI? 

Multisig - explain where data is from, what this is used for specifically? 

Skywalkers is that just giving to Builders and Getting from buyers (champs) - where is this from, how to put in excel - I will set up for the latest drop… 

On-chain tab

-starting balance $2172

Anything else? 

Where does **Skywalker + Multisig data come from?** How do we transfer from on-chain to excel? 

Celo - Do you know about this?

Trips - 15K for 10 builders

Other:

-1 Onboarding video (Do it as a bounty, and find someone to complete it) $400?
-1 Onboarding document (Do it as a bounty, and find someone to complete it) $400?
-Do 2 Celo leader interviews (2 examples are on our Twitter, previous bounties were $300)
-Do 3 Celo LTs (Look at past LTs in the database) - $20 bounty to reach out/find good Celo targets?
-Host 2 Regen Ragers meetups (Don't worry about that right now) - predicted budget? ~**$3000** each?

Total costs on Celo tasks: 22,460

Savings for operations: $37,540

- Butter subscription?

1. Opinions on choices
- WG lead payments, idea to go from 750 to the 500 avg, with 200 base stipend+ 300 in hours. But we’ve still added as 750, with an aim that this is our max max, where above 500 it has to be discussed with a Co-steward before going over. We left the 250 for this extra work. - probably will leave us with extra, but its cautionary.

Is skywalker gas fee 0.004?
