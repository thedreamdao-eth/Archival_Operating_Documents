## Jams

### **Payment + hours:**

I think the key idea is that as leads, always look out for when a task can be decentralized and carried out by a member of the WG, and when this is possible, pass the tasks to WG members, and then save your working hours for coordinating the tasks at the higher level and for high-skill tasks that can only be carried out by you. 

For future notice, we also want to try keep the max payment at $500 when possible. The breakdown is: 200 base pay + 300 hourly (17/hour) and if leads go beyond $500, the plan made last season is that they can submit a short message to Co-Stewards to explain the need to request above the $500 fee. This is just to allow the DAO to check that the budget is being spent on tasks that are necessary and the roles are carrying out tasks within their scope. We hope this doesn't sound too strict! The past leadership had some problems with very high requests at the end of the last season, for work carried out that went beyond the work of a WG lead role, and so the DAO has now put this system in place to prevent that from occurring again.

### WG Bounties

**When do I give bounties?** 

High skill + high value tasks, requiring significant time and effort contributions

**When to try lean away from bounties?**

1. Can be distributed to a group of builders (e.g. design docs, group idea brainstorming)
    1. Hard to determine who gets paid / how much
2. A task isn‚Äôt requiring much effort, is somewhat recurring (e.g. membership renewal)

**Why is this important for the DAO?**

It‚Äôs key to create an environment where **members are involved for experience first, and any monetary benefits second**. 

E.g. We‚Äôve been seeing that those who offer to take on a bounty to host LT sessions, if not chosen for the bounty, rarely attend these LT sessions. This shows a slight shift in mentality towards monetary focused work, away from work for the sake of learning. By not putting out bounties as often, we highlight and ensure the focus is on learning and building opportunities, and not solely money.

### **WG Management**

**Lets look at some successes and some improvement areas as a group:**

**Successes**

1. Task allocation going well for most. 
*To note:*
Many people will take on tasks but then may be slow in execution. To help with this:
    - Set clear timeframes for tasks (managed in WG task hub)
    - Try to stay away from being deeply involved in the task building itself, giving you more time to check in on all the tasks at a higher-level and guide from above
    - If no action from a builder, kindly nudge them (giving a level of progress needed within a timeframe)
    - If not achieved, don‚Äôt be afraid to add in new builders, especially when no bounties are involved. Above all it‚Äôs crucial tasks continue to progress.
2. Task database filling up nicely (Governance need to add)
3. WG update hub helping Marco and Rebeca
4. **Good post-meeting summaries for the most part, again just consistency with these could help.** 

**Possible improvement areas**

1. Consistency of the WG updates. Proposing a template to follow? These WG messages and Emails had a nice flow. Would we like to all adopt the same layout for DAO consistency?

2. Email lists and outreach
3. Events in the DD calendar (regular time locked in ‚Üí add to calendar)
4. Discord Events
5. **Pre-meeting agendas**
6. **Do we all have advisors? Are we making use of them? Get new ones if the old ones aren‚Äôt working!** 
7. Lets have more discussion in the council channel! E.g. share ideas that are relevant across Working Groups, suggest DAO-wide tasks that need focusing on. Discuss problems your facing and help use the council to decide. 

### **Twitter:**

We‚Äôve recently created a **#**üê¶|**dream-twitter** channel for Marco to communicate with the DAO. **Things we need WG help with:**

- **Visuals for our Twitter.** 
Would be great to activate our designer/artist builders on creating visuals for the DAO Twitter to improve/diversify our content.
    - More detailed description of what we need [**here**](https://discord.com/channels/896096170621947974/930246326661283960/1090185700705574983)
    - Do you have any designers in your WG? (e.g. the ones creating the Pitch Deck in Grants)
        - Luis, Keshav, Fernando
        - As a first more specific project, we need 2 templates in sizes of *(1600px X 900px) and (1080px x 1080px),* one for LT Quotes and another for LT Screenshots
- It would be really good to get the WG members involved on amplyfying the tweets. How could we potentially do that?

### Improvements Jam:

(Anything from successes, struggles, new suggestions) - lets Jam! 

### Look over Roadmap:

[S3 ROADMAP (DRAFT)](../S3%20ROADMAP%20(DRAFT)%207ad4875761314f5db4815a2fae1edab8.md) 

Once we finish this one, would be good to create a recurring (not time-bound) one to make sure future leadership have an easy way to see vital things for the DAO that they have to execute on and when
