# Objective

We will be hosting an Office Hours weekly, with the time to be decided Sunday night EST at the start of every week, to build community in the DAO and change the culture of “proposing” an idea to brainstorming together.

We’re going to call it “Daydreaming Jams” so that it feels informal and chill.
