Tying everything to why it enables good in the world + we can merge some topics within other topics!
Okay sorry that is a terrible breakdown, I am uninspired

**Basics**

- Blockchain
    - Transparent
    - Privacy
    - Security
    - Immutable + everything is traceable
- Smart Contracts
    - Enable trust
    - Encode how actions will be rewarded
    - No one person can override everyone
- DAOs
    - Protocol vs social
    - Ownership
    - Overriding government institutions
    - Global

**Technical** 

- Layer 1,2,3
- Most important tooling and how to use these
    - Include nuances like
        - How they affect mental fitness and experience in a DAO
        - How they make decision making more inclusive, etc
- Different Chains and how to best choose one for the purpose of projects

**Theoretical** 

- Decentralization
- Privacy
- Collaboration + Building blocks — ecosystem
- Purpose Driven Organizations
- Public Goods
- Systems thinking
- How to tackle problems through first principles

**Use Cases** 

- DAOs
    - Aligning communities towards a shared purpose
    - Leadership reinvented
    - 
- NFTs
    - Fundraising
    - Encode data — eg forest data so we can prevent carbon double spending
    - 
- DeFi (but from the lens of reaching the unbanked ) — Maybe Celo is a good example
- Crypto Economics for the Commons
    - Augmented Bonding Curves
    - Quadratic Funding
    - Purpose-driven Tokens

**Where are there flaws (potentially too much and only as an extra)**

- Smart Contracts do not bridge the physical with the virtual
- Better tooling
- Lack of governance participation
- Not everyone should get on-boarded the same way
- Tokenizing every single interaction

**Case Studies** 

- UBI — Proof of Humanity
- ReFi  —
    - money no longer backed by extractive methods
    - carbon markets
    - valuing nature
    - regeneration
        - Moss/Open Forest Foundation
        - Kolektivo
        - Eden
- Desi — open research
    - Openscia.eth
    - LabDAO
- Data Economy — ownership, privacy, monetization of data
    - Ocean Protocol
    - An example for Health Data
- Applied Research
    - Token Engineering Commons
    - CurveLabs
- Use case of DAOs scaling and the messiness and takeaways
