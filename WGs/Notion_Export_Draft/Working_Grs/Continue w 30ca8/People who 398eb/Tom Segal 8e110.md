> **Tell us a bit about yourself**👨🏻‍🚀
I am a graduate of Duke University (Class of 2009) who spends his days advocating for teens to skip college (sometimes)! Born and raised in New York, I enjoy golf, nfts, gambling on sports, shooting uncontested three pointers from the top of the key, binging The Wire on an annual basis, and breathing really quality oxygen, ideally flowing off of the pacific coast. 
I am the CEO of a family office where I mainly manage investment portfolios. I was formerly a co-founder of a venture capital firm called Rethink Education, where I invested in education technology startups across K-12, higher ed, corporate learning, and everything in between. I even used to be a prolific blogger in the sector (my apologies in advance if you google my work). 
I'm also on the board of the A.L. Mailman Family Foundation, which has given me the opportunity to work with the fine folks of Civics Unplugged in an official capacity. My favorite author is Kurt Vonnegut, my favorite artist is Takashi Murakami (@takashipom), and my favorite athlete is Thomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr. I make an egg sandwich that will change your outlook on life.

> **Fun fact about you**👨🏻‍🚀
I won all four of my fantasy baseball leagues last year and will most likely shed tears when the Major League officially goes on strike this season.

> **Favourite Quote**👨🏻‍🚀
"You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one" -John Lennon

> **Why did you join the Dream DAO?**👨🏻‍🚀
1️⃣I love the internet. I know the internet gives us the tools and connective tissue to bridge so many of the divides we face culturally and societally. I also know that I am not smart enough, intuitive enough, nor plugged in enough to properly align these tools in such a way as to evolve and affect positive change. 
2️⃣But I want to help those who can, and my best guess is that the builders of our future are highly likely to come from CU Fellows, and I want to help fund them, connect them, support them, and offer any guidance I may be able to provide along the way, even if it is simply the perspective of an aging millennial desperately trying to play catchup on web3 development.
3️⃣I have a great network across education and philanthropy, and I would love to start more intentionally connecting SkywalkerZ Builders with the companies and organizations that could most benefit from their skills and intellect.
4️⃣Also I just like the art.
