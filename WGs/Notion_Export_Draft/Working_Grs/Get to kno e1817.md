# The Value of Collaborating with Dream DAO!

**Web3 is an ever-growing space where new breakthroughs happen every day because of the ambitious ideas of the community. This is a space of initiative, and initiative requires an adventurous spirit, courage, and modern vision. The younger generation embodies these attributes and provides an optimistic, creative outlook towards society.** 

*But how do we get young people who have the motivation, skills, and bandwidth to help us build the web3 space?*

Dream DAO explorers are young civic-minded builders who have shown their commitment towards making a change by starting campaigns, organizations and initiatives. The Builders are hand-selected by the Dream DAO community after deliberation and discourse.   

Our Explorers go through an intensive digital-first program. [know more](https://www.notion.so/Dream-DAO-Programs-Grants-22344032d285469ca317031b7bc4d49f) 

They are mentored by our Champions, who are experts in adjacent fields and provide the wisdom and values for success. 

- They have shown evidence of their work ethic, ability to execute, and sharpness of thinking.
- For being part of the program, they expressed interest and commitment to make an impact.

Our builders are already doing great things in different disciplines. Some of our Builders are part of the Gitcoin DAO and work in the public goods space, while others are helping their local communities by educating them about web3.  They are a diverse group of individuals who have different thought processes, which is their superpower and allows them to see across the landscape and incorporate different views and mindsets.

# Where you come in!

For building a better-decentralized future there needs to be input from people of all ages, especially Gen Zers because they are the ones inheriting the world from us and need to be present when we set the foundation of web3. 

This isn‚Äôt just an internship, it is a stepping stone for teens who have high potential to do good in the world and make a positive impact, and you get the chance to help the future regen web3 builders become real changemakers.
