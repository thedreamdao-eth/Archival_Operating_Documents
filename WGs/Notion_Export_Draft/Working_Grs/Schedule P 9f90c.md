Hey @fundraising, 

Here’s a quick update on what’s happening:

1. @julia and @ash are leading the creation of the fundraising toolkit
2. Many of us are working on the FTX Future Fund grant application

Nevertheless, I want to keep pushing more to get as much funds as possible. So, let’s meet next week! Here are some possibilities:

- :one: <t:1647298800>
- :two: <t:1647302400>
- :three: <t:1647388800>
- :four: <t:1647385200>
- :x: If none of the times work for you

In the meantime, please stay on the lookout for any grants/companies that are getting into the education or web3 space!

Hey! I’m in the process of scheduling the next fundraising wg session for Dream DAO, and would appreciate if you could take a second and react to the times that work because the options are coming up soon. Thanks!
