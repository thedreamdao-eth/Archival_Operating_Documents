Lead: Shaan Patel, Timofei Dort-Golts
Status: Started
Working Group(s): https://www.notion.so/Governance-WG-a464f56462524c87842951a5c5d8b9f0

## Thoughts

Create a dataset in excel to draft the merit systems 

Add the CSV of people (just the names + social media handles)

 Activity system (Pillar 1) - **Amount of** LTs attended, WG tasks completed, One-off tasks like POAPs, Unique contributions(Julia’s website, gm bot) later add more

Social system  (Pillar 2) - taco quantity, maybe amount of 1:1’s later add more

Sum of the specific contribution of a person/overall sum of the specific contribution=standard metric percentage

| Proposal signer 
A person | Number of proposals  | Num of proposals submitted | Number of proposals passed | The average number of votes for a proposal | LT |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Next meeting:** discuss how to present our progress on the tasks (what we are working on rn + our progress so far)
